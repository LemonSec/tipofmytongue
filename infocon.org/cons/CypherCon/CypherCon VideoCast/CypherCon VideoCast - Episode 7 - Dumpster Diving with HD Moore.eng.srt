and uh let's jump in right away and uh

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,680
you know i thought that maybe we could

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,480
start with

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,559
um your background how did you how did

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,079
you get into

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
this uh you know wonderful uh career

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,280
and all the achievements that you had

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,559
for yourselves like what were your early

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,920
days like how did you get into hacking

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,440
how did you get into

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,160
tinkering and you know finding exploits

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,399
and doing all this kind of stuff

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,760
a lot of it just comes out of like being

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,359
poor and growing up in texas with you

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,039
know no real funding and so

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
you know you walk you know walk to and

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
from school you find trash in the ground

34
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,720
you find

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,680
chunks of computers hanging in a

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
dumpster you start building stuff you're

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,080
trying to try to make like one

38
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,360
functional computer of all the parts you

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,000
find

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
um i spent a lot of time sneaking at

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
computer labs you know before and after

42
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,000
school and

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,200
playing around with apple tvs is

44
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
generally trying to get a feel for like

45
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,200
how they worked

46
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
how to write and they kind of that led

47
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,880
to getting involved with you know the

48
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,360
kind of

49
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
freaking telephone scene here in town

50
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
which was you know

51
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,320
you know free internet dialing random

52
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,000
bbs is trying to either

53
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,960
um get access to other bbs's the whole

54
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
calling card thing to go you know over

55
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
you know long distance calls back then

56
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,439
which sort of thing so generally just

57
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,479
trying to explore kind of what the

58
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,680
telephone numbers look like and that

59
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,720
eventually became

60
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
a strong focus on where down uh which is

61
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,439
you know dialing huge ranges of numbers

62
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,040
from as many modes as i could find

63
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,159
trying to figure out what was out there

64
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
connecting all kinds of random stuff

65
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
from you know hvac systems tied to large

66
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
department stores to

67
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
radio towers and old linux machines and

68
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,479
you know prime os and everything else in

69
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,840
between

70
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
holy spokes so you you found what

71
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,799
what made you want to build computers in

72
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
the first place like how did you first

73
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
like can you remember like what your

74
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,840
first experience was like

75
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
oh i want to build a computer oh yeah

76
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,679
definitely so i'm

77
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,520
probably when i got so i got kicked out

78
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
of school a lot so every time i got

79
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,000
kicked out of school i lost access to

80
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,280
school computers right i came from the

81
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
lab so i had to find something to play

82
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:16,959
with

83
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,720
so i kept trying to like build parts out

84
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,319
of leftovers i found it dumpster dough a

85
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,040
lot i

86
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
pulled things out of the trash

87
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
everywhere i could find it uh took about

88
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,599
a year and a half to my first 46 and

89
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
i was just building you know about half

90
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
a modem here half a mode in there you

91
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
know hard drive over here

92
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,480
cpu over there motherboard there i

93
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,680
finally got the machine set up

94
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
and i had a like you know shirt with a

95
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,560
pocket on the front i remember like

96
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
leaning over

97
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
pushing power hearing that thing finally

98
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,959
kick on the fans were up you heard the

99
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
the virus post beep and then a penny

100
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,080
fell out of my pocket went right in the

101
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,120
motherboard and shorted the whole thing

102
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,280
out and discarded from scratch

103
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,599
holy smokes that's awesome how did you

104
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,720
so did you find

105
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
dumpsters that you had a lot of

106
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
computers in it like how did you locate

107
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
was it like okay this is a computer

108
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
company or a school you knew that

109
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,560
they're getting rid of computers they're

110
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
like where'd you find these things in

111
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,800
the dumpster everywhere i mean

112
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
apartment complexes were great because

113
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,680
people would throw away all kinds of

114
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,000
stuff

115
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
uh telephone companies for sure you have

116
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,040
to jump the razor wire and stuff to get

117
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
back there and go through all their junk

118
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
all my own telco manuals were pulled

119
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,319
directly at the trash bt back in the day

120
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,920
uh so i still like my old oc3

121
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,440
multiplexer manuals and all my old like

122
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,959
default login scripts were all basically

123
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,159
pulled directly out of the telephone

124
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,519
company's trash back then

125
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,519
holy smokes razor wire and everything

126
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,200
you're you're hardcore man that's

127
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,319
awesome you're

128
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,080
really dedicated so how did that um

129
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
like those early experiences and really

130
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
love for computers

131
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,159
how did you know and freaking and you

132
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,560
know

133
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
all that kind of stuff how did that

134
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
inform uh

135
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
you know what you created with uh

136
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
medisplay what became medisplay

137
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,519
oh metaplay was a kind of like a big

138
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,040
amiibo roller project like

139
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
most people know these days is like the

140
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
big software package that it is and all

141
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
the exploits things like that but it

142
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
started off being a research project

143
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
and the idea was like let's start taking

144
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,680
all these random ideas and random

145
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
presentations that our friends have

146
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
that we had and start putting together

147
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,159
the one giant containing you know

148
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,799
container

149
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
stuff so it started off with uh show

150
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,920
output development trying to get shell

151
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
output sizes and windows down really

152
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,840
small

153
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,040
uh we spent a lot of time things like

154
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
power sea shell code and then uh

155
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,319
from there i kind of looked at building

156
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
out exploits and you know at the time i

157
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,799
was working in a uh

158
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
mssp um heading the red team at the time

159
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
and we had a crappy pile of tools we

160
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,920
needed better tooling

161
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
so we started putting together um you

162
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
know this kind of clean version of all

163
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,720
the tools that we had and realized this

164
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
tool still sucks because at the time if

165
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
you want to swap out the payload you

166
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,960
want to go to blind shell reverse shell

167
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
you need to go

168
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
you know rebuild the exploit from

169
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
scratch and half the time um

170
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,639
the characters that you had to avoid in

171
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,160
the shell code like null bytes things

172
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,960
like that

173
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
were different for exploit for per tool

174
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,160
so

175
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
that really led to the design of like

176
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,199
metasploits kind of lego like model

177
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,600
where

178
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
you take a payload you can exploit an

179
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
off an encoder um and you kind of put

180
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,080
them all together and build kind of

181
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
dynamic exploit runtime

182
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
and use that and so i wrote in the

183
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
language i knew at the time which is

184
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
pearl managed to convince a couple other

185
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,199
smart people to join the team

186
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
mostly because they made fun of my code

187
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
and i told them to do better so they did

188
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
that was spoon and escape and then we

189
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,800
kind of rolled through that for a couple

190
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,240
years and it turned into

191
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
uh early on it was kind of widely panned

192
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,479
as a scripty tool and people made fun of

193
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
it but the idea really was just to

194
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
stop letting research die in the mind

195
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
like when someone has a cool idea

196
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,320
actually implement it and make it part

197
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
of this thing that we just keep

198
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,400
maintaining going forward

199
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
and so if you want to talk you know half

200
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
the time you go to death count you see

201
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
really cool talk

202
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
two years later no one remembers that

203
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
talk right you have to really we want to

204
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
make research applicable

205
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
you know real world useful and that's

206
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
kind of where next week came from and

207
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
what it became

208
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
that's it it's kind of like taking it's

209
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
kind of like the you know the concept of

210
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,840
like continuous deployment which is kind

211
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,320
of

212
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
ubiquitous now you know everyone's using

213
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,479
agile and that kind of stuff and

214
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,120
and but and when did you originally make

215
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
that a split

216
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
um the first code was back in like late

217
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,600
2002

218
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,639
and then i think we had our first

219
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
release in 2003. and so that's kind of

220
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,039
what you're

221
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,800
doing is like kind of continuously

222
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
adding on to these things and it seems

223
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,280
like you know

224
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,120
that wasn't the thing that you did at

225
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
the time and and so people are

226
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
like what what is what is this you know

227
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,160
but but now it's like that's the thing

228
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
that you do is you're constantly

229
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
improving you're constantly

230
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,319
adding to your um your software

231
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,520
you know back then the challenge was

232
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
exploits weren't something you took for

233
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
granted like a lot of folks thought

234
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
exploits should be illegal or that they

235
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
were illegal and didn't know better

236
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
this is back when just port scanning

237
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
somebody we locked up in jail so

238
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,319
the whole um view of the world was very

239
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,600
different back then uh

240
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
people thought exploits were these you

241
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
know dangerous things created by

242
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
criminals which they were but they're

243
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
also useful for contests and security

244
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
auditing and everything else and

245
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
if you're working ids or a security

246
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,039
solution or a firewall you need

247
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
experts to test that too so it ended up

248
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
being this kind of weird world where

249
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
half the security industry desperately

250
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,280
depends on having the exploits do the

251
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,759
job

252
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,039
the other half absolutely hated them

253
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,880
didn't want to exist and

254
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
that's why i kind of pushed the bar from

255
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
moving exploits from this kind of shady

256
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,919
underground activity to something that

257
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,720
everyone kind of

258
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
you know use like regular tools like a

259
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
port scanner like anything else

260
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,280
huh yeah and so that's yeah that kind of

261
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
like

262
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,160
it's like sort of like inventing the gun

263
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
you know it's like

264
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,400
you're using this tool and uh and

265
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,599
that like you can do it like it's you're

266
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
able to kind of you know take all these

267
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720
exploits instead of like

268
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
having to cherry-pick and you know

269
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
there's some issues with figuring out

270
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,560
how to use

271
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,520
you know different ones or whatever and

272
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
um

273
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
you know but i guess i guess the other

274
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
side of it and i'm curious

275
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,479
to learn a little bit about this is is

276
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,120
you know

277
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
uh you know like the same thing with a

278
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
gun like you can be a good guy or a bad

279
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
guy with a gun right

280
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,039
and um i'm curious to learn about like

281
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
what was the response from people at the

282
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,479
time as far as like

283
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
hey you're just like giving uh you know

284
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
nefarious hackers like some

285
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
more tools to be you know to hack into

286
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,520
things like what

287
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
what you know what kind of flak did you

288
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
get from people if you did

289
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,160
don't i don't know for a fact that you

290
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,639
did but uh um

291
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
you know what what sort of criticisms

292
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
did you get and how did you respond to

293
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,840
those criticisms and

294
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,639
how did that kind of evolve over time

295
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,280
yeah sure

296
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
um so all kinds of criticism like both

297
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
from my employer from our customers

298
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
from friends from people on the internet

299
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,919
from random companies you know there's

300
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
everyone the mom has an opinion about uh

301
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,440
whether you should disclose

302
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
vulnerabilities where they should

303
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
release exploits uh and so we took the

304
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,599
problem and we basically said we're just

305
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,479
gonna keep doing what we're doing we're

306
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,919
gonna keep releasing stuff until someone

307
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,120
stops us and they did

308
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,599
and where they tried we won um ended up

309
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,960
being uh you know i had a

310
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
large soccer company trying to get me

311
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,599
fired from my job for multiple years got

312
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
pulled in front of board hearings all

313
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
kinds of crap

314
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
so it at the end of nato i feel like we

315
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,759
made exploits

316
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
what they are today which is a tool that

317
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
you use as part of security work not as

318
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,080
this

319
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
special scary it's not like a virus

320
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,640
where it's going to take over your whole

321
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
network it's not like something's it's

322
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
you know wantingly destructive that

323
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
there is no values for

324
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,799
exploits are a very valid way to test

325
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,719
security to uh make sure patches are

326
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
being applied there's we kind of

327
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
made turn them from this kind of scary

328
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
thing people weren't really sure what to

329
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,519
do with to

330
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,880
kind of just get another boring tool in

331
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
the toolbox and a lot of people didn't

332
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,880
like that

333
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
both folks on the black outside didn't

334
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
like the fact that our exploits were

335
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
widely available and often more reliable

336
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
than their exploits and for the same bug

337
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,480
but also that uh they just didn't like

338
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
the fact that it was that widely known

339
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,519
like all the cool mystique that came

340
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,640
with like doing explain

341
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,560
development um you know is less cool

342
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
when it's widely built right so

343
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
i think we took from the shine off of

344
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
exploit dev back then but i also think

345
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
it helped raise the bar and also help

346
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
uh the rest industry accept that

347
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
exploits were just you know a tool you

348
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,120
need to use to do your job

349
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
yeah i like that and i think you know

350
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
one of the strongest

351
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
disinfectants is sunlight right and so

352
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,399
that's what you're doing is shining a

353
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
light on like here's here's

354
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
here's the bugs here here's how you can

355
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,519
exploit them and

356
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,200
and uh you know here's how we can find

357
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
them fix them make it better and and by

358
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,480
reporting all that and having that you

359
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,800
know

360
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
transparent to the public it's doing

361
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
everyone uh

362
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
a good right yeah i mean we had a strong

363
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
focus on ids evasion back in the day too

364
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,080
because the goal was

365
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
let's make it clear that these tools

366
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
don't actually work like you can't build

367
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
a good ideas for the smb protocol or the

368
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
dc-rpc part of all it's really hard to

369
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
go to those particles reliably

370
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,200
there's so many different ways to

371
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
fragment it something's out of order do

372
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,480
multi-binds all this crazy stuff you can

373
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,519
do in the protocol itself

374
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,959
that none of the defensive tool vendors

375
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,000
were taking into account when they built

376
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,720
their products

377
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
so a lot of what we did in that is

378
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
making it very clear very obvious that

379
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
the existing security solutions aren't

380
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
actually working properly and they can't

381
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,079
detect these attacks

382
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,760
and that pushed the whole industry to

383
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,279
try hard and do things differently now

384
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,560
you know we are where we are today for a

385
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,519
bunch of reasons but

386
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
i think uh the work that went into

387
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,720
metasploits

388
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
ids support and protocol invasion

389
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,480
definitely helped

390
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
cool uh so what are you what are you

391
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
working on these days what's uh

392
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
what's going on i mean the was kind of

393
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
what got me in the security was being

394
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,000
able to explore the big unknown back

395
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,279
then it was like telephone networks and

396
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,880
it was like scanning id space and i

397
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,519
spent a lot of time

398
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,800
working in project sonar about the

399
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
sevens getting all that before

400
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
uh and i feel like i still love that i

401
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,320
still love the idea of just exploring

402
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
network spaces like

403
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
the fact you can pick any numbers in one

404
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
and four billion right now and it's

405
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,680
probably a valid device

406
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,800
it's probably a valid server that's

407
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
crazy but you can just like pick a

408
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,880
number out of

409
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,079
thin air and it somehow belongs to

410
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,600
someone's printer in malaysia that's

411
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
that's awesome

412
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
so i love that stuff so i started

413
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,160
working on a platform called rumble

414
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
never discovery

415
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
which is to help companies identify all

416
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,399
the network connected assets internally

417
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,279
and externally

418
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,880
so instead of it being like uh internet

419
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
wide scan we're constantly like we're

420
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
running a scan across the whole internet

421
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
our customers scan their own stuff with

422
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
their own hardware with our agents

423
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,600
installed

424
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,040
and it builds a big inventory of all the

425
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
things and ideas that we take all the

426
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
cool techniques from

427
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
kind of the pen testing red team side of

428
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
the house things like um you know doing

429
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
segmentation analysis

430
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
identifying topologies uh finding

431
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,959
information links to tell you about

432
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
secondary interfaces things like that uh

433
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,320
really small information links you can

434
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,600
use to determine exactly what a device

435
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:31,920
is

436
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200
and combining that with the iq side of

437
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,279
analysis which things like communication

438
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,440
uh object id databases uh lots of

439
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
fingerprinting things like that

440
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,240
so you try to kind of bind both sides

441
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,279
and give you a really good view of

442
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,240
what's on the network without

443
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
credentials really quickly

444
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,279
uh so we've got a free version it works

445
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
for most folks there's like 156 assets

446
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,480
which most homes

447
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,320
most small businesses can use for free

448
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,680
um and it's a lot of fun so it's a fun

449
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,320
tool for

450
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
you know it's if you look at tools like

451
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
uh in map or other scanning tools

452
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
they're very focused on

453
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
telling you what services a particular

454
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
device is running we focus very much on

455
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
telling you what that device actually is

456
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,680
and how it's connected

457
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
huh interesting and do you find that a

458
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,200
lot

459
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
of small businesses like they have stuff

460
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,839
on the network they're like what is this

461
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,320
or like is that kind of like one of the

462
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
you know one of the benefits that you

463
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,720
bring to

464
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
some of these companies oh for sure i

465
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,079
mean we help out you know oftentimes

466
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,959
we'll

467
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,079
someone just scans the networks they

468
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,200
know about but typically find about

469
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,399
twenty percent more stuff than

470
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
they have once we help them find what

471
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,279
their all the other networks are the

472
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
ones that were aren't being covered

473
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
with their current management then it's

474
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,680
usually forty percent like we just find

475
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
so much more stuff because we look for

476
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,839
it differently

477
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
uh and it's a different model um there's

478
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,040
a lot of things that wouldn't really be

479
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
safe to scan with standard security

480
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,120
tools

481
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
we have a custom scan engine that's

482
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
designed to be you know safe to use in

483
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,000
clinical environments ot ics

484
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,399
everything like that so uh not to

485
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,240
infomercial soapbox too much but

486
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
like i think it's a cool way to explore

487
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,440
networks and it's much safer to use than

488
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
your standard security scanners cool no

489
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,040
that no

490
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
feel free to soak box away i mean i'm

491
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
happy that

492
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,079
to learn about what you're doing and you

493
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
know if it provides value to other folks

494
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,079
you know

495
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,480
um a lot of stuff is just long it's

496
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,680
rolling up all the techniques from like

497
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
nut display from pre-metasploit days

498
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
internet scanning days

499
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
um so there's a bunch of open like the

500
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
tools of this commercial we have a bunch

501
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,399
of open source projects we contribute

502
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:12,880
back to

503
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,000
we've maintained a macro editor's

504
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
database in conjunction with the d-mac

505
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,000
folks

506
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,279
uh we have this giant fingerprint

507
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,959
database we work on that's the same

508
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
fingerprint database used by an expose

509
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,160
and by metasploit investment pro

510
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
is the same when using we're using

511
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
rumble as well so that fingerprint

512
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
database is called re-cog and it's a

513
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,839
great way to like fingerprint anything

514
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,480
basically

515
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
so we've been uh dumping data into that

516
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,839
trying to find ways to print more stuff

517
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
uh we work with like the wrap seven

518
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,680
teams they add fingerprints for project

519
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,560
cylinder

520
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
scanning we add stuff that our customers

521
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
see internally um

522
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
and just trying to make a much better

523
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,040
set of tools to help fingerprint what's

524
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,079
out there

525
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,680
that's awesome that was something that

526
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
so i think before we got started i

527
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
mentioned that i had this uh cyber

528
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
security startup and

529
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
uh we kind of had a lot of you know id

530
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,360
we never actually like

531
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,680
fully went into you know building a

532
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
product we were looking for a paid

533
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
customer first type thing but

534
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,480
one of the things that we found is just

535
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,000
by like searching showdown

536
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,839
and like finding you know these

537
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,519
different devices all over the place and

538
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,880
finding out you know what version of

539
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
linux they're running and knowing that

540
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,880
there's

541
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,959
you know these known exploits or you

542
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,480
know that aren't patched you know from

543
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
that version and stuff like that so

544
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
um you know we were thinking about like

545
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
how can we

546
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
you know uh take this information and

547
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
let the companies know and let them know

548
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,720
how to

549
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,959
make sure that they know um you know

550
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
what devices are on their network what

551
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,760
they're running and where

552
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
where the potential exploits are and

553
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
stuff and that's what you're doing so

554
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,920
or i should ask is that what you're

555
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
doing and uh how's it going

556
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,120
mostly yeah i mean there's a lot of

557
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,639
folks doing just external these days

558
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,920
you've got folks like the discovery

559
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
census sheldon of course a bunch of

560
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
other folks that do external monitoring

561
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,720
we focus on doing mostly internal

562
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,079
corporate networks so we do like lots of

563
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
large hospitals lots of large enterprise

564
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
uh state governments things like that

565
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,279
and you know the cool thing about that

566
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,160
is we're able to

567
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
help them explore their internal network

568
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,279
stuff that you never see on show because

569
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,240
it's never going to be sort of

570
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,079
exposed right right we see devices that

571
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,519
you just you wouldn't see anywhere else

572
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
like strange radio towers microwave

573
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,920
links

574
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
uh all kinds of crazy clinical gear all

575
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
kinds of you know weird industrial stuff

576
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,680
that

577
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
you know if you see on the internet it's

578
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
already a problem but we see a lot of it

579
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
in turn so it's kind of cool being able

580
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,240
to

581
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,320
uh work in a space that is kind of like

582
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
the the lesser scene side of network

583
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
discovery

584
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,079
cool and you mentioned a couple times

585
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,920
project sonar i'm not familiar with it

586
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,199
can you just tell me a little bit about

587
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,720
what project sonar is

588
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,079
yeah like so metasploit was a good way

589
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
to get sued and project project center

590
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,120
was a really good way to get suited too

591
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
so when i was working around seven we

592
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,120
started this research

593
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
project where it was very short and like

594
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,920
we're gonna go scan the whole internet

595
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,040
constantly and we're gonna give all the

596
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920
data away for free

597
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,279
so we kept doing that did that for our i

598
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,480
think it's still running now so the team

599
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
still has an open data platform

600
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
but the cool thing about that is all the

601
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
bulk data is free you can go download

602
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
gigs and gigs and gigs of just raw data

603
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
and comb through it and that data

604
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
includes like a full dns database of the

605
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
entire internet

606
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
uh like billions of records every host

607
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
name ever pulled out of server

608
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
transparency tls

609
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,600
web crawling link discovery all kinds of

610
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,959
stuff so it's a really cool

611
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
um data set to do data money on to build

612
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,399
fingerprint spam just to learn more

613
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
about how the internet works

614
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
wow and so you mentioned it's a good way

615
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,480
to get sued

616
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
i mean have uh people come after you and

617
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,680
you know tried to sue you and like how

618
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
you know if you're comfortable talking

619
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
about it obviously if it's if it's

620
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
something

621
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
all kinds of fun stuff like there's a

622
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
couple iterations of the project before

623
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
became project sonar

624
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,759
one of them uh i started i got like

625
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
indicted on a grand jury for subpoena

626
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,199
like like never actually went to court

627
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,480
they finally dropped the facebook work

628
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,959
out there but

629
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
lots of scary letters lots of scary

630
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,320
stuff um basically uh

631
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
if you if you're scanning the entire

632
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
internet then if there's any compromise

633
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
any criminal activity anywhere

634
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
your ip's also in the log so they just

635
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
say okay let's pull all the ips that we

636
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,040
ever saw in this box

637
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
at this time period obviously they're

638
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
all criminals even though we're just

639
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,880
scanning everything all the time

640
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
so we also have folks like um cso for

641
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,720
state government get really mad that

642
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,759
we're scanning uh

643
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,040
it devices in the state over the

644
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
internet i'm like you know everyone else

645
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,839
is scanning already right like yes but

646
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,800
we know who you are i'm like yeah

647
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,839
because we're telling you where you are

648
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,120
like we're trying to get front and open

649
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
about this but they got really mad and

650
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,560
demanded that we never scan any

651
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,759
computers anymore in that particular

652
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,320
state

653
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
and it was it was quite silly and but

654
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,120
they wouldn't tell us what their ip

655
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,079
space was because they didn't know

656
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:02,639
either

657
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,480
so that turned into like a week-long

658
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
like doing all the research to figure

659
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,599
out what their ip space was so we could

660
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
stop scanning it so they would know

661
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,839
their id's and they never replied

662
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,199
anywhere emails but

663
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
yeah lots of chaos lots of threats uh

664
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,959
lots of scary letters

665
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
wow holy smokes so what was i mean

666
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
i mean when you when you started doing

667
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,880
this you probably anticipated that that

668
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,559
was going to happen right and

669
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,679
you know what was your i guess i mean

670
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,880
what was your what's your strategy

671
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
behind that it sounds like it's just

672
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,720
like be

673
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
open and uh you know transparent and

674
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,080
honest as possible

675
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
but well full on and get through it

676
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,280
right i mean that's the thing about

677
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,640
metasploit too like i had my name on the

678
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,919
whole thing going through the project i

679
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
never used like a handle or anything

680
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,000
like that so

681
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
uh we got a lot of uh ddos attacks we

682
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,520
got a lot of death threats we all kind

683
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
of crazy eagle like you know angry hate

684
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
mail all the time

685
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
um but it's fine now that it's done no

686
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,840
one cares anymore right but it was

687
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,960
trying to make it the norm trying to

688
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
make it exploit norm just like we tried

689
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
to make scanning the normal with

690
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,080
projects in our

691
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
showdown was already doing an awesome

692
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
job and making it kind of a standard

693
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,600
thing people knew about

694
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
but there were very few like large

695
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
security companies doing uh

696
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
active internet wide scanning at the

697
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,679
time so it was a good way to like put

698
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,120
another name behind it and make it feel

699
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,080
like it's something that

700
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,280
people should be doing more they should

701
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
be treating like a criminal activity

702
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
wow that's awesome that's that's super

703
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,720
courageous you know my hat's off to you

704
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,200
i mean

705
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
when you're going through this i mean

706
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
did you have a lot of anxiety around

707
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,320
like

708
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
you know i mean i can't imagine what

709
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
that's like if you have like

710
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,320
whole state agencies coming after you

711
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,039
like

712
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
uh it's not much fun sometimes but it

713
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
was worth it right i feel like

714
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
that made things normal that made things

715
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,679
uh it opened the door for other people

716
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,039
to work on similar projects right i feel

717
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,360
like

718
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,640
because of metasploit people weren't

719
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
scared to publish exploits anymore uh

720
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
because of project sonar other companies

721
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,039
were willing to get involved with

722
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,480
internet wide scanning contribute back

723
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
to these kind of global research

724
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
so i feel like that's those are the

725
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,039
table stakes you have to put some risk

726
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
out there to make it normal and that's

727
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
what we did

728
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
wow that man that's that's incredible i

729
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,760
uh

730
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,720
i i yeah i'm amazed that you know you

731
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,520
have the courage

732
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,799
and like the tenacity to do this and uh

733
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,679
and it you know it worked out i mean you

734
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
you did like raise the bar

735
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
on you know uh transparency and

736
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
security and and you know you were part

737
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,760
of the

738
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
the architect that made it to what what

739
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,080
it is today so that's that's amazing

740
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
this is a huge community right it was

741
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,880
you know product sound was a huge team

742
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
it was all our lawyers were very helpful

743
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,880
too

744
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
it was nice working for a large company

745
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
when that was going on because they

746
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
could help cover me a little bit

747
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
metasploit was just you know i think

748
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,400
almost like 300 people by five or six

749
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
years in so it was a huge community as

750
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,160
well

751
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
and those folks are still contributing

752
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,559
it's still an awesome group of people to

753
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,280
work with so

754
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
it was just really great being able to

755
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,559
work with all these folks who care about

756
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,240
the same things and really want to

757
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
you know see the status quo change

758
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
that's awesome uh

759
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,799
well do you have any uh you know final

760
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,919
words of advice

761
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,880
or plugs or where people can find you

762
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,679
that uh you want to share before we uh

763
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,520
sign off here sure yeah probably easiest

764
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
is twitter these days my dms are open

765
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,080
just hdmore

766
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
um and then on github hdm is my handle

767
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
there uh for any products working on

768
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,720
these days

769
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
uh rumble that run is what i do for work

770
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
these days that is rumble.run on the

771
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,200
website and then uh you can always reach

772
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
me at you know htmlrumble.run as well by

773
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,760
email

774
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,080
um but yeah i think uh the only thing i

775
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,720
can really recommend is

776
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,000
one of the challenges i run into like

777
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
starting new projects is that i feel

778
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
like overthink them and it takes me a

779
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
long time to finally feel comfortable

780
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
with the new thing that i want to do

781
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
and what usually works better is just to

782
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,039
shut up and do it like just go face down

783
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,679
and just do

784
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,799
you know two weeks straight at work on

785
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,400
that thing and then two weeks into it

786
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,919
okay feel like okay did i make enough

787
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,280
progress that i understand where this

788
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,640
thing is going where i want to be

789
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
or is this a complete waste of time but

790
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
trying to judge it before you really

791
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,120
spend a good two weeks of effort on it i

792
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
don't think works

793
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,440
and so anybody wants to start a business

794
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
or explore an idea start a research

795
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,240
project i feel like you need at least

796
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,520
two weeks in before you can really make

797
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
that call

798
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
cool that's awesome and that was one

799
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
other thing i i forgot to

800
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
to ask you about i read your uh paper on

801
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
i think it was metasploit and money or

802
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,600
something like that

803
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
and i thought it was a really cool paper

804
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
because it kind of went through like the

805
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
whole

806
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,640
um you know act of of of monetizing and

807
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
like what went into

808
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
you know figuring out how to i think you

809
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,080
were

810
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
leasing out the software or like how to

811
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320
monetize it and

812
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
and i thought that uh yeah in addition

813
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
to what you just said like is there any

814
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,120
advice that you have to folks that you

815
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
know maybe they're working on

816
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,400
you know a passion project or a side

817
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
hustle or something and they're looking

818
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,480
to

819
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
monetize it or turn it again it it turn

820
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,840
it into a full

821
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
time gig like do you have any uh advice

822
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,039
to

823
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,200
folks and and now uh i'll actually link

824
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,240
that that paper

825
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
that i read because i thought even

826
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
though it was i think he wrote it you

827
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,120
know a few years back now but

828
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,640
um i found it to be um interesting to

829
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,000
get that insight in

830
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
you know how how you went about you know

831
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,480
like with the merger and acquisition

832
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,000
people and stuff like that i was just

833
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,559
like

834
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
i was like that's that's this is really

835
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,760
good insight so

836
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,080
um but yeah do you have any advice on

837

that end

838
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,600
uh sure i mean the that paper was

839
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,039
written probably about 10 years ago now

840
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:53,520
so it's

841
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
a little bit dated but yeah uh hbr like

842
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,679
harvard business review actually did a

843
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,000
study

844
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,360
of the metasploit acquisition as well so

845
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,480
they've got their own document to put

846
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
together which

847
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
i think the the one we wrote for black

848
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,080
hat was better i think it went into more

849
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,880
depth but

850
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
um it was neat to see kind of because at

851
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,679
the time there was nothing really to buy

852
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,240
so

853
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
perhaps someone bought medical

854
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
investment was just an mit license code

855
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,720
base and a domain name and that was

856
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
really it there was no

857
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,679
like assets really purchased so we ended

858
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,120
up going from you know

859
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
33 000 users at the time and no real

860
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
assets no real income outside of

861
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,039
training

862
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,320
to you know millions of dollars of

863
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
revenue on a commercial product but also

864
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,360
keeping the resource open

865
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,640
and that whole transition and all the

866
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,320
weird stuff we ran into it's a the paper

867
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
kind of covers a lot of the issues that

868
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,559
we ran into with like

869
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,720
uh companies kind of taking the software

870
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,000
and competing against us with it for a

871
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
while things like that

872
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
um i think the only main advice i have

873
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,640
these days is

874
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
the gpl is not your friend when it comes

875
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
to commercializing your own software

876
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
if you have any plans to commercialize

877
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
your software going forward do not use

878
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
the gpl find any other license stick

879
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,520
with mit bsd

880
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
something else or go commercial with

881
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
your license but don't use the gpl it's

882
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,360
just going to call you

883
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
like light years of pain cool

884
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,760
um all right well yeah i'll uh i'll link

885
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,480
