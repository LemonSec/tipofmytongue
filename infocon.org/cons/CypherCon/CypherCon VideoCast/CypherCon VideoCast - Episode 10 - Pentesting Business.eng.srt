yeah thanks thanks for joining me um so

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,120
i wanted to jump in right away and uh

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
get to get to know you a little bit get

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,239
to know about

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,279
um your company red siege so you

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
you founded this company can you talk a

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,720
little bit about uh you know that story

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,039
when

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
when did you uh start the company and

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,720
what was kind of the premise of

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
uh of starting it sure yeah i mean i

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
the security wasn't my sort of original

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
i don't know passion necessarily i mean

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,559
i didn't because i didn't know it was a

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,239
thing i watched sneakers like everybody

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,920
else i thought that was cool and then it

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,800
kind of

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,760
went dormant in the back of my mind for

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360
i don't know a long time ago now

23
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,760
however long ago that was so it started

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,399
off in

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,719
control systems of all things got into

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,600
uh

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
development hated that i liked it but i

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
don't like trying to chase down the bugs

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,320
and then into networking love that

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,039
but uh there's nothing more soul sucking

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,000
than trying to

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
figure out latency issues like it's

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
absolutely it's slow

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
what does that mean right and trying to

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
chase that down and i would

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,680
and that was a little bit cowboy like

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
hey we got a thing let's fix it

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
like we need to change control like

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,479
let's just take care of this

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
which was good most of the time

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,560
so i mean the nice thing with with being

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,079
offensive now

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,759
is we can make changes in production

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,040
right now of course we would don't want

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
to have any sort of negative impact

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
but uh it eventually just sort of got

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,799
into uh to security but i've pen tested

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,880
for uh well over a decade now i should

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
some point do that math

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,759
and i always had this itch like even

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
when i was sort of young that i always

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,320
wanted to

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
sort of start my own company or do

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
something like that

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,759
my dad has owned companies my uncles

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,119
have done companies so it's sort of just

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
an entrepreneurial thing that's kind of

58
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
in your blood huh in the blood right

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
so i'm like you know what at some point

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,639
i want to do this

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
so um gosh going on we're in our fourth

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
year now

64
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,959
i was like you know what i think it's i

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,920
think it's do or

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
do or do or die like at some point you

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,120
just gotta

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
kind of kind of gotta go for it and it

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,599
was an interesting experience

70
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,000
i asked john strain a dear friend of

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
mine

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,920
i'm like hey so uh what do you think

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,640
about do this

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
his first thing was well first off don't

75
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
no you're not gonna listen to me so

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
let's chat

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
so he he gave me all such a great uh

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,120
insight there on things to do and things

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
not to do

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
it's a lot of work um

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
a lot more work than kind of a thought

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
but the same time it's

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
super rewarding um it's sort of like

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840
your baby and you're just kind of

85
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
cultivating and growing this thing

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,400
and and um adding team members and

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
getting some of the the cool team

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,680
dynamics and

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
such that that has been tremendously fun

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
but it's also been hard like you know

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,519
small company you're the the person in

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,560
charge especially when you're really

93
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,200
small like

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
the vacation times are not like they

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
were before where you just

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
disappeared for a week or two right like

97
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,720
that's that's that's not

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,680
that's not a thing um so there's always

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,319
a little there's a little bit of

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
checking in it it's we're getting big

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,959
enough now where

102
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,799
we can kind of take a little bit of

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
extra step back i can take a little bit

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,000
extra step back because i've got some

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
people who can step up and take care of

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
a lot of that responsibility so that's

107
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
nice to finally start getting some of

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,159
that that that breath

109
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
get a breather in there um but

110
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
it's been a fantastic it's been a fun

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,879
experience yeah go ahead and for folks

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,599
that

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,200
that don't already know can you tell us

114
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
a little bit about what red siege does

115
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,239
sure yeah so um yeah company i founded

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,680
was red siege

117
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
we do all kinds of offensive things so

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,000
we do pen testing

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,840
that means network pen testing internals

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
externals

121
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
web pen testing mobile

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
red teams assumed breach and some purple

123
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,360
in there so

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
kind of all the offensive-ish or things

125
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
really closely related to uh to

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,478
offensive

127
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,600
uh security so we uh you know the

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
the the term i always people ask what do

129
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,400
you do like i'm a penetration tester

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,759
and then they giggle and you're like no

131
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,800
that's not a crappy pickup

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,639
i've heard all the jokes so you can skip

133
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
all those

134
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,880
right but it's we do all the the hacking

135
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,919
and it's it's

136
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,040
it's a lot of fun the technical

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
challenges are a lot of fun and then now

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
more recently the the business side is

139
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,560
is a tremendously enjoyable experience

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
so what made you what made you take that

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
leap of you know uh it sounded like you

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
were doing pen testing for

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
another company for a while and then

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
you're like you know what i'm gonna i'm

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,479
gonna

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,960
i'm gonna do this like what made you

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
kind of go all in

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
and say you know i'm gonna do this yeah

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
i mean i also teach for sans so the nice

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
thing like it wasn't just a jump off the

151
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,880
cliff

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,639
shift and hope you hope right because

153
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
i've got this this

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
really nice safety net of teaching for

155
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,440
sans even if like no clients come in

156
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,160
we're not going to be that off so that

157
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
was

158
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
something that i really needed to to

159
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
make that

160
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
i can't even call it a leap because it

161
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
was like maybe like a slightly larger

162
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
step because i'm not

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
you know going as far in and the risk is

164
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
significantly lower

165
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,160
but it was just something that i've

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
always wanted to do and it's been

167
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
something just nagging me saying look at

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,840
some point

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
you got to do this and i looked at you

170
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,199
know my age

171
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,199
where we were in the industry family i'm

172
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
like look it's

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
literally now or it's going to be too

174
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
late to to

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,160
to take that not leap but

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
that big step it is a big step right

177
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
yeah i mean because it's a whole

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
different thing the uh there's

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,840
no one in charge there's uh you know

180
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
especially when you start off by

181
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
yourself and you're solo there's no one

182
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,080
to say hey should we do this differently

183
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,199
because it's

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
well it's it's just it's just you so

185
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
you've gotta kind of learn things on

186
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
your own figure some of those things

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,520
out find other smart people who are

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
doing the same sorts of things and

189
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,039
and talk to other people um i think

190
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,479
where we've been successful so far

191
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
almost in spite of me because i just i

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,160
just i have a lot of smart

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,800
friends who i can ask and and and learn

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,759
from

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
and hopefully learn from their mistakes

196
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
learn from maybe from their missteps

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
um and that's so much more important

198
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
that's not just business that's just

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,919
frankly life yeah but it was just one of

200
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,280
those things that i always

201
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
wanted to do and it at the beginning it

202
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
was

203
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
more difficult than i thought because

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
now

205
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,960
everything is from scratch right like

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
you write a report there is no template

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
yeah you write the template

208
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
hey you got a finding cool every single

209
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
finding is a completely new finding like

210
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,000
you don't have

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
any of the basic like hey out of date

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
software there's no copy and pasting

213
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,479
from anything else

214
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,479
that is solely on you so it it

215
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,000
that that spool up the contracting like

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
what does it look the contracting

217
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
process look like what do those

218
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,960
documents look like

219
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,440
right like i wasn't fully aware of

220
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
necessarily

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
some of all i knew the process but i

222
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
didn't have some of the paperworks we

223
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,639
had

224
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
attorneys to talk to friends to talk to

225
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
to get things like the master service

226
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,599
agreements and

227
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
statements of work and get those all

228
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
fleshed out

229
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
and then you know every once in a while

230
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
things go a little bit sideways like

231
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,800
okay

232
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
time to update the contracts so that

233
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,000
this

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,800
doesn't happen again um so there's a

235
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
whole learning process and things are

236
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,240
starting to get a little bit smoother

237
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
now that we've knocked off a bunch of

238
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
those red rough edges with

239
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,039
you know not quite missteps but near

240
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,720
maybe near misses

241
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
and things like that and now we've got

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
some of those processes in place

243
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
and templates that we've got

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,800
uh some basic processes in place

245
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,039
you know if i if i come across old

246
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,160
software i can

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
i've got a template for that specific

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
finding it's not

249
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
right this whole bloody thing from

250
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
scratch so the reporting's a little bit

251
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,520
easier

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
still plenty of work there and still

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
nobody loves reporting but

254
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
you know a lot of you gotta do it gotta

255
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:32,958
do it

256
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
so um so when you called your friend and

257
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,000
you said hey i'm gonna start this

258
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
company and you said no

259
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,440
don't do it but here's some advice uh

260
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
did he give

261
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
what was what were some of the takeaways

262
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
was his advice good like now

263
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
you know four years later you're you're

264
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
you're doing it like did you

265
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
take some pieces from him that were like

266
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
oh yeah he was totally right on this or

267
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,959
maybe he wasn't right on on these things

268
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,720
or maybe it was completely different

269
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,519
experience than

270
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,760
you know the advice he gave you yeah i

271
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,320
mean it was

272
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
a lot i mean honestly i kind of forgot

273
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
what he said because it was a little bit

274
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
of a blur

275
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
so i used to go back all the time like

276
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,560
hey what's this what do you think about

277
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,680
this

278
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,519
um one of the the biggest

279
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,440
this this one was kind of a leap was

280
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
hiring the first person because now you

281
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,160
go from

282
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
hey it's just me right and if i sink

283
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
this ship i'm the only one on it

284
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
and i can figure out a way out right but

285
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
now i've got mike was the first

286
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
person on our team mike's now on the

287
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
team if this ship

288
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,440
sinks it's not just my family that goes

289
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
down i'm now taking somebody else

290
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,120
down with me and we keep adding more and

291
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
more people you're like man this

292
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,519
this bow's getting pretty heavy right

293
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
and um

294
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
sort of that process of bringing people

295
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
on board the most

296
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
miserable experience is i mean

297
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,519
given that we're a virtual company is

298
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
dealing with all of the different

299
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
states so like north dakota

300
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,320
has three there's north carolina one of

301
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
the two i forget if it's cory's and i

302
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
think it's kory state yeah north

303
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,000
carolina has

304
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
like three different ids that you have

305
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
to use in these different systems

306
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
and then like north dakota you can't you

307
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
have to get workman's comp

308
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
through the state of north dakota not

309
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,279
from someplace else but all these other

310
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
little tiny things are like oh my gosh

311
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,680
this just is soul sucking and it doesn't

312
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,279
help the business in any way shape or

313
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,760
form

314
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
right so how many different states are

315
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
you in

316
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,160
um texas florida

317
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,279
north carolina north dakota virginia

318
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
i think that's it yeah and then you got

319
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,399
to go and research like okay what are

320
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,680
the things i have to do in order to do

321
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
business in the state and that

322
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,240
that seems like a lot of a lot of time

323
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
sucks i i know i mean i had a startup

324
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
and i i went through all that stuff too

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,480
of like

326
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
okay what what filings do i gotta do

327
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
like what things like how do you set

328
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
this thing up

329
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
and and uh you know we were able to find

330
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,399
um

331
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,839
there was a thing called clerky that

332
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,440
kind of helped us with like you know

333
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
setting up the

334
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
because we did a c corp we we you know

335
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,399
went a little bit

336
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
because like the idea was that you know

337
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,519
in order to like we were going to want

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
to raise money at some point so in order

339
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
to raise money a lot of investors want

340
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,079
to see a c-corp but we're like

341
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,079
oh this is really complicated you need a

342
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
lawyer and all this and we were lucky

343
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
enough to find this clerky thing that

344
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
was

345
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,360
was like you know basically made it

346
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
really easy to incorporate in delaware

347
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,560
which is where all the startups

348
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
incorporate because it's the easiest

349
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
place to do it so

350
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
um but yeah it's it's it's there's all

351
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
these little things like that and uh

352
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
you know i was talking to a a friend of

353
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
mine who has

354
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
he has a business with uh he sells birds

355
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,399
like all different kinds of birds and he

356
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
was telling me about

357
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
you can have a black swan

358
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,839
or or you can't have a white swan you

359
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
can't have a white swan

360
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
you know but you can have a black swan

361
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
on it but not a white one you know like

362
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
just like all these like weird

363
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
rules in different states and all these

364
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
types of things and

365
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
yeah those are really difficult things

366
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,160
to

367
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
to navigate they they should make it a

368
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,519
lot easier well

369
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,720
yeah no because that was a thing that

370
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
i'm like i i

371
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
that i think that is the single most

372
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,160
surprising thing

373
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,480
was the difficulty working across

374
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,000
different states because i mean texas

375
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
was relatively easy

376
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
we don't have a a personal state income

377
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,519
tax

378
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
so there was no i had to set that up

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
right now plenty of other states do

380
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,639
which that one wasn't necessarily hard

381
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
but then there's unemployment insurance

382
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
and workman's comp and i thought

383
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
workman's comp people will work from

384
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
home i don't need workman's comp well

385
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
that worked well until they got fined by

386
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,839
the state of north dakota

387
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,360
for not having working with comp because

388
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
mike works from home

389
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
and i mean we eventually frankly just

390
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
relatively recently switched to a peo

391
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
where technically we're all employees of

392
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
this sort of intermediary that's owned

393
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
by

394
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
us and another company long story short

395
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
is they just handle all the payroll

396
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
stuff because okay it's an on-boarding

397
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
and it just makes my life i mean you pay

398
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,440
for it

399
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,920
but realistically it saves money because

400
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
of the time and then

401
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
healthcare and then you can focus on

402
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,079
what you do best

403
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,360
you know you don't have to worry about

404
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
that stuff so that was one of the best

405
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,120
pieces of advice that i got from john

406
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
and ann from other people he's like look

407
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,360
delegate

408
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
the stuff that you're not good at don't

409
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
try to save

410
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
10 bucks by trying to do something that

411
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
you absolutely hate

412
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
right or whatever the number is and i'm

413
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,360
like look managing all these various

414
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,079
states and

415
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
paying all this it's a pain in the butt

416
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,519
it doesn't it doesn't

417
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,360
help make the company better it doesn't

418
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,560
help with growth

419
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,839
it's a a speed bump let somebody else

420
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
take care of that so you know we pay a

421
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,279
little extra to have that peo take care

422
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
of it but

423
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
it's made my life a lot less stressful

424
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
and i can focus a lot more on the

425
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,360
business

426
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
focus a lot more on the technical side

427
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
as well

428
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
so if there's if there's pen testers out

429
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
there and they're listening to this and

430
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,839
they've been thinking about you know

431
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,199
like maybe i want to start a company um

432
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,519
you know and and they're kind of you

433
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,199
know but they're they're

434
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,040
they're comfortable in the position that

435
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
they're at at the company they're

436
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,519
working for

437
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
um you know what kind of advice would

438
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
you give to them and

439
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
to help them make the decision on

440
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
whether or not they they'd want to

441
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
um you know start their company is there

442
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,000
is there any kind of uh

443
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
advice you'd have to anyone like that

444
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,360
yeah i mean

445
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,399
the being the

446
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,720
sort of the traditional employee is nice

447
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,519
right i mean

448
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,040
you're technically you're beholden to

449
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
the company but the same time

450
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
you get vacation time you get days off

451
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
right

452
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
in some respects that that

453
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
ease also means that it's well the

454
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
responsibility shift is there a little

455
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,199
bit so

456
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
now if like if i especially back in the

457
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,120
the olden days

458
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,639
if i took vacation there's no paycheck

459
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
coming in right whereas if you've got a

460
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
day job you take some vacation like the

461
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,480
check

462
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
still comes in um you take that time off

463
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,079
and it

464
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,240
it's not there you don't take care of

465
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
all the little pieces there's no one to

466
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,519
necessarily kind of

467
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,839
fall back on right like i have plenty of

468
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,560
friends

469
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,040
who um started their own business and

470
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,920
then got behind on invoicing

471
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
i don't think it's fun but that's

472
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,600
literally the piece that brings in the

473
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,240
money

474
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
right so now like i i will jump on that

475
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,959
as quick as possible i don't enjoy it

476
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
but take that spoonful of medicine

477
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
because that's how i pay myself and

478
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,279
frankly everybody else right

479
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
the big thing is before you take that

480
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
leap

481
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,959
make sure you've got clients or have a

482
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,360
way to get some of the clients

483
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,399
right because i know i've known some

484
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,440
other people who are like hey let's try

485
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
this thing like and they're like how do

486
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
you find clients

487
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
you you needed to have some of that up

488
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,279
front right like that's not just this

489
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,399
thing where you're just like hey let's

490
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
go on the internet and google

491
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,839
clients and they show up um

492
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
google adwords yeah um again i

493
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,360
was fortunate enough to be in a place in

494
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
teaching with sans there's a little bit

495
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
of name recognition out there that helps

496
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
i had friends and i did some subcontract

497
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
we did some subcontracting work

498
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,079
this year i think we've done very very

499
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
little but that's definitely sort of a

500
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
transition as you oftentimes start off

501
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
doing a lot of subcontracting work and

502
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
then rolling into your own thing but the

503
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,320
subcontracting work i mean if if

504
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
you're the prime if their business goes

505
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,920
down guess what who's the first person

506
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,800
to go

507
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
and it's going to be the subcontractors

508
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
right i mean that's the whole purpose of

509
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,720
having

510
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,759
subcontractors is so that they can burst

511
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
so you know keep an eye on the economy

512
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
make sure you're not stepping into it i

513
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,279
wouldn't

514
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,560
suggest maybe starting it here quite yet

515
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,040
you know

516
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
we're at the end of 2020 at this point

517
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
2021

518
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
um could be a little bit of a downturn

519
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
but um

520
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,560
make sure another some other advice i

521
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
got both from

522
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,000
john from from ed scotus kevin johnson

523
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
and then other people

524
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,679
other people who own their own companies

525
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
is

526
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,439
keep some money in the bank where if

527
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,119
the company goes sideways for a couple

528
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,799
of months you can still

529
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,079
pay yourself pay everybody else so we we

530
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,640
sit on it fluctuates depending on the

531
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,599
time of year

532
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,199
three to six months of cash so that

533
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
literally if nothing comes in for the

534
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,799
next few months we still

535
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,600
pay the bills and it helps you keep

536
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,240
saying

537
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
the stress levels are you know sort of

538
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,039
gone like hey slow moth cool

539
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,640
but let's let's hunker down and i can

540
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,960
still sleep and i can still be refreshed

541
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,240
right even when it is a little bit

542
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,720
slower um a lot of people don't

543
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
like that because it's weird to look

544
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
over and be like you know that's a large

545
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
sum of money in that bank account

546
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
right like we but at the same time like

547
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
look this is

548
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,919
for the company that if things go

549
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
sideways

550
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,679
everybody's still getting paychecks and

551
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
it just is what it is

552
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,520
it's there and uh yeah

553
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
yeah well thank you for that that that

554
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,799
advice i think that's that's

555
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,440
some really good things to think about

556
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,080
if uh

557
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
if you are thinking about you know

558
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,200
making that leap like you want to make

559
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,960
sure that you

560
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,039
you know you do it right you know think

561
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
it through and understand

562
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
what the undertaking is um

563
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
and then i just kind of wanted to switch

564
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
gears a little bit and talk a little bit

565
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,240
about

566
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,360
what are the things that you've been

567
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
seeing over the last uh

568
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,640
few years and like how has your you know

569
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:34,960
pen

570
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,760
testing strategies uh evolved uh you

571
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,120
know over the last couple years what are

572
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
some of the things that you've

573
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
you've done um differently and what are

574
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
some of the kind of the new strategies

575
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
that you guys are employing

576
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
yeah i mean so a number of years ago i

577
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,080
mean

578
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,919
five six years ago the traditional sort

579
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
of pen test was

580
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,240
super common so we start with some sort

581
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,480
of internal access

582
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,760
if it's an internal pen test and

583
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
we go from there then there was kind of

584
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,799
a shift at least in

585
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
my experience maybe someone else has a

586
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
different experience but in my

587
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,880
experience

588
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
it was a big shift then to the red team

589
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
right so you have to fight to get that

590
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,400
initial access which is nice because it

591
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,640
more realistically represents what's

592
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
happening in the real world

593
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,440
um transition there but i'm

594
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
sort of seeing a transition from that

595
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
more into the assumed breach

596
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
the red team is a lot of fun but there's

597
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
a lot of

598
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
waiting so you have to craft a payload

599
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,240
and then convince somebody to click it

600
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
right you send send this email

601
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,360
and you're like well is this person on

602
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
vacation did they get caught by a spam

603
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,600
filter did they click it but then

604
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
not getting the connection back right

605
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
what exactly is going on and there's a

606
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
lot of sort of

607
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
in that time just waiting

608
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,000
and even if it goes relatively quickly

609
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
it still can take a lot of time to

610
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
develop those payloads to get the

611
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
evasions to get

612
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,760
whatever it may be so in my

613
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
more recent experience in fact i sort of

614
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
steer people away from red teams to some

615
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
extent

616
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
um more to the assumed breach we're like

617
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,159
look

618
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,360
let's just assume this thing hits right

619
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,799
at some point someone's gonna click on

620
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,320
it at some point you know

621
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,720
some bad guy malicious actor out there

622
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
is to develop a payload

623
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
and it's going to hit let's start from

624
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,720
there

625
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,240
right because because in the real world

626
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
that's what we're seeing we're seeing

627
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
fishing is the predominant way in we're

628
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,919
seeing a trusted insider

629
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120
as well right which realistically

630
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
is sort of the same for the assumed

631
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
breach right we're starting with

632
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
the access as a user whether it be

633
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,640
phished whether it be a malicious user

634
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,360
let's start from from that point and

635
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
then continue and we can save some of

636
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
the time

637
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,120
and therefore money of the fishing piece

638
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
up front and the payload development to

639
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,640
some degree

640
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
and i find it to be a little bit more

641
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
efficient and we could be a

642
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
lot quicker and more efficient and we

643
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
can find a lot of the same

644
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
sorts of things so we start with that

645
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,919
access

646
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,120
and i think one of the other big things

647
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
that we've seen over the years too

648
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
is it used to be that the cool thing to

649
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
do is to go for the

650
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
extreme privilege like hey i want in i

651
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
want to get domain admin i want to be

652
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,280
the king of the entire network and

653
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
it's sort of uh i mean i don't want to

654
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
say maturity but it's sort of a maturity

655
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,480
in a pen test life cycle as you become a

656
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,159
pen tester and move through it

657
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,240
like you know what that domain admin is

658
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,159
useful

659
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
but it's more of a cool trick at the end

660
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,640
because you can do a lot of the same

661
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,600
sort of thing

662
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
without necessarily having to to get

663
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,799
that

664
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,520
extreme permission those rights without

665
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,159
throughout the

666
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
entire organization you might land on

667
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,200
for example an engineering person's

668
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,400
computer and that person has access to

669
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,960
the intellectual property those drawings

670
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,559
well as an attacker the attacker no

671
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,919
longer needs to move they can just

672
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,120
simply

673
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,679
look and we see time and time again that

674
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
these file shares or whatever it might

675
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
be have

676
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,919
overly shared files where

677
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,679
anybody inside the organization right

678
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
steven accounting or sally and marketing

679
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
could just go to file share and be like

680
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
cool let's grab a bunch of this stuff

681
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
and now you have a breach right now

682
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
you're in the news have you lost

683
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
everything

684
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
absolutely not have you lost enough to

685
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,640
be in the news

686
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,760
yeah maybe right or have some sort of

687
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
negative impact or fines or something

688
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,720
like that so i think those are some of

689
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
the other

690
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
benefits to that sort of assumed breach

691
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,280
model

692
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,120
so when you do the assumed breach are

693
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
you still doing some of the

694
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,679
red teaming stuff as well or is it just

695
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,559
um you know you start out with uh kind

696
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,600
of

697
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
working backwards from there's a breach

698
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
how do we what do we do now type thing

699
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
or is it both

700
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
yeah we've had clients do both so we've

701
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,760
had some where hey let's start the

702
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
assumed breach but we want to be

703
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,039
quote very red meaning we want you to go

704
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,000
very low

705
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,039
and slow um so we'll we'll seed access

706
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,919
to this business

707
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
particular system we want to see kinder

708
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,360
defenders detect

709
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,960
as you move or as you exfiltrate um

710
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,000
or lateral movement

711
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
attempt to log in whatever it might be

712
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,840
those of course are going to take a

713
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,280
little bit longer because we want to be

714
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,600
much

715
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,959
more um

716
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,360
specific i can't think of the right word

717
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
uh much more much choosier on the exact

718
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
commands we use and when we do them and

719
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,760
how quickly we do them

720
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,559
whereas others we'll do them fast kind

721
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
of like the pen test

722
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
we're like look let's rip through this

723
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,080
to be as efficient as possible

724
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,400
in a gold and attempt to find a lot of

725
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,360
these high risk

726
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,600
findings um and deliver

727
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
the the report that shows that the

728
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
business risk i think that one of the

729
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,159
other big benefits

730
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
with the assumed breach versus the

731
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
internal pen test is

732
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
traditional internal pen test we set up

733
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
on the network and we start scanning the

734
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
network

735
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,360
at no point is the the attacker going to

736
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,480
be on the network

737
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,559
running you know scanners across the

738
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
network it's too it's too loud

739
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
right and oftentimes as we talked about

740
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
phishing or that trusted insider

741
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,240
they essentially start with access so

742
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,919
we're spending times a little bit more

743
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,480
misguided at least in my opinion with

744
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279
the sort of traditional test

745
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,320
gotcha um and is so i mean

746
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
is has there any been has there been

747
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,520
anything

748
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,559
uh new as far as uh attack

749
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,039
uh attackers like any ways in i mean you

750
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,080
mentioned fishing and

751
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,919
i think fishing has always been like the

752
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
number one way to get in

753
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
is you know tricking a user into

754
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,360
clicking something and then now they're

755
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
in right

756
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,960
um is there anything else that's like um

757
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,240
that's happened since

758
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,000
i don't know since covet or anything

759
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,159
that's uh that's newer out there that

760
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:56,880
you've

761
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,919
noticed over the last couple years sure

762
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,760
the cobit has changed things dramatic

763
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,960
dramatically because of the

764
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,080
the work from home many people were in

765
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,400
the office and now they moved to home

766
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600
which means remote access and

767
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,440
a lot of work some organizations had no

768
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,919
remote access or a minute minimal remote

769
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,880
access or

770
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,120
if they had it it didn't scale to the

771
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,679
degree that people needed

772
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
so you know the access mechanisms

773
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,080
weren't there the monitoring wasn't

774
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,360
there for these systems uh and we've

775
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,320
seen people just

776
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
like hey we've got this windows server

777
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,919
let's just set up remote desktop on the

778
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,039
internet

779
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,000
and we're seeing a lot of bad guys just

780
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,760
jumping on these windows systems with

781
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
remote desktop rdp

782
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
logging in you know try a couple of

783
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
credentials get in and then

784
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,240
game over uh vpn

785
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
a lot more vpn users right the average

786
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
person inside

787
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,080
maybe a company let's say a receptionist

788
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,559
or something

789
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
they don't need vpn access

790
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120
right and plenty of other people who

791
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,360
didn't need vpn access now

792
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,679
literally everybody does so there's like

793
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,880
a lot more uh

794
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
exposure there maybe some of those

795
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,559
systems like hey let's move this

796
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,880
to the cloud move it online and we don't

797
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
have the security set

798
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,720
and configured correctly and there's

799
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,159
additional exposure there so we're

800
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,080
seeing a lot of that and we saw of

801
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,039
course

802
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,880
a lot of the phishing emails around

803
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,159
covid

804
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,640
now that i have a personal opinion like

805
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,279
hey you know the

806
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
attackers are doing that but if i'm

807
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,880
doing a fishing exercise there's a

808
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
ethical and moral boundary where i'm

809
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
like you know what

810
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
using that for our fishing exercise

811
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
doesn't seem right right

812
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,600
where in my personal opinion do no harm

813
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
and if i'm causing someone to not take

814
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,880
the proper safety precautions

815
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
even though it's for the good of the

816
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
test it doesn't

817
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,320
sit well with me sure

818
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,679
yeah that's that's that's really

819
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,600
interesting people just spinning up the

820
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,279
remote desktops and

821
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
on the internet and huh i i guess so

822
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,200
yeah

823
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
i yeah i guess there is a lot more

824
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,799
exposure with more people connecting

825
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,679
from home is there is there easy things

826
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,320
that companies can do to mitigate this

827
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
or is i mean it kind of seems like you

828
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,440
have to

829
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,720
make sure you have a you know a a good

830
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,399
plan in place to make sure that you're

831
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,640
you're thinking about all these security

832
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,679
issues that

833
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,840
you know couldn't potentially happen

834
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,880
right yeah

835
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
and that's and that's the problem is

836
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,000
given time

837
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,440
people probably could have planned

838
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,679
better but it was literally like you

839
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,399
know a

840
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,679
thursday or whatever it was and they're

841
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,640
like boom tomorrow

842
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,279
we go online right and so there was no

843
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,559
time to plan

844
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,840
so it was get this thing in and then

845
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
we'll plan afterwards and they try to

846
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,279
shoehorn this stuff and then once it's

847
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,640
up

848
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,399
now trying to switch it to the right way

849
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,000
is more difficult

850
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,720
um and then another piece associated

851
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
with that too if i'm all of a sudden

852
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,440
setting up

853
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
additional vpn for people maybe

854
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,520
initially everyone had two factor

855
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,880
well now i've got a whole bunch of

856
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,559
people who didn't have vpn maybe they

857
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,640
don't have tokens for them

858
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,960
um they don't know how to use them they

859
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,159
they don't have it so

860
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,960
we've got you know maybe step back in

861
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
security as we start to distribute some

862
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,240
of those extra

863
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,760
tokens to people so it was a

864
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
interesting change it was it was kind of

865
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,960
beautiful though to see

866
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
some of the adaptation by people to to

867
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,120
get ready

868
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,039
but at the same time i mean it it was

869
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,840
it's brutal right people are still

870
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,279
getting their sea legs in this whole

871
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
thing trying to still get

872
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,080
you know remote and cloud and whatever

873
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,279
it might be

874
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,120
set up to service their users and their

875
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
customers yeah no

876
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
it's been really interesting i know um

877
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
my wife was telling me like it would

878
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,960
have taken

879
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,080
she's like it would have taken our

880
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
company like four years to figure out

881
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,919
how to do remote stuff but we had to

882
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,279
figure out how to do it in a week

883
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
you know like so people had to adapt

884
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,919
quickly and they had to and

885
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,520
and as a result sometimes there are

886
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,919
those those missteps you don't you can't

887
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,679
think of everything right so it's you

888
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,159
know

889
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,840
you you do what you can with what you

890
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
got and uh

891
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,000
but you know now that uh we kind of

892
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,919
ripped the band-aid off now is the time

893
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,440
to make sure you go back and

894
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,039
you know dot your eyes and cross your

895
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,480
keys and all that right well it's some

896
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,760
of the other interesting pieces there

897
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
too like i saw a bunch of stuff

898
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,279
i think a little bit less so these days

899
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
but i had companies asking me like well

900
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,720
how do you keep an eye on your employees

901
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,679
to make sure they're getting their work

902
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,720
done

903
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,559
and they wanted essentially spyware

904
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,200
on the systems to make sure like some

905
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,559
some i heard about would like to

906
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,559
look at your the webcam or the camera on

907
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,080
the laptop and see if somebody's sitting

908
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
behind the desk

909
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,960
and you know there's much

910
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
deeper issues than the security issues

911
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,159
right

912
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,919
and sort of my model i mean we've been

913
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,360
virtual since

914
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,520
the company started and i've been remote

915
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
for um

916
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
gosh a decade now and it's a different

917
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
management style it's a different work

918
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
style and you have to look at look are

919
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,200
they

920
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,279
is there output there's no output

921
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,559
they're not doing their work

922
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,120
right exactly other people are like is

923
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
your butt in the desk

924
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,640
i don't care if your butt's in the desk

925
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,080
if you're getting if you're getting

926
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,279
your job done in a timely fashion

927
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,360
i don't care if you have your butt in

928
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
the desk

929
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,240
right and um when people sort of move to

930
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,880
that

931
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,159
that model it's a little bit different

932
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,679
like i got one of my guys who loves to

933
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,679
go hunting and fishing and go for walks

934
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,320
and he'll

935
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,000
you know middle of the day pop smoke but

936
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
then he'll work in the evening or

937
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,919
whatever just just because that's what

938
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
he loves to do another guy who likes to

939
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,399
travel

940
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,919
um maybe in the the after times he'll

941
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
pop into you know random country and do

942
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,440
some work from there because

943
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,279
it doesn't matter like just just get the

944
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,880
work done but we see a lot of those sort

945
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,600
of

946
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,399
old ideas of i can stick my head out of

947
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,320
my office and gaze upon the people in

948
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,919
the cube farm and if they're there

949
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,519
they're working it or not

950
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,450
then of course the people side too

951
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,799
[Music]

952
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,159
at least for me i remember when i

953
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
switched to work from home

954
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
i had a horrible time three the first

955
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,919
three months was

956
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,720
miserable i didn't know how to split

957
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,519
work

958
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,279
from life i i was always

959
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,799
i mean i'd be at my desk and like hey

960
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,000
you know i can finish this later because

961
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
i work from home and i'd be on google

962
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,919
and then later like i would take my

963
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,440
laptop's living room cause i'm like hey

964
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,799
i'm watching this but i need to get some

965
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,440
work done

966
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
i was like working all the time but

967
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,039
getting less done

968
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,440
and it was just it was it was miserable

969
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
until i

970
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
learned to set some of those boundaries

971
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
and adapt there

972
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
right so it's it's been interesting

973
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,600
that's for sure

974
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
yeah it definitely has been an

975
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
interesting time and we've all had to

976
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,240
deal with it and adapt and

977
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
and yeah so we'll we'll we'll see what

978
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,919
happens and

979
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,320
how much of this will carry over until

980
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,919
you know after there's a vaccine

981
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,399
and and how much you know remote stuff

982
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,440
will probably

983
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,799
i mean a lot of people i think are

984
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,559
finding that you know

985
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
some of it's working you know and so i

986
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,919
think a lot of it will stick around

987
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,559
and um but it'll be interesting to see

988
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,000
how this kind of changes

989
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,559
uh our work styles and and all that kind

990
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,440
of stuff

991
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,799
well i'm wondering that too because i

992
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,320
think that's going to be fascinating to

993
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,919
see like i wish i would have thought

994
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:16,399
about it

995
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,679
months ago and invested in like uh

996
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,120
i don't know what you're calling but re

997
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,880
remote workplace

998
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,399
right like the the place where a bunch

999
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:25,760
of people can come like you grab your

1000
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
laptop you show up at this place they

1001
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,679
got the cube and desks and chairs and

1002
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,360
coffee place and you could work there

1003
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,200
and simulate

1004
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,440
the office because i think as you said

1005
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,640
you're going to see a lot more of that

1006
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,080
we're seeing sort of this

1007
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
migration from expensive areas of the

1008
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
country to quite literally anywhere

1009
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,840
else yeah right and i think that's going

1010
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,559
to be an

1011
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
interesting transition i'm kind of

1012
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
curious how that

1013
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,320
kind of plays out long term i mean it

1014
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,120
was

1015
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,799
i expected that to happen at some point

1016
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
but this is definitely a fast forward

1017
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,919
button like hey

1018
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,519
we're making this change now and i don't

1019
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,960
know if we ever go back

1020
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,120
right right yeah it's uh yeah it's

1021
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,880
definitely accelerated the way that

1022
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,279
we've

1023
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,600
uh yeah i think i saw i heard like um

1024
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
i thought this was an interesting thing

1025
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
that uh and

1026
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,200
it was i think the ceo of airbnb he was

1027
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,000
talking about

1028
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,720
how he thinks in in the future people

1029
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,279
will

1030
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,279
spend you know their work on their

1031
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
screens but do their leisure time

1032
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,600
away from screens and doing more travel

1033
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,039
and stuff because everyone just like

1034
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,720
works on a computer all day and

1035
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,399
there'll be less people watch you know

1036
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,840
less watching tv

1037
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,640
and netflix and stuff and and more

1038
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
getting out and doing stuff it's kind of

1039
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,640
flipped so you go to

1040
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,440
leisure and you you know come home to

1041
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,039
work kind of thing and i was like huh

1042
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,679
that's a

1043
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,159
that's an interesting flip-flop of of

1044
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,000
you know the way that we do things you

1045
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,360
get home from work and you turn on the

1046
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,000
tv versus like i've been looking at a tv

1047
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,240
all day i need to get away you know i

1048
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,440
thought about that aspect yeah yeah

1049
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,399
that's interesting

1050
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,840
i mean one of the things like for me was

1051
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,480
switching to the to the remote

1052
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,720
is after i finally developed some

1053
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,159
boundaries like

1054
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,600
we could go on this was still

1055
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,879
you know still well actually that was a

1056
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,719
long time ago but like even starting the

1057
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
company

1058
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,399
um you know it takes a lot of work to

1059
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,918
get this thing going but we could go

1060
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,199
places and afterwards i'm in bed like

1061
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,879
hey let me crank out this report real

1062
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,520
quick

1063
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,599
and then let's go to the beach during

1064
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,639
the day

1065
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,560
um and then everyone's taking a nap in

1066
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,679
the afternoon

1067
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,879
let me get through a couple of these

1068
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,719
things so i mean i wasn't working

1069
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,159
full-time but i was still able to get

1070
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,879
some of those

1071
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,000
sort of things done other times like

1072
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
we've gone to travel to go see family

1073
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,359
and i didn't take

1074
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
this was before when i had the the quote

1075
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
normal day job and not my own thing like

1076
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,239
i would just

1077
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,359
work during the day because the kids

1078
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,359
would play outside and my

1079
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,918
like my brother or dad or whoever was

1080
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,839
working we'd hang out in the evening

1081
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,440
so it gave me more flexibility to to

1082
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,000
i don't know see and travel and do

1083
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,160
things but not necessarily take

1084
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,839
vacation if you will right i mean

1085
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,440
there's there's a there's an extreme

1086
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,960
danger there where you can cross that

1087
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,680
line and

1088
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,920
never take vacation don't do that i've

1089
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
been there

1090
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,480
uh but it does give you exactly like

1091
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,079
that like let's

1092
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,720
jason on my team he'll go to thailand

1093
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,440
and

1094
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,960
box and then but then get his work done

1095
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,480
at night so yeah yeah it's

1096
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
yeah it'll be interesting to see what

1097
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760

1098
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,880
