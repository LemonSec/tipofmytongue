meditation as a new age way to relax

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
but it's it's way more than that it goes

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
a lot deeper and uh meditation

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,320

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
introduction

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
so i thought maybe a good place to start

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
um you know you you had a

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
plan on doing a presentation at

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,640
cyphercon

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
called uh brain hacking train your brain

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,840
for

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
love joy and peace and i thought maybe

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,239
that'd be a good place to start

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,640
and talk about you know what you were

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,080
going to talk about in that presentation

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,800
before we

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
you know it got canceled did covet and

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
everything and i was wondering if you

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
could talk about it in the context

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
of what we're seeing in the world right

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
now i mean obviously

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
we've kind of been uh hit with

78
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,599
a lot of unprecedented unprecedented

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,480
things right now

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
um covet obviously uh for one

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
um you know we are changing the way that

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,200
we live every single day because

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,560
of the pandemic and also

84
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
the um what we're seeing right now

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
worldwide

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
as far as protests and inequality and

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
i'm wondering if

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
you could talk about you know training

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
your brain for love in in

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,440
in what we're seeing right now so um

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
yeah can you just tell us a little bit

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,920
about what your talk is and in the

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,200
context of what we're seeing in the

94
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,239
world today

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
excellent thanks kyle and so yeah

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,239
let's first talk about what uh jen

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,120
darren and i

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
jen darren and i we are cyber security

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
analysts and

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,760
you know cyber security professionals

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
and we have a deep interest in

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,000
understanding the human psyche and we

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
had a whole bunch of tools that we were

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
going to demonstrate

105
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,239
so the thing is you know meditation is

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
is shown like this exotic thing right

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
where

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
it's an exotic art from asia or

109
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,400
something like that

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
the basic meditation skills are are very

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,400
aminable every any we can we can train

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
anybody on that so

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
you know think of the human brain like a

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
super computer and i'll talk more about

115
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,360
that

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,799
but it's love joy and peace we can train

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
our mind to get there

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
and the reality of life is it is a very

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,879
hard life

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,599
okay a lot of the challenges that we

121
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,879
face

122
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,600
are difficult problems to solve they're

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
not easy

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
and sure enough you can't just meditate

125
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
these problems away

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
but here's what meditation does for us

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,479
it

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,080
helps us reach in a state where we

129
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
can realize how we

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,880
are unique in our abilities

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,680
but we are very very similar right the

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
heart that beats in you

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
is very identical to the heart that

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
beats inside me

135
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
your brain is very similar to my brain

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
you

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,280
have a lot of challenges in your life

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
and the way you react and respond may be

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,919
slightly different from the way i would

140
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,360
respond and react

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
but we are all in it together does that

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,720
make sense

143
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,680
yeah absolutely so that's where we are

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
so

145
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,120
today what i wanted to do is i wanted to

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
show how

147
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
the brain right the brain has evolved

148
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
the human brain has evolved

149
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
over 1.5 million years the

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
from the ape brain to the human brain

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
right

152
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
and the past 300 000 years we've been

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,720
homo sapiens right

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
our brain has developed uniquely

155
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
and till 10 000 years ago

156
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
we were hunters and gatherers so brain

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,840
is designed for that it's designed for

158
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,360
survival it is designed for

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
thinking and all that and so we have a

160
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
lot of programs

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,080
in our brain that are related to

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,280
anger fear etc

163
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,039
and the thing is we have to be careful

164
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,560
to realize that

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
that's not that's not we don't

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
necessarily have to be in that default

167
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,360
state all the time

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
and so that's we're going to talk about

169
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,199
that

170
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
and we're going to show some simple

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,560
devices

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,520
how to get to that state and so today i

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,880
wanted to give you some

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
samples of that demonstration without

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
the devices of course

176
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
and and give some exercises

177
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
and hopefully if you are listening to

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
this podcast while you are driving

179
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,400
uh don't do the exercises uh while

180
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
driving

181
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
my request is that sort of safe thing to

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,280
do even if you keep your eyes open

183
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,560
because it will take you to a different

184
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,199
state

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,000
but definitely listen to those exercises

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
uh when you

187
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
pull your car in a parking lot in a safe

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
place or

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
at home does that make sense kyle yes

190
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,680
and yeah

191
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,759
very important disclaimer do not

192
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
meditate while driving

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
excellent so what i'm going to do is i

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,960
want to show

195
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
you know how the brain is so

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
uh would you mind doing an experiment

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,680
with me sure let's do it

198
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,240
okay so sit comfortably feet flat on the

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,440
ground

200
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
and keep your eyes open and

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
describe to the people who are listening

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
to us on the radio what you see on the

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
screen

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
so we have a solar system um we see

205
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
you know we have the sun way on the left

206
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,840
and then we have

207
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,479
mercury venus earth mars relatively

208
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,039
close

209
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,240
close to the sun then you have the

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
asteroid belt jupiter saturn

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,919
and uranus neptune pluto all spread out

212
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,680
quite a bit more with pluto being way on

213
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,000
the right

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,960
side of the screen excellent so until

215
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
unless you're an astronomy buff right

216
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,560
most of us are used to these almost cons

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
concentric circles of all the planets

218
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,000
right yep and i'm going to show you two

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
things right i'm going to show you

220
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
focus and awareness

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
right so you're going to be focused on

222
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
this so

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
imagine you're going to sit on the sun

224
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
and then be aware of that breath right

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
as you're breathing

226
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
you're standing on the sun okay

227
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
and the first jump you're going to make

228
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,319
is one astronomical unit

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
that means you will get to earth from

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,479
the sun

231
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,680
and that's about 150 million kilometers

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,639
okay

233
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,919
approximately and so it will take you

234
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,720
eight minutes to go from the sun to the

235
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
earth

236
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,039
so visualize you making that jump in

237
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
eight minutes

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,359
and then coming back

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
are you back in the sun yes okay

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
now be aware of the breadth going in and

241
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,240
out and

242
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
be aware of the gap between you and the

243
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
screen

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
okay now

245
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
mars takes about 12 minutes so mars

246
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
venus works they're all in about 12

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
minutes right

248
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,880
the next jump to jupiter

249
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
is 43 minutes so visualize going from

250
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
the sun

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,200
to jupiter 43 minutes

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,920
and then coming back and jupiter i call

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
the godfather

254
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,000
or the bully of the solar system it's

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,519
one of the largest

256
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
it's all the planets put together twice

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,839
of that or something like that it's a

258
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:28,560
huge

259
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
uh planet so

260
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,000
that takes 43 minutes

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
now go go back from the sun now we're

262
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
going to jump into saturn

263
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
now it's nearly double the distance 1

264
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,640
hour and 20 minutes

265
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,600
9.6 a.u

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
are you able to visualize in your head

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
that the

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,920
vast distances between these planets

269
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,360
uh i'm able to extrapolate

270
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
and and think what it would be like but

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
i i don't know if i really have

272
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,760
a real grasp on what that means you know

273
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
okay

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
so so it literally means like right

275
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
if you were to just take you 43 minutes

276
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,000
to drive

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
from milwaukee to the border of

278
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,560
chicago right

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
uh the the border of wisconsin and

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,760
milwaukee was not about a 45 minute

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,360
drive right that's roughly 10 minutes

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
right

283
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
so to get to downtown it's probably

284
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
going to take you one and a half hours

285
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,600
from where you are

286
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
right so that's the distance of saturn

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
right then let's go to uranus you're

288
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
jumping from the sun to uranus

289
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,120
and that's double the distance 2.4 hours

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,720
right 2 hours and 40 minutes

291
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
then you go back to the sun and now you

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,640
make the next chance to neptune

293
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
and remember in your mind you can see

294
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
that your brain is making those

295
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
calculations

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
and you you see yourself visually going

297
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,399
do you see that

298
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
jump that you're making to neptune and

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
coming back visually in your my head yes

300
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,680
yes and i i'm passing all the other uh

301
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
planets planets as you're doing that

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
right yeah theoretically they'll not be

303
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
all of the straight line but

304
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
right and then look at the distance to

305
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,040
pluto

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,760
right it takes 5 hours and 20 minutes

307
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
so if you are in milwaukee imagine

308
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,399
driving driving and within like within 8

309
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,160
minutes you reached earth right

310
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
but it takes you 5 hours and 28 minutes

311
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,518
to reach pluto

312
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,519
and so there are two things i want to

313
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
show you one is i was focusing on the

314
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
planets right

315
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
but i hope you are also aware that your

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,839
brain is doing all these calculations

317
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,000
um and what about the feelings were you

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
relaxed when you were going through this

319
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
were you curious what were the feelings

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
that were going through when i did this

321
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
exercise

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,000
um yeah i mean i guess i was relaxed i

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,800
was um what's the right word for it um

324
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,480
maybe you know i was

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
trying to visualize and you know go

326
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,760
through and and listen to your

327
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,079
directions so i guess i was

328
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,839
um thinking about about the planets and

329
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,279
and trying to

330
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
do it and i'm trying to think about what

331
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
feeling is associated with that um

332
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,079
maybe a little bit of uh anxiety

333
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,519
because i'm not a great uh visualizer

334
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,000
so so i have i have that going for me

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,839
maybe

336
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,440
okay so yeah but very very able to

337
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
visualize driving to the border of

338
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,000
wisconsin

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
yeah yeah that's something that i can um

340
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,120
yeah i can

341
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
i i i've done that many times so i know

342
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
that one right

343
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
and so there also was a curiosity saying

344
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,160
where the hell is dr k going with that

345
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,800
yes there's this head here

346
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,600
so here's the thing we all are endowed

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
with a super brain

348
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
okay and here's what makes our brains so

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
amazing

350
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,760
right in the 1.5 million years of the

351
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,000
brain development

352
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,399
we have three skills that we developed

353
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,040
okay

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
one was the use of hands and make tools

355
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
because we were apes that could stand on

356
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
two feet right so we had two hands free

357
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,440
so we could throw objects and then we

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
could make tools with our hands

359
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
right the second thing was the social

360
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,639
brain

361
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
the fact that we deal with social people

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
and the third part of the brain is the

363
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
language skills

364
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
right so we have a super computer in our

365
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,240
head

366
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
and there's a part of the brain called

367
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,279
the prefrontal cortex that's

368
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
developed that's compared to all the

369
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,600
other apes ours is the largest

370
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
and what the prefrontal cortex does is

371
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,959
it kind of

372
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,680
figures out a lot of the planning for

373
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,320
the future etc happens

374
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,160
so here's the problem the default option

375
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
for our brain is

376
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
regrets and worries why because we

377
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
in the prefrontal cortex you know i can

378
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,639
ask you to say hey do you remember the

379
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,320
last time you goofed up

380
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
i'm willing to bet you your mind would

381
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
be able to remember

382
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
when you made a mistake last right and

383
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
that's the part of the brain that it

384
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
estimates that so we play a lot of time

385
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
regrets and worries those are the

386
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
default programs

387
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
hide and react to strong feelings

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
what do i mean by that let's assume you

389
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,639
have a boss or somebody who's very

390
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,160
important to you and you get very angry

391
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,199
with them

392
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
you don't yell back at them why don't

393
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,639
you yell back at them

394
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
kyle because you know it's inappropriate

395
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,519
you don't want to get fired

396
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
right you don't want to get fired right

397
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,800
so there's a brain part of your brain

398
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,480
that doesn't want to deal with that

399
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,079
but guess what those feelings are deep

400
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,160
inside then there's an overactive inner

401
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,639
critic

402
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,760
and these are the most common uh

403
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
programs that we keep running and they

404
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
are default they're basically default

405
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
and you can see where this is going now

406
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,079
i'm not saying these things are bad

407
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,399
right

408
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
sometimes you have to hide your strong

409
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
feelings sometimes you have to react to

410
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,518
your strong feelings

411
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
and whole idea about meditation and

412
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
mindfulness is

413
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,000
if you could start becoming aware of the

414
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,079
program that you're running

415
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,680
you're likely to respond better to it

416
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
yeah that makes sense yeah definitely

417
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
and that's something that i've noticed

418
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,440
you know with with my practice and yeah

419
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,959
so tell me tell me more i was curious

420
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,399
about that how did he get started

421
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,519
meditating and

422
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,480
tell us a little bit more about how that

423
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,519
came about

424
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
yeah i i i started probably about five

425
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,600
years ago

426
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,759
and i i was interested in it i started

427
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,279
hearing about it from

428
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,360
uh different people podcasts and stuff

429
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,720
like that and i thought

430
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,279
and i heard about um headspace and

431
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,040
headspace is an app that

432
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
got me into it and what got me into it

433
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
is it was this take

434
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,120
10 for 10 challenge and it was 10

435
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
minutes a day for 10 days

436
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,040
and if it didn't change your life

437
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
they're like well then don't buy the app

438
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,199
but if

439
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
you are finding a significant difference

440
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,519
like you can continue to do this and

441
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,040
really build on your practice and so i

442
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
did it for 10 days i'm like i might as

443
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,240
well just try this out i'll try this out

444
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
i'll try it

445
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
and uh so i did you know 10 minutes and

446
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,120
headspace does a really good job of

447
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,079
explaining meditation

448
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,759
and how to meditate and like kind of

449
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,680
basically watch your thoughts

450
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,399
um as you are focusing on your breath

451
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
but like don't try to interact with your

452
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,199
thoughts just notice some kind of a

453
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,560
thing and so

454
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,759
um so so i did that and what i noticed

455
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,720
uh

456
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,160
the biggest thing i noticed right away

457
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,079
is i was just a lot more calm

458
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
and i reacted to things a lot

459
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
differently um you know i wouldn't get

460
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,399
upset

461
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,560
as much if something if someone did

462
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,600
something that

463
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,519
you know normally would have triggered

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,199
me and i'd you know get upset with

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,640
someone for doing something stupid at

466
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
work or something like that and i was

467
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,959
just like

468
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,439
i can't control that but i can control

469
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
the way that i react to that

470
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,039
and that was a big aha moment for me is

471
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,039
getting that awareness and being able to

472
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
be aware in in all

473
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,799
aspects of you know my life and uh

474
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,240
so yeah that's that's what really worked

475
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
great for me um

476
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
what about what about you how did you

477
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
get into it so that's a good

478
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,320
question so when i was uh 16 years old i

479
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,360
was in high school

480
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
and we had mandatory yoga and you know

481
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,919
mandatory yoga

482
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
for a teenager anything mandatory for a

483
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,200
teenager

484
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
means we are not going to follow it

485
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
right and when we started doing the yoga

486
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
i saw all my friends could sit

487
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
cross-legged and they could turn

488
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
themselves into pretzels and i could

489
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,960
barely

490
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,919
sit properly right so i hated the yoga

491
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,720
class i hated the yoga teacher

492
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
one fine day at the end of the yoga

493
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,200
class he did something called shavasana

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,720
shavasana is basically literally the

495
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,799
dead body post

496
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,000
so the instructor made us uh

497
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,520
lie down flat on the ground

498
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,039
and then he made us imagine

499
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,200
you know he walked us through the basic

500
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
stuff right

501
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
focus on your breath focus on your body

502
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,080
relax the body

503
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
all that then he took us to a

504
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
visualization exercise

505
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,919
he made us imagine that we were in a

506
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,039
valley

507
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
with a river running through it very

508
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,360
calm very relaxing

509
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,679
and here's what he did that was crazy at

510
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,480
that moment

511
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
right he imagined that there's a funeral

512
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
pyre

513
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
you know in india we don't bury bodies

514
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
right we cremate bodies

515
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,440
so imagine a funeral pyre and he put our

516
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
bodies there

517
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,760
and said your physical body no longer

518
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
exists there's only spirit

519
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
and that spirit fills the entire valley

520
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,280
and kyle that really i can still i get

521
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
goosebumps even now

522
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
that it's been 30 40 years since i did

523
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
that and i still get the goosebumps in

524
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,080
my in my

525
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,919
body and it was the sense of peace

526
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,440
and relaxation and like any teenager

527
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
right i thought that was a cool

528
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,600
experience filed it

529
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
and forgot about it and then 15 20 years

530
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
later i was in

531
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
university of virginia doing my phd as

532
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
you know phds can be

533
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
a doctorate can be very very stressful

534
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
and i was in a stage where i was totally

535
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
stressed out about it

536
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
and at that time john kabadzin this is

537
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,919
the guy is the

538
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
god of mindfulness and i read his book

539
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,679
um and i i'll put that book in the

540
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,720
reference section

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,120
and literally changed my life i started

542
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,280
practicing meditation again

543
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,640
um i finished my phd within you know a

544
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,960
few months and i'm not saying

545
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
the meditation was the only thing that

546
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
helped me but you know

547
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
it helped me put in a resourceful state

548
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,919
right and i did

549
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,039
the phd and then um then you know it

550
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,520
became a regular part of my life

551
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,919
does that answer your question yeah no

552
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,280
that's that's interesting about the

553
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
visualization uh

554
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,919
meditation that you went through and it

555
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,039
had that profound

556
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,120
effect on you you know and was that your

557
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
first time experimenting with meditation

558
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
that was really the first time i had no

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
clue what meditation was and then of

560
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
course you know when i was in my mid-20s

561
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,000
then

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
i went back to the practice and of

563
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,039
course there's so many

564
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,960
techniques now you know there's so many

565
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,679
tools but visualization is definitely

566
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,080
one powerful tool where you can you know

567
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
and i liked what you mentioned earlier

568
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
you mentioned that you know you can't

569
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
meditate your problems away

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
and i was wondering if you could speak a

571
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
little bit more to that because i think

572
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,799
people think that okay i'm gonna

573
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,159
meditate and and

574
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,679
and things are gonna go away i'm gonna

575
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,200
feel way better

576
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,840
and it's it's not been my experience

577
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
that that's the case but through this

578
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,400
practice

579
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
i'm able to uh be more aware

580
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,640
of what i'm feeling in this moment and

581
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,280
then

582
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
be better able to react and i'm not

583
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
perfect by any means i

584
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,440
actually i remember i just had a i

585
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,919
remember

586
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,520
we were talking a couple weeks ago and

587
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
like soon after that my wife and i got

588
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,480
in a fight and i'm like

589
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
i'm not like because i was telling you

590
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
i'm like yeah this has really changed my

591
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,559
life and i'm just like

592
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
you know i don't want to feel this way

593
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,600
and so

594
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
we were able to talk it out but you know

595
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
it was it's

596
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
um it's it's a practice right so it's

597
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,080
like a constant

598
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,360
it's it's a wise man who says hey listen

599
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
you know i may be at fault here let me

600
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
take that step back

601
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,760
right that's definitely a challenge

602
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,440
that's definitely a challenge

603
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
well i think it's great so let me let me

604
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,080
share my model right my favorite model

605
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,360
uh can you see my screen yeah okay

606
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,559
so for those people who are uh

607
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,400
not watching that i'm basically

608
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,559
comparing ethical hacking

609
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
with brain hacking 101 right

610
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
so what is ethical hacking for those of

611
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
you i'm sure there's going to be some of

612
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
my students who listen to this and who

613
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
may not know cyber security

614
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,679
but ethical hacking is when you as the

615
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,120
good guy

616
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
hack a system to find the flaws right

617
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
and there are four or five steps the

618
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
reconnaissance where

619
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
uh you go ahead and check out the system

620
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,320
right you walk around the building um

621
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,919
you know you check the website there a

622
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
lot of tools available

623
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,880
that you check out for some areas where

624
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,320
there are vulnerabilities

625
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,520
right for example in a window you're

626
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,000
going around

627
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
the window and you see you're going

628
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,039
around the building and you see some

629
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,039
open windows or open doors unlocked

630
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,200
doors right that's a typical thing

631
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,919
scanning is very specific that means you

632
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,799
are now

633
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
trying to get into the system right and

634
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
so there are a lot of tools available

635
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,760
we look for open ports and there are a

636
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
whole bunch of tools available there

637
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,640
and then once and we gain access right

638
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,520
gaining access

639
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
is very straightforward at all it's not

640
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
straightforward but there are many ways

641
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
to get into it

642
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
in some cases you send us

643
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,799
you send a email and then somebody

644
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,320
clicks on the wrong link and then they

645
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,679
give you access to it

646
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
or you find the username and password

647
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,200
and things like that so a number of ways

648
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
maintaining access is different you once

649
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
you get in there you get in as a user

650
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
you escalate privileges or you

651
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
go into multiple accounts and then

652
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,840
you've got free access to the system and

653
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,400
the

654
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
last part of it is reporting so then you

655
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
write a formal report saying hey these

656
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,159
are the common flaws i found

657
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,919
and then we talk about mitigation and

658
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
transformation so any organization

659
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,159
a good that has a good cyber security

660
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,120
program

661
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,799
has a good ethical hacking that means

662
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,240
these are the good guys

663
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,159
uh kyle is that a good explanation of

664
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,600
ethical hacking

665
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
yeah i really yeah yeah and i like this

666
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,200
analogy between ethical hacking and

667
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
brain hacking

668
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,880
yeah right so in brain hacking right the

669
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
first part of it is awareness

670
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
right so for example you were able to

671
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
see that you were thinking that right

672
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,440
and then you are aware

673
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
of the visualization and things like

674
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,520
that right you are

675
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
most of the time we are totally we mix

676
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,840
up our awareness and thinking

677
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,000
and we need to be able to separate that

678
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
so when you are having

679
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
a fight with your spouse you know you

680
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,279
are able to take that step back and said

681
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:31,600
hey

682
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
you know i'm losing my control there

683
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,360
does that make sense

684
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
and i tell the difference right when

685
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
people say i'm sad

686
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
i say take a step back and say

687
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
i'm feeling sad right so there's a

688
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,360
difference between

689
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
i'm sad as the identity is sadness but

690
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
i'm feeling sad is that awareness that

691
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,080
you're feeling sad does that

692
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
is that a good example of awareness kyle

693
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,720
yeah i think so yeah i think it's

694
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,520
yeah it's you know figuring out where

695
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
you're at and then finding it and i know

696
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,600
a lot

697
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
especially for uh you know for men it's

698
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,679
hard to

699
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,960
really like be able to like identify

700
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,600
those feelings sometimes right so it

701
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
takes practice

702
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
the second part is mindfulness right and

703
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,440
mindfulness

704
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,520
is this awareness but it comes

705
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
with no judgment you're aware of it

706
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
and you're saying oh there's this

707
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,960
acknowledgement

708
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
i'm going through a tough time or i'm

709
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,000
going through this feeling

710
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,200
right you're able to

711
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,440
uh not judge yourself you're not saying

712
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
i'm a stupid idiot for not being able to

713
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,000
control

714
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,159
my anger or i'm feeling angry and i

715
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,679
shouldn't feel angry that's not the deal

716
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:46,400
you're just

717
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
observing ah you know dr k is feeling

718
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,200
that pain or he is

719
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
feeling sad the next part is gaining

720
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,600
access

721
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
love joy and peace and hopefully right

722
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,120

we'll do some short meditation sessions

726
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
but the next level is the equivalent of

727
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
maintaining access right

728
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,960
is cultivating core and this is

729
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
connection optimism resilience

730
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,279
and i'll tell you talk to you more about

731
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,360
that but this is like

you there are number of tools that are

733
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,640
available right

734
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,559
so accessing log join piece there a lot

735
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,400
of you know your apps you can use your

736
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,360
apps

737
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
there are some feedback bio feedback

738
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,279
devices that you can use

739
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,240
that train you there but they themselves

740
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,640
won't

741
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,200
let you go to the next step their core

742
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
the core is connection

743
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,480
optimism resilience and energy and i'll

744
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,279
talk to you so when you practice

745
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
meditation regularly you are building

746
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
some of these characteristics

747
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,039
and then the next and the last step is

748
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
living a life with purpose and meaning

749
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,559
right a lot of the time

750
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
90 percent or 95 of the time we are all

751
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
obsessed with ourselves right

752
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
oh i got this problem i have right but

753
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:01,679
living a

754
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,640
life with purpose and meaning is living

755
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,679
beyond that

756
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,640
right so for example you're clearly

757
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
purpose druid and kyle with

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720

759
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,799
podcast means to you

760
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,240
because really you're putting all these

761
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
energies in this time you're not

762
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,080
making millions out of this right you're

763
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,200
doing a lot of love

764
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,120
yeah so the the biggest thing for me is

765
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
i have uh you know jumped into

766
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,480
the hacker community and i just love

767
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,679

769
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,799

just just for the having the

771
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,240
conversation you know

772
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,240
uh in itself and i like to share that

773
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
with with others and whether or not they

774
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,279

like it or whatever at least i had that

776
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,320
conversation

777
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,480
from for myself and gain the knowledge

778
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
like that's that's the main driving for

779
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,399
me

780
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,880
is uh having really interesting

781
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,399
conversations with

782
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,559
super smart people like yourself dr k

783
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,760
that's that's that's

784
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
you thank you you're a kind man you're a

785
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,039
kind man

786
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
so here's the first one right my

787
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
mindfulness practice

788
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,559
is this relaxed focus um

789
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,200
engaged no judging and it's an active

790
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
process

791
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
relax focus is what i told you right

792
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
you're

793
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,000
can you see the screen now yes you're

794
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,520
seeing the screen if you're

795
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,080
you know watching an object and you're

796
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,120
just

797
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,039
you're aware of the gap between the

798
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,640
screen and you

799
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,799
okay and you're aware of the

800
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,799
surroundings

801
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,799
you're aware of the sound of my voice

802
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,159
and then there's no judging

803
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
right you're not saying hey that dr k's

804
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,799
indian accent is hard to follow

805
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,120
or he's speaking too fast right let go

806
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,480
that judgment

807
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
and then it's an active process that

808
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,360
means your mind drifts away

809
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
and then you bring it back now many

810
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,080
students will come say oh dr k

811
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
the whole class my mind was drifting

812
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,120
away i'm like

813
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
you are aware that your mind is drifting

814
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,480
away right

815
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
that's a big step most people are not

816
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
even aware of that right and then you

817
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
bring your mind back

818
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,960
and we'll do a exercise on that but

819
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
here's the next step

820
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,200
if you do this regularly what can you do

821
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,720
can you see the core slide yes

822
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
the core slide is connection the c

823
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,919
stands for connection

824
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,240
compassion courage right these are

825
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
things

826
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
it may not solve your problem but

827
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,320
regular meditation and mindfulness

828
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,880
will get you in a higher state for

829
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,320
ability to look through

830
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,279
the friends right so for example the

831
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,000
equality

832
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,159
right right i got friends who are

833
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,760
anti-police and they want

834
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
police defunding and all that stuff and

835
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,840
then i got other people who are

836
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
you know totally for the police and

837
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,760
saying hey we had to be compassionate to

838
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
the police

839
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
and here's the thing if you are in a

840
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,320
place of compassion right

841
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
you're able to see both sides right

842
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,320
you have to understand that 99.9 percent

843
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
of the policemen are doing the best they

844
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,679
are

845
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
and now it's a tough job for them to get

846
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,120
back to their home you know they had to

847
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
be safe right

848
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,399
i got friends who are policemen and

849
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,520
their wives

850
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,240
and their spouses worry about them are

851
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,840
they going to come back safely so we had

852
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,760
to have that compassion

853
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,039
i have african-american family friends

854
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,080
who advise their children you know 15

855
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
year olds 16 year old sons

856
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
hey if you get stopped by the policeman

857
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,559
these are the things you're supposed to

858
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,279
do

859
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,440
which many of us don't do right we take

860
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,399
it for granted

861
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,000
so you have to feel compassion for them

862
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
also it's a very small

863
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,320
person and that's what meditation does

864
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,000
is it helps us

865
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,159
make that connection and compassion

866
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,840
right

867
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
optimism right for example uh yes right

868
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,200
now code is pretty

869
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,440
the world is in a pretty scary situation

870
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,120
right but this is not the first time

871
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
we've gone through a thing like this in

872
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,840
the sense that

873
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,720
we have world war two right world war

874
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
two

875
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,760
extended for six seven six seven years

876
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
in some countries

877
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,399
right and it impacted the whole

878
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
part of the world and buildings were

879
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,399
destroyed i mean

880
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,679
i've gone to germany where buildings uh

881
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,760
towns were completely raised

882
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,120
by bombing right or in japan where you

883
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,440
know

884
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,240
two cities were completely eliminated

885
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,360
with the bomb right

886
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
but everything came back and that's the

887
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
point i'm trying to tell you is that we

888
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,320
have that resilience

889
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,840
right we we were we are

890
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,120
a stronger humanity for these challenges

891
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,360
and how we fight them and there's a lot

892
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,799
of optimism there

893
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
and energy the energy also right is it's

894
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,120
a mental state

895
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,000
oftentimes we come back right we are sad

896
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
we are

897
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
we are tired right my i'll come back

898
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
after a long day and my wife will say

899
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
can you do the dishes and i'll say

900
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,399
no honey i'm very tired i you know i

901
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,840
worked all day

902
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
and then my friend barry will call me

903
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,519
and say hey i got two tickets for the

904
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,120
star wars movie do you want to go with

905
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,679
me

906
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
and suddenly i'm energized and go right

907
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,440
where did the energy come from yeah can

908
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,880
you relate to that girl

909
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,120
yeah definitely yeah i mean yeah it's

910
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,000
it's

911
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
the things that you want to do light you

912
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,039
up right you know

913
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,279
right so oftentimes right when you say

914
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,960
you don't have energy

915
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,240
it's often it's a mental state and

916
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,919
that's why meditation helps you right

917
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,480
even do a five-minute meditation

918
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
so coming back to that right so this is

919
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,320
where i am like

920
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,799
you cultivate that core right and then

921
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,240
you transform yourself and there are

922
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,519
tools available

923
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,360
at every stage but the foundation is the

924
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
mindfulness

925
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,240
and today that's all we're going to do

926
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
we're going to try a couple of

927
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,480
things is that does that sound like a

928
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
good summary so far

929
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,159
yeah sounds great would you like to try

930
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,519
a meditation though

931
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,080
sure let's do the meditation and again

932
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,039
if you are

933
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,080
driving uh you can pause pause this and

934
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,440
come back to it when you're

935
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,039
pulled over somewhere or you're in a

936
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
quiet spot where you can

937
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,919
take the meditation okay excellent for

938
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,039
our uh

939
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
view for the people who are listening to

940
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,559
it can you read what's on the slide

941
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
and describe the slide to them so it

942
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,760
says

943
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,159
focus and awareness exercise uh

944
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,000
awareness so there's three bullet points

945
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,120
awareness relaxation and joy and you see

946
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,600
a path uh going through the woods on the

947
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,960
right side

948
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
beautiful right green and it's beautiful

949
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,279
so go ahead sit comfortably keep your

950
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,559
palms on the side

951
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,639
relax your shoulders keep your eyes open

952
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,600
and i'm going to teach you a very simple

953
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,640
three-step

954
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,919
relaxation process right this is

955
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,440
so say with me breath one is awareness

956
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,799
breath one is awareness

957
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,880
so what are you are you aware of the gap

958
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,919
between the slide

959
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,240
the screen and you yes what

960
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
sounds are you aware of around you i can

961
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
hear the

962
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,560
the motors of my computer

963
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,000
and i can hear i can hear the breeze

964
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,560
outside slightly excellent

965
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,918
can you feel where your hands are

966
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,399
touching your lap or wherever they are

967
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,560
the rest armrest yes

968
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,639

can feel the breath have a little smile

1037
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,040
on your face

1038
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,599

1226
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,599
cover your eyes gently massage your eyes

1227
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,280
and stretch your hands up like

1228
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,720
yawning and then let go

1229
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,000
how is that talk to us about it tell us

1230
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
tell us a little bit about it that was

1231
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,040
really great and then

1232
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,440
and again i really like the uh yeah that

1233
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,440
interaction of energy

1234
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,720
feeling it going out but also feeling it

1235
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,280
come

1236
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,319
back i i feel like that's that's some a

1237
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,680
powerful meditation that i haven't

1238
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,160
experienced

1239
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,319
before and i think it has some some real

1240
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,400
kick

1241
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,760
so that's the funny thing is when you

1242
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,800
keep saying you're not good at

1243
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,839
visualizing

1244
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,599
you just did that visualizing that's

1245
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,200
right so for example right uh

1246
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,920
i'm going to ask you think of a red so

1247
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,400
far

1248
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,280
can you think of a red sofa yes okay now

1249
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,040
close your eyes

1250
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,359
can you see the what color is the sofa

1251
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,839
it's red

1252
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,160
do you understand somehow you're able to

1253
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,040
visualize it

1254
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,880
you may not see it like a red sofa but

1255
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,680
the the visual context they say right

1256
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,160
about

1257
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,000
70 or 60 of the brain is dedicated to

1258
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,720
visualization because they are hunters

1259
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,760
and gatherers right

1260
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,440
so we picked the fruit and we could tell

1261
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,119
by the color whether it's a poisonous

1262
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,240
fruit or not

1263
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,599
correct so visualization and then

1264
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
if you're seeing hunting for the prey

1265
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,200
you're able to see the prey pretty well

1266
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,079
right

1267
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,079
so a lot of things that our brain is

1268
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,480
designed you know the visual cortex is

1269
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,559
an amazing

1270
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,319
thing so anyway i interrupted you so

1271
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,920
tell me more what

1272
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,960
did did you feel that relaxation

1273
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,160
turned to joy how was that for you

1274
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,200
yeah i i think um

1275
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,240
it it i i had a

1276
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,480
like i said i kind of had this expansive

1277
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,240
feeling in my heart

1278
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,359
and a lighter a lightness feeling

1279
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,240
um i also so back to the visualization

1280
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,160
thing i did picture at the end when

1281
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,520
when we were saying um imagine the whole

1282
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,200
world

1283
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,640
you know sending uh love and compassion

1284
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,200
and

1285
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,880
you know and all the all the things that

1286
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
we said happy and peaceful and

1287
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
and sending all that to the whole world

1288
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,720
i pictured the whole world

1289
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,040
and i pictured going around the whole

1290
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,400
world and giving those

1291
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,359
those blessings so i maybe i am a little

1292
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,319
i

1293
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,480
i am better at the visualization i think

1294
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,599
i just don't have like a

1295
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,680
vivid you know visual i'm not different

1296
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,200
everybody's different right everybody's

1297
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,319
different right

1298
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,920
when i when i was a kid right out of

1299
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,599
photographic memory so

1300
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,440
in the notes i could even look at the

1301
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
ink stains right i could remember the

1302
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,000
ink stains on that

1303
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
so everybody is different right

1304
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,280
everybody is different

1305
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,280
but hey the to the the people who are

1306
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
listening to it

1307
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,960
please what kyle experience is not

1308
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
necessarily a typical response

1309
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,680
he's already had many years of

1310
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,520
meditation so he got to that state

1311
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,559
pretty quickly

1312
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,079
now not all of you would get to that

1313
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,839
state but listen to this

1314
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,559
podcast again and then i'll provide some

1315
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,040
links

1316
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,839
also uh separately you know so so that

1317
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,520
you know what i've also noticed too

1318
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,640
is is doing it making it a daily

1319
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,559
practice is really important

1320
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,880
um that you know if i did if i would go

1321
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
you know three days in a row and then

1322
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,319
i'd skip two days

1323
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,079
and then i'd start i feel like i'm

1324
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,160
starting over then on that next day it's

1325
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,200
not like i

1326
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,000
i i think keeping that practice allows

1327
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,440
you to get into that state

1328
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,000
quicker and and kind of hold it longer i

1329
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,880
guess

1330
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,480
um that's my experience anyway and uh

1331
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,400
yeah absolutely right any any habit

1332
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,720
right you practice it regularly

1333
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,040
and that's what you know we can provide

1334

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,599
the neuroscience

1363
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,520
uh richie davidson richard davison is a

1364

greatest book is altered traits

1371
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,160
and see we've done a lot of study on

1372
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,359
neuroscience right but

1373
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,000
still brain is a complex thing we don't

1374
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,839
have all the answers right we still but

1375
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,599
that's a very good book

1376
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,480
it's very practical in terms of the

1377
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,359
studies

1378
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,440
and sam harris i'm a big fan of sam

1379
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,680

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,559
character

1381
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,520
um his podcasts and articles are kind of

1382
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,400
funny but

1383
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,319
he's very good on meditation he gets

1384
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,160
meditation he understands

1385
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,359
the power of it and uh right now if you

30 day free uh very very good apps you

1391
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,920
started trying that kyle right his

1392
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,040
app sam addison's app yeah i i did

1393
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,559
i uh i did his 30 days i

1394
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,319
i saw him speak when he was in milwaukee

1395
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,920
and he gave away like i think it was

1396
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,280
right when he started his

1397
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
it was right around the time he started

1398
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,040
waking up at and the book waking up is a

1399
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,200
really good book too on the subject that

1400
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,480
kind of approaches mindfulness uh

1401
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,000
without any kind of religious um

1402
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,760
uh sort of basically just approaching

1403
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,119
mindfulness from

1404
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,520
taking the directions of of mindfulness

1405
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,119
and and doing it without any kind of

1406
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,520
religious connotation attached to it

1407
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,680
and that's a very important thing right

1408
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,119
uh we are not saying

1409
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,559
you shouldn't use meditation for

1410
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,319
religious and spiritual practices that's

1411
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,480
not we're saying we're saying

1412
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,880
at the fundamental level this is a very

1413
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,800
basic meditation is a very basic

1414
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,920
exercise

1415
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,240
like you go walking and running and

1416
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,040
things like that

1417
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,839
if you want to reduce your stress eat

1418
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,559
healthy

1419
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,680
exercise right those are all givens

1420
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,599
and then adding meditation on top of it

1421
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,880
is a good thing

1422
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,359
but we are here talking about it as a

1423
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,480
very basic

1424
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,480
uh um mindfulness exercise that means

1425
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,720
focus and awareness that that's what

1426
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,200
we're suggesting

1427
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,480
any other questions kyle talk to me

1428
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,520
uh yeah sure so let's see here i took

1429
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,520
down a couple of notes

1430
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,680
so you talked a little bit about how you

1431
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,599
know we have this kind of we have the

1432
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,559
default

1433
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,559
network which is you know your

1434
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,160
prefrontal cortex

1435
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,720
and this is kind of way i think about it

1436
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,079
is like there's like this

1437
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,079
hamster wheel that's always going in my

1438
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,359
mind and it's just like

1439
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,119
it keeps running and running and running

1440
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,720
and uh for me

1441
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,760
it's you know the the

1442
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,800
the mindfulness is is

1443
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,880
getting that hamster to just kind of

1444
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,160
chill out a little bit

1445
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,280
just be you know just um

1446
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,800
just relax you know and um i'm wondering

1447
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,520
is

1448
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,839
do do you know anything about like where

1449
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,040
in the brain

1450
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,000
that that it like what what's happening

1451
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,480
you know

1452
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,559
now you don't have any default mode

1453
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,760
network work

1454
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,440
what's what's going on there do you have

1455
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,599
okay so let me do that so

1456
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,520
can you see my go ahead and make a fist

1457
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,119
like this make a fist put your thumbs

1458
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:49,920
inside

1459
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,400
make a fist there right okay this is

1460
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,240
the size of your brain slightly more

1461
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,440
than that but this is the

1462
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,520
brain right okay so the lower part of

1463
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,280
the brain right this is

1464
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,160
called uh this is the oldest part of the

1465
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,319
brain this is called the brain stem

1466
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,359
this is what we share with the dinosaurs

1467
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,480
right we have very basic functions there

1468
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,880
autonomic functions or heart things

1469
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,960
heart lungs all that operate

1470
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,400
with the brain stem some very basic

1471
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,160
violent tendencies you know

1472
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,920
possessiveness all that comes at that

1473
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,200
part of the brain

1474
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,920
that's about 200 to 75 million years old

1475
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,240
we share that with the dinosaurs

1476
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,000
when you put that thumb inside there

1477
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,480
right you put the thumbs inside

1478
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,559
that is called the limbic system the

1479
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,240
limbic system

1480
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,040
or the paleo mammalian brain right this

1481
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,200
goes to about 50 million years ago

1482
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,200
this is the first mammals right these

1483
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,839
first mammals started having emotions

1484
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,400
love and things like that so when they

1485
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,680
had kids

1486
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
they knew to protect the kids that part

1487
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,680
of the brain came in the limbic system

1488
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,680
i'm over simplifying the brain function

1489
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,880
right but

1490
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,640
bear with me it's a good i mean this is

1491
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,799
a good way to to visualize it i think

1492
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,440
from

1493
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,000
a lay person's terms right and then the

1494
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,680
top part of the brain is the neocortex

1495
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,599
the neocortex is the brand new part of

1496
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,240
the brain

1497
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,280
right so guess what

1498
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,319
our primal functions right so now

1499
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,000
the the part of the brain in the front

1500
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
is the prefrontal cortex right the part

1501
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,280
of the brain that's there

1502
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,880
that's the executive functions that's

1503
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,480
the part of the brain

1504
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,520
that tells you hey i'm going to do

1505
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,079
something

1506
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,599
though my i'm afraid to do it

1507
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,920
okay why because the part of the brain

1508
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,520
says there's a benefit for that

1509
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,640
that's the part of the brain that

1510
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,640
worries about it so right so

1511
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,240
we were talking about the visual cortex

1512
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,000
right our

1513
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
ancestors were hunters and gatherers

1514
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,960
right some of our ancestors figured out

1515
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,720
if they don't worry about the winter

1516
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,599
they're going to die right in the summer

1517
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,200
they start worrying about the winter and

1518
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:55,920
they start

1519
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,960
packing foods why because the prefrontal

1520
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,480
cortex has this

1521
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,200
ability to visualize and say hey in

1522
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,480
winter there's going to be snow there's

1523
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,839
going to be no food

1524
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,960
and that so and again you know this is

1525
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,280
these are hypothesis right but

1526
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,119
we believe that the ancestors were

1527
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,559
worried

1528
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,240
were more likely to uh

1529
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,079
to survive compared to people who said

1530
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,000
ah i'll take care of winter when it

1531
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,280
comes

1532
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,720
and so that's part of the default

1533
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,319
programming and there are two parts of

1534
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,440
it there's a part of the brain called

1535
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,280
the amygdala amygdala is the one that's

1536
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,119
the danger part of it right

1537
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,599
it predicts the danger it it gets scared

1538
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,799
and all that stuff

1539
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,440
so for example you're seeing uh you're

1540
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
you're a hunter and you're seeing

1541
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,760
a wine hang and the amygdala responds

1542
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,720
saying hey that could be a snake right

1543
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,160
so fear anger all those parts

1544
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,400
are hardware not hardwired but they're

1545
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,200
very important part of our brain

1546
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,839
and so the prefrontal cortex right we

1547
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:56,640
can get

1548
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,760
practice to overcome that so

1549
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,000
if you're afraid of snakes if you

1550
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,440
practice again and again

1551
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,400
and know how to handle snakes then

1552
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,280
you're able to

1553
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,200
bypass the default program that tells

1554
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,119
you be scared of snakes

1555
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,799
and that's why there are hepatologists

1556
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,480
who know how to handle snakes

1557
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,160
am i giving you a good feel of how the

1558
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,920
brain is programmed and how we can

1559
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,160
change the programming

1560
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,960
yeah can you say that last part again so

1561
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,359
so

1562
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,720
you're when you're able to wait be aware

1563
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,359
that you're

1564
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,680
afraid of the snakes is when you can

1565
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,200
sort of

1566
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,880
i guess that's the first step to this so

1567
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,240
let me give you another example so for

1568
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,760
example right

1569
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:41,119
airline pilots right so airline pilots

1570
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,400
they are trained again and again

1571
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,799
with the flight simulator of all the

1572
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,839
things that can possibly go wrong

1573
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,480
so when they find the fuel is gone right

1574
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,000
fuel has leaked out or something like

1575
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,599
that they've gone through training so

1576
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,960
though there's a part of the brain

1577
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,720
that's afraid of it

1578
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,240
they're trained with the prefrontal

1579
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,400
cortex that

1580
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,680
they've done the training again and

1581
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,160
again that it becomes automatic for them

1582
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,880
to do the steps they need to do without

1583
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,359
panicking

1584
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,640
and that's the same thing with

1585
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,559
meditation or mindfulness when you do

1586
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,240
that practice again and again

1587
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,240
you're able to step back in your

1588
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,040
awareness and say hey

1589
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,839
i don't have to react to this in this

1590
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:26,400
way

1591
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,440
i can respond to that catch it and the

1592
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,040
brain is capable of

1593
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,200
running those simulations for you till

1594
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,799
it becomes second nature

1595
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,079
not to react but respond

1596
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,680
okay is that better is that a better

1597
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
question i totally get that yeah so that

1598
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,640
makes sense

1599
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,280
um so it's basically like almost a

1600
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,760
rewiring of your brain essentially

1601
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,000
bingo that's what neuroplasticity is all

1602
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,880
about right

1603
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,119
that's one year so just because you have

1604
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:55,359
lousy relationships in the past

1605
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,520
doesn't mean your future relationships

1606
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,799
have to be screwed up

1607
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,119
right you can look back at yourself and

1608
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,319
say even with

1609
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,400
with your spouse right there there are

1610
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,000
standard ways where you

1611
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,640
can improve relationships with people

1612
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,280
and mindfulness is a very good way

1613
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,400
to take that step back and say

1614
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,839
hey sometime and it's very easy to blame

1615
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,359
the other person for it right if you

1616
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,000
have anything

1617
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,400
that goes wrong in a any relationship

1618
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,920
right it's the boss's fault

1619
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
right but taking that step back and

1620
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,760
saying let's put ourselves in the place

1621
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,119
of the boss

1622
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,839
and do that now i'm not saying that's

1623
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,680
appropriate for everything right

1624
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,640
uh if you're in a relationship where

1625
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,440
there's physical

1626
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,680
or mental abuse you know don't try to

1627
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,680
defend that other person right walk away

1628
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,599
from that but 80 to 90

1629
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,960
of the time right when we have

1630
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,799
relationship challenges we are

1631
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,880
contributing that to that

1632
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
and taking that step back and being

1633
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,000
aware of that

1634
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,079
you know is going to be helpful does

1635
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,440
that make sense

1636
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,760
yeah it makes makes a lot of sense and

1637
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
so that's what these

1638
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,559
these all things regrets and worries

1639
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:03,920
hide reacting right

1640
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,319
these are all these things that this

1641
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,640
core practice is doing

1642
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,400
building connections building that

1643
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,160
compassion for yourself and the other

1644
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,520
person

1645
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,720
being optimistic you know getting if you

1646
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,760
feel tired

1647
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,799
take the break but then at some point

1648
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,559
you know recharge yourself and go back

1649
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,839
to that problem

1650
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,200
resilience all of us face you know

1651
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,960
i'm here giving you this lecture why am

1652
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,319
i giving you this lecture because i need

1653
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,839
it myself right

1654
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,079
i have challenges in my work i have

1655
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,839
challenges in my relationships and

1656
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,599
you know i have to go through this stuff

1657
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,799
i'm not coming here it's like i've

1658
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,079
figured it all out no

1659
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,000
i'm working through that these are some

1660
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,680
tools that i'm using

1661
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,680
does that make sense yeah it makes it

1662
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,920
makes a lot of sense

1663
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,720
um i have a question about you know

1664
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,520
what's this

1665
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,640
uh you know um i guess in like in

1666
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,000
buddhist teachings they talk

1667
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
about enlightenment you know what what

1668
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,200
what is enlightenment

1669
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,440
what do you have any you know do you

1670
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,240
have any thoughts

1671
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,640
on this uh do you consider yourself an

1672
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,520
enlightened

1673
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,839
being what is what is life

1674
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,720
so i i use the word translucence okay i

1675
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,880
use the word translucent so

1676
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,000
um um that means there have been times

1677
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,240
when i have been in the state of

1678
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,040
absolute bliss right and that has

1679
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,000
happened to me

1680
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,760
um um it does happen to me a couple of

1681
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,880
times where i

1682
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,280
i feel i'm part of the whole humanity

1683
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,799
and there's no difference between kyle

1684
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,280
and me

1685
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,240
and everybody else right so but i i'm

1686
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,680
telling you most of the time i'm

1687
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,040
i'm the usual uh jackass who's going

1688
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,160
through life right

1689
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,960
i fought i am angry i'm pissed off i'm

1690
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,920
like

1691
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,400
you know sometimes it's everybody else's

1692
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
fault is not my fault

1693
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,680
but what i see right um

1694
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,760
to me the the person who comes closest

1695
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,359
to that is the dalai lama

1696
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,480
right so there's one person who asked

1697
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,440
him the question

1698
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,559
you know uh dalai lama when

1699
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,000
it was your life when you felt totally

1700
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,720
happy

1701
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,680
and content with your life and dalai

1702
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,599
lama looked at him no

1703
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,000
no hesitation at all right now right now

1704
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,160
and you know so there are times when i'm

1705
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,119
like that right

1706
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,359
i'm feeling in that state and that's you

1707
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,720
know you have felt that haven't you felt

1708
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,799
that after a meditation session

1709
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,039
where you feel at peace with the world

1710
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,160
and calmness

1711
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,240
right yeah until that somebody else

1712
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,079
comes and pulls your sleeves

1713
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,319
right right yeah i felt that and i felt

1714
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,920
what you're talking about with the

1715
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,920
did you call it translucence yeah

1716
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,000
translucent and i felt that for just

1717
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,520
like i feel like i've just kind of

1718
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,680
brushed up against it for a very

1719
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,839
momentary thing and i'm just like wow

1720
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,039
this is what's

1721
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,760
possible and and i think that's it you

1722
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,200
know and i think that

1723
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,839
uh you know i got into meditation trying

1724
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,200
to

1725
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,400
just kind of enhance um you know be more

1726
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,000
control of my feelings and

1727
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,680
being able to um react to situations and

1728
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,119
have more control over that kind of

1729
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,359
stuff but as i got more into it

1730
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,440
i'm finding that that's it right there

1731
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,039
is is having that

1732
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,559
right now like being in this moment is

1733
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,640
is the is the best thing that's the only

1734
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,839
thing right and

1735
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,440
and being able to to realize not even

1736
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,520
not just on a conceptual level but like

1737
