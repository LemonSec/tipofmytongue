infosec oasis uh you guys kind of gave

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,039
me a little

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,279
before we started recording um you're

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,400
blowing my mind a bit

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,680
because apparently alt space vr

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
has a podcasting uh

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
application so you can have a radio show

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,120
in virtual reality and i just

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
upgraded to doing video

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,320
so now i'm doing 2d i'm not just doing

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,239
audio now i'm doing video

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,920
and now i find out that you can do

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
virtual

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
reality podcasting and yeah you're

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,120
blowing my mind

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,760
and i feel like i'm stuck in the 80s or

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,640
something like that

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
so but uh i wonder if you could just uh

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
you know right now we're in the time of

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,840
quarantine

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,239
coronavirus today's may 6th i'll

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,920
probably be releasing this in two weeks

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
so

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,799
uh you can remember what it was like at

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
may 6th

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
uh and uh but

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
you guys did this i think when it was

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,720
april 18th you guys did the

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,000
the the con and uh just yeah tell me a

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,880
little bit about

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
uh infosec oasis how you guys like came

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,759
up with the idea how you got rolling

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,479
with it and

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
uh yeah just tell me a bit about the the

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,840
process

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,119
the ideation process of it

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,439
yeah um so it's something i've been

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,560
wanting to do for a while

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
i love the idea of doing a conference in

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
vr um and had looked

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,920
for platforms to try to do it in and

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
people to be interested in

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
and uh the i think a lot of people were

49
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,000
interested in the idea but the execution

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,520
of it it was just like the technology

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
was too new and

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,439
not enough people had the uh the time or

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,560
the interest in spending

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,119
much time in vr and once once code

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,079
happened and everybody was trying to

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,200
self-isolate

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
i think all of a sudden people wanted to

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
have that more physical like connection

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,439
with with other people that that

60
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
more social interaction and so

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,080
started talking to people and i talked

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
to sean uh sean and i worked together

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,400
and he was really like yes let's do this

64
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
um and so we we jumped into alt space

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
just trying to like look at different

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
platforms and immediately sean started

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,040
making friends with everybody and got to

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,319
know a whole bunch of people in alt

69
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,440
space

70
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
uh and like after i'll let you tell

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
about kind of that first night

72
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,680
but then that that's kind of how it get

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
got kicked off

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
yeah and and i can tell you from i'll go

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
back to

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
the to my beginning of how it happened

77
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
for me but um a couple years ago i

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,280
talked about

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,760
uh doing alts you know not just not all

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,959
space because ultimately said well i

81
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,080
don't know if it was around back then

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,920
but i didn't know about it for sure

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
but i i thought about doing a vr

84
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,720
conference of some sort of meetups or

85
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,879
something like that just because i think

86
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,920
that it's really important to do

87
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
knowledge sharing and i don't think we

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
do enough of it

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,319
and um i wanted to make it so that way

90
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
we could have anybody anywhere

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,519
kind of come together and we could have

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,959
a group like kind of meet up or

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,920
conference

94
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
uh and share that knowledge and when i

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
was working at a different place one of

96
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,599
my co-workers was like well that's

97
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
that's kind of classist because you're

98
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
saying you have to have like a you have

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,800
to be

100
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
wealthy enough to have a vr headset to

101
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,319
get free information and it really kind

102
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,599
of hit me and i was like you know

103
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,040
she's right you know that's a really

104
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
really good point

105
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
um and so it just never i never really

106
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
did anything with it

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
um and then trent came to me and said

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,599
hey i found this

109
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,360
i found this platform called alt space

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,720
you should check it out and i was like

111
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
okay great

112
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
and he was like what do you think about

113
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,840
doing a conference in here and i was

114
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,799
like well

115
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
i don't know and i just remember you

116
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
know that here's that co-worker on my

117
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,640
shoulder

118
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
you know saying hey don't do it it's cut

119
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,239
you know it's just it's

120
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
you know how do you how do you make that

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,080
bar lower basically

122
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
in in trenton was saying that you can do

123
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
it in 2d you don't have to have er to do

124
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,519
it and i was like well that's perfect

125
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,560
because

126
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
now at least i mean you have to have a

127
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,879
windows machine right

128
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,480
and that i think that's pretty

129
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
attainable for for a lot of people

130
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,799
and and i think that uh most people in

131
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,599
infosec have

132
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
some kind of windows machines you know

133
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
but maybe you don't and and even then

134
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,439
we ended up working it out so that way

135
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,120
it could be streamed um and so that

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
lowered it even more so if you have an

137
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,200
internet

138
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
if you have an internet connection and a

139
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
phone uh you can watch the talks so

140
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,639
so that made it for me uh even better

141
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
like just

142
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,759
overall that just won me over and i said

143
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
let's do it

144
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,120
and so we we talked about it and

145
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,639
we jumped in the first day i jumped and

146
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,320
i jumped in in 2d because i wanted to

147
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
see how that experience was going to be

148
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,840
um in 2d for people who didn't have vr

149
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
and man i got to tell you it was really

150
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,759
immersive even in 2d

151
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,120
the first night we went in there we went

152
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
into a meet up it was what was that east

153
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,759
side

154
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,080
meetup or something like that or it was

155
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
like

156
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
which east side is this let's find out

157
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
and it ended up being seattle

158
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
and um we ended up talking to this guy

159
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
and and i didn't know what the icon's

160
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,759
been people had different icons or

161
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,000
people

162
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
with a heart that's green next to their

163
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
name with a smiley face on it

164
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
um we later found out those are

165
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,759
community helpers which are like kind of

166
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,639
like

167
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,800
helpers to the admins of the game and

168
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
then the people that have an a with the

169
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
trying you know triangular like

170
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,800
a all space logo it's in gold or admins

171
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,039
actually employees default space

172
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,720
and so the the first person we really

173
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
ran into was the guy running this east

174
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
uh east side meetup and his name was

175
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
drufin and he ended up being the events

176
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
coordinator for alt space and so

177
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,280
uh we were like hey we're just jumping

178
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
in here it's our first time uh we just

179
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,759
were looking around

180
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,680
and talking about doing an event in all

181
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
space um and he was like wow you came to

182
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,880
the right place

183
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
like we just really lucked out like we

184
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
just ran into the right

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
place and i was like you know it'd be

186
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
really cool if we could like

187
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
maybe make a own our own custom venue

188
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,960
kind of thing and he was like you should

189
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
go talk to this person over here her

190
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
name's nira and

191
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
we went over and talked to her and she

192
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
created this wonderful place

193
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
for a big event she did for new year's

194
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
and she took us to this new year's event

195
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
that she made and there was

196
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,120
there was like a i've i never like

197
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
there's things in the alts that you

198
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
you can do that you just don't i don't

199
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
even know if they do this in real life

200
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
but she had a choreographed

201
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
fireworks show for new year's what

202
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
yeah it was really crazy it was amazing

203
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
like mind-blowing the music would come

204
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
on like drones came out

205
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
and drones flew out and then arranged

206
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
themselves as an alt space logo

207
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
and this you know ball came up and

208
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
dropped and

209
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
you know it was like this 2020 uh new

210
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
year's thing and

211
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,919
fireworks started going off and it was

212
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,000
going off to the to the music and

213
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,360
everything we're like holy crap this is

214
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
amazing

215
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
and even in 2d i was just like wow this

216
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,600
is cool

217
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,520
and trends like dude you should be here

218
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
in vr right now it's like it's really

219
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
really cool

220
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
and so i i mean even in 2d though i was

221
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
like wow this is really cool

222
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
um and i later got to see in 3d and it's

223
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,720
awesome in 3d as well but

224
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
so you guys just like you signed up for

225
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
all spaces and you just like went in and

226
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,120
like

227
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
is there just like a bunch of is it like

228
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
like chat rooms or something like that

229
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,759
where you just kind of go into it or

230
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,639
like

231
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
and you happen to go to the east side

232
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
meetup and like meet

233
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
the event coordinator and like really

234
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,080
hooked you up with the people that you

235
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
needed to meet to make this thing happen

236
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
yeah it sounds weird but pretty much

237
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,639
yeah yeah the chat rooms is probably

238
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
like a good good analogy i suppose

239
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,199
like it it's they have uh events and so

240
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
anybody can go in and create

241
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
your own event and then from that point

242
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,520
you can share a link which is

243
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
essentially what we did with infosyc

244
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
oasis uh and then you can

245
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
work with their team to get the event

246
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
featured which makes it

247
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
more prominently displayed on the

248
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,919
website and it shows up to people when

249
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
they log into the space so they kind of

250
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,280
have like current events

251
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
so if you log in you can see what's

252
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
going on most of the time they have like

253
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,039
live

254
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,000
music or they have uh games sometimes

255
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,479
they'll do

256
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
like i don't know we've got all sorts of

257
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
stuff there's a house party that we love

258
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
to go to regularly like there's just

259
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,199
just really

260
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
really cool stuff uh and so you can just

261
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
jump in and kind of go where you want

262
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
um and we just happen to luck out and

263
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,479
end up in

264
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
the right meet up the uh the fireworks

265
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
show that you were talking about kind of

266
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,360
reminds me

267
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
of i went to this um it was like an

268
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
interactive art space in uh scottsdale

269
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,639
arizona

270
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,520
it was called wander spaces and one of

271
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
they had like all these like really

272
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
crazy really cool

273
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
creative things that you could interact

274
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,440
with and uh

275
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,520
one they had like this one vr thing that

276
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
like someone made and it was just like

277
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
this bizarre thing of this guy

278
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
singing this really weird song and like

279
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,360
all these like weird creatures around

280
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
them all choreographed doing this weird

281
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,840
dance and like

282
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
you could look around and like they'd

283
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,720
all be doing it in different areas and

284
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
each one to have their own kind of

285
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,519
personality sort of

286
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,599
and it was just like so i see the

287
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,279
potential like i'm listening to this and

288
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,760
i'm like

289
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
okay there's a lot of really cool stuff

290
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,120
that you can do yeah

291
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
the the really cool thing about it is it

292
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
so it's all backed on unity and they

293
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
actually allow people to contribute

294
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,320
both unity assets and uh spaces

295
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
they have limitations on it they

296
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
restrict some scripting and some other

297
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,959
things for security reasons but

298
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,959
um but users can actually submit their

299
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,640
own worlds

300
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
um which is really cool because it's not

301
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
just you know the alt space team

302
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
making these these places like one of

303
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
the one of the fun pastimes is to

304
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
uh to world hop where you jump in and

305
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,600
just you get a group of people together

306
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,560
and you just go explore

307
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
places and spaces that people have made

308
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,920
um

309
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
so it's pretty it's pretty cool that's

310
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
amazing i'm definitely gonna get an

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,720
they're all either in a vr or in 2d and

336
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
they were just

337
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
hanging out in their seats watching the

338
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
show um

339
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
it's really really kind of the gist of

340
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,800
it i mean it's it's

341
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
it's yeah so does everyone have an

342
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,480
avatar it looks like

343
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,760
there's a couple of robots in the

344
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
audience and like um

345
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
do you pick out like what you look like

346
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
and stuff like that in in

347
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,160
alt space vr world yeah there's

348
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
there's um let's see one two three

349
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
different robots you can be

350
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
as far as the shapes go and then there's

351
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,720
uh two other

352
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,279
avatars uh one's like a male and one's a

353
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,160
female like

354
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
um you know appearance and then you can

355
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
customize them more in

356
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,519
robots you can just do their colors and

357
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,519
then the other one you know the the

358
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,640
male female you can adjust all kinds of

359
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
different things shirt colors and

360
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
shirt patterns and pants and all that

361
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
stuff so

362
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
uh yeah they're definitely more i mean

363
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
there could be more customization

364
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
options but i think it's pretty good for

365
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
you know um tell me a little bit about

366
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
the space that you guys created what was

367
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,360
that process like how did you make it

368
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
feel

369
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
con like what what what what things did

370
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,519
you do

371
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
so that you know people could interact

372
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,640
with each other because

373
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
i think trenton you mentioned that you

374
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
didn't want you know you you wanted to

375
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
be something more than just

376
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,320
uh you know 2d videos of people giving

377
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,920
presentations you wanted to have

378
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
that con feel even though you can't

379
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
physically be at a con where you're

380
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,279
interacting and networking with

381
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,600
people learning cool cool stuff from you

382
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
know someone that you just met and

383
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
you know walking around or whatever yeah

384
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,800
so

385
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,079
i'll let shannon say this one in a

386
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,000
minute what i will say is that for the

387
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,240
conference this year we use the default

388
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
spaces um

389
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
and they support a lot of different

390
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
platforms and if you create your own

391
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
custom worlds there can be

392
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
um potential glitches with the different

393
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,440
platforms and so they they actually were

394
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
really supportive and offered to

395
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
test our own custom stuff but to get a

396
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,200
custom world built in unity

397
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
and then get it to their team in time to

398
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,279
review was just too tight of a timeline

399
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
so we ended up using the default spaces

400
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
so like what you can see behind shawn

401
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
right now is actually one of the

402
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
spaces that they provide to users and

403
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
they've got some really neat spaces that

404
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,079
are just

405
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
default and available to everybody

406
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,120
we had some really lofty goals that i

407
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
wish could have worked out but they

408
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,360
didn't but i'll let sean talk a little

409
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,760
bit about

410
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,079
his vision and then kind of what we did

411
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,160
to make it social

412
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,639
yeah so um when trenton told me about

413
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
this i said why don't we do

414
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,920
like an actual oasis in the desert right

415
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
and i was like let's do

416
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
a mat let's just find a map or or an

417
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
asset immunity

418
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
customize it we'll make this desert

419
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
it'll have dunes all around it it will

420
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
be kind of like a bowl shaped you know

421
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,040
and

422
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,399
we're going to have all our events kind

423
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,079
of in the area in the in the middle of

424
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,720
this place

425
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,079
you can see the sand dunes out in the

426
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
distance we'll make it nighttime

427
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,079
we got permission to do the firework

428
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,680
show from nera she said she'd import it

429
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
into our map for us oh that's awesome uh

430
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
yeah i know i know it's pretty cool

431
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
um i wanted to put a stage in there and

432
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
um and like the like use this thing here

433
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,160
that you can see

434
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
that where the sign is with the speaker

435
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,079
so kind of having this

436
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,240
um this big billboard sized um

437
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
screen and um and having having this um

438
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,680
stand here with the with the portrait

439
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
and and then the speaker's name

440
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
i think that that those were kind of

441
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
like the things i just wanted to have

442
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
and then around

443
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,079
around the area you know there's going

444
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,600
to be of course a body of water in the

445
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,079
middle

446
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,639
maybe some palm trees i thought and we

447
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
could put some bonfires there

448
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
have some bean bag toss some basketball

449
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,519
people see

450
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,880
here's the thing the bean bag toss in

451
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
the basketball are really important for

452
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
me i feel because

453
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,720
um it allows people to like do something

454
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,760
with their hands while they're talking

455
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
and there's a lot of nervous

456
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,519
yeah talkers out there and you know we

457
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,720
don't want people to be standing around

458
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
like what do i do and just stand there

459
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,120
awkwardly

460
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,399
and i feel like another thing that's

461
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,680
really cool about all space is that

462
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,959
allows people who have like social

463
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
anxiety to like really

464
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,199
feel more comfortable i've had actually

465
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
several people come up to me

466
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
uh during the conference and say dude i

467
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
really love this because i don't have to

468
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,839
feel so

469
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,040
anxious and i feel like i can talk and

470
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,800
be myself right

471
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
and i i think that's just really amazing

472
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,839
and

473
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,519
and having you know making things a

474
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,560
little bit more comfortable having

475
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
activity for people to do together and

476
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
talk and bond and

477
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
learn from each other while they're just

478
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,240
kind of playing bean bags and talking

479
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,040
about

480
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
whatever you know exploits they've

481
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
learned about or

482
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
have been working on or whatever i think

483
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,399
that's really important thing to have so

484
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,320
ultimately my ultimately my goal is to

485
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,839
have a space like that where we have

486
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,320
some

487
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,000
some activities kind of spread out or

488
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
because it's proximity sound based so

489
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,839
the closer you are to the louder they

490
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
are the further away you get the

491
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
yeah so it kind of feels like you're

492
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
there right um

493
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
which is perfect for what we wanted we

494
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
wanted it to feel like you were there

495
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,440
and i think we pulled that off thanks to

496
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
all space because of the away the way

497
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
that they do the

498
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
talk you know the proximity sounds and

499
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
the way the drill set up

500
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,079
so yeah yeah wow

501
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
an introvert i could pretend to be an

502
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,040
extrovert for a while but like if if i

503
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
pretend too long it starts like make me

504
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,839
tired

505
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
and and video conferences and like

506
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
video calls for work all that stuff

507
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
doesn't bother me like i can do it all

508
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,959
day

509
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,959
i do it all day for work uh and it

510
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,560
doesn't get to me but i the the

511
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
after three or four hours of being in vr

512
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,240
i've i noticed kind of that same like i

513
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
just need to unplug for 10 minutes and

514
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,839
go walk away and be by myself because

515
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,440
it is so much your brain just kind of

516
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
accepts it as

517
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
reality after a while i mean obviously

518
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
you know that you're not truly there

519
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,279
but it fools your brain enough to allow

520
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,399
you to think that you're

521
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
in a physical space with other people uh

522
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
which which is really cool especially in

523
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,000
a time where everybody is trying to be

524
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
socially distant to be able to have

525
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
a group of people that share similar

526
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
likes and interests being able to join

527
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
together in the same physical

528
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,160
space i think was was really cool

529
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
yeah that sounds awesome and i'm a vr

530
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,279
novice i think i've

531
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
you know i've i've played you know i

532
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
played around with like uh

533
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,120
the 3d paint stuff i had a friend that

534
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,320
just kind of like gave me that

535
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
like he you know played the the

536
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,480
lightsaber game thing and

537
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,959
the the pain the pain was cool because

538
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,160
there's like really cool

539
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
things that you can do with like uh fire

540
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
and like you know just like

541
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
i don't know like make like these portal

542
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,440
looking weird things and like

543
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,959
you can do a lot with it like i'm like

544
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,399
wow this is and like watching some of

545
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
the stuff that like people have been

546
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,800
messing around with it for a while you

547
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,240
watch and paint all this stuff

548
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
but i'm just wondering like what's

549
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
what's like just simply like how do you

550
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,199
move around like how do you interact

551
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,079
with people like

552
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,040
how does how does it work

553
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,160
yeah so there's um so with vr and so i

554
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,480
mean

555
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
there's different headsets but it's

556
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
gonna look something like this so i mean

557
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
i i use the uh comparison of like the

558
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
cell phone right like they first were in

559
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
like this giant briefcase and then they

560
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
were like the clunky like giant brick

561
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,800
phones and then they were the flip

562
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,759
phones and now we've got like

563
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,480
touchscreen

564
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
like smartphones um we're kind of like

565
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
past the clunky suitcase phase but not

566
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
much

567
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,000
um so you strap that thing onto your

568
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,680
head and then you can walk around in

569
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,959
uh within a play area in a room that you

570
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:03,519
set up

571
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,400
um if you want to go beyond that play

572
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,039
area

573
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,559
you can then teleport so you kind of

574
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
point a controller to where you want to

575
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,640
go

576
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
and then just push a button and you'll

577
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,079
just teleport there

578
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,919
so you tend to stay in the middle of a

579
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
play area in the physical world

580
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,919
and then teleport where you want to go

581
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,959
and then once you're close you can kind

582
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,919
of walk around

583
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,039
and it takes a little while for your

584
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
mind to get used to like being both in a

585
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
virtual space and in

586
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,559
like real space but after you do it for

587
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,080
a little while it almost becomes

588
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
second nature like you just your brain

589
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
the idea of teleporting places just

590
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
becomes like a part of

591
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
how you move um interesting i i'm really

592
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,080
bad at it i

593
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,360
uh i was at i was at some like

594
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
it was like some conference or something

595
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,600
and they had like vr headsets you put on

596
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
and i put on this one and uh they it was

597
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,000
like

598
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
you guys are probably aware it's called

599
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
something i don't know you push like a

600
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,160
button on an elevator and it takes you

601
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
up to the top floor and you're like oh

602
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
the plank experience

603
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
yes richie's playing experience yes and

604
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
then they they told me to walk around

605
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
and then jump off of it and i jumped and

606
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
forgot that like there's this concrete

607
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,799
ground underneath me

608
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,240
and i landed on my knees and just like

609
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,600
there's like all these people around me

610
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
there's probably like 15 people laughing

611
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
it's like the most embarrassing thing i

612
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
think after that i'm like

613
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
no more vr i'm done no i'm back on vr

614
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
now that you know i can podcast from

615
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,720
there

616
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
yeah yeah the first time i played it

617
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,840
actually was at sean's house

618
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
uh we were is after a security meet up

619
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
in the area and he's like

620
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,039
i got vr as well as i've never tried it

621
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
let's go try so he invited me over

622
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,760
and uh he showed me this it was one of

623
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,799
the oculus

624
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,080
games but there was a table in vr

625
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,679
and after playing for about 10 minutes i

626
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
went to the table to go lean on it

627
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,120
and of course it's not a real table and

628
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,200
it's like i fell and like

629
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
but like after a few minutes of it your

630
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
brain just accepts it as like this is

631
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,039
this is real this is how things are i

632
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,919
mean you know and it takes a little

633
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,960
while to actually like

634
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
reel it back to realize that like no

635
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,640
this is this is not real

636
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
um so

637
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,559
have you read ready player one yeah yeah

638
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,080
yeah for sure i love that book

639
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
yeah so that was one of the things that

640
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,200
one of the i think that one of the

641
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,840
things that we

642
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
we talked about when we were early on uh

643
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
when he was talking about how this

644
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,160
conference

645
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
could happen right and we were trying to

646
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,760
think of names and

647
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
and whatnot and i was like but before we

648
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
even started thinking about names i was

649
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
like dude this

650
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
the covid is how the oasis starts like

651
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
this is how

652
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
it starts everybody's going to online

653
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
yeah virtual meetups everybody's going

654
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,400
to online virtual education

655
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
like this is this could very well be if

656
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
if this continues for any

657
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
longer than you know a short short

658
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,240
amount of time like this could really be

659
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
how it all began you know yeah um if

660
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,559
this were to happen

661
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,919
um for for any long period of time and

662
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,480
and so and it i still think this could

663
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,440
very well be

664
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
uh the case because it seems like it's

665
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,120
going to be a bit longer than people

666
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,600
expect

667
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
i think things are going to be uh

668
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
nothing they are going to go back to

669
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,520
normal

670
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
right away right and i feel like this is

671
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,799
actually

672
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,960
kind of not a bad thing in a way because

673
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
i mean we have so many people who are

674
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,559
just blown away with the whole thing

675
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,559
um and who just loved it and think this

676
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
is maybe the thing of the future but

677
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,960
um yeah that was like our the whole name

678
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
of the influx like oasis was a nod

679
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
at uh ready player one's always how was

680
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
that yeah yeah that's great

681
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,840
i didn't i don't know why i didn't pick

682
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
up on that i was just i was about to ask

683
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,639
a ready player one question

684
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,000
and uh no i love i love that and

685
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,120
actually i remember last year at

686
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,200
cyprecon there was a game that like

687
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,760
referenced

688
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
ready player one you had to like go

689
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,960
backwards on the thing i remember doing

690
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
that and i was like oh wait i know

691
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
i know this um but yeah

692
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,960
um yeah that's fine and the thing is is

693
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,600
there's like

694
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
there's no limitations right like you

695
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
can like learn how to fly or like you

696
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,559
know these things that you can't do in

697
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,640
the real world in this vr world right

698
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,840
and it's just like

699
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
what does that do for creativity you can

700
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
create so many things that you know

701
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,360
and actually do the things that you

702
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
think about in your imagination right

703
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,919
and

704
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,520
has anyone experimented with anything

705
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
like that during the con like uh just

706
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,559
something that was just like so out

707
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,120
there i mean

708
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
the fireworks is super cool i'm

709
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,640
wondering like what were your favorite

710
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
things

711
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
you know during the con so so the uh

712
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
the space like we we wanted to make sure

713
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
that it was people weren't

714
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,760
like one of the things that happens if

715
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
you play all space for a while is you'll

716
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
inevitably have a group of people and

717
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,440
somebody

718
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
you know a kid will come running and

719
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
start yelling and screaming and just

720
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,720
kind of

721
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
being distracting so so we locked down

722
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,080
what players could do

723
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
in the spaces that we had created during

724
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,600
the talks people couldn't talk unless

725
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,960
they raised their hand

726
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,080
while the speaker was presenting and

727
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,159
then in between talks they could talk

728
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,440
and then you can't actually fly in the

729
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,520
game um but we disabled that so that

730
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,799
people weren't like you know flying

731
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,080
around and zooming past each other and

732
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,559
so like

733
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,000
we put some limitations in the space to

734
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,440
try to keep it more like a real

735
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
conference instead of like

736
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,080
you know just crazy with people flying

737
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,559
around

738
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,919
um so so i think our space was a little

739
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,120
bit limited in terms of the crazy stuff

740
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
you can do but if you actually go into

741
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
alt space there are some amazing worlds

742
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
people have done some really cool stuff

743
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
they have an sdk where you can create

744
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
your own code it's

745
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
using typescript uh to interact with the

746
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,880
platform

747
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
um and so people have like one one

748
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
person wrote uh something to like

749
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
basically redo the entire stargate

750
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
um like like the several worlds you can

751
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,039
jump in and out of the stargates it's

752
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,640
just really cool stuff i don't know sean

753
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,360
you've seen

754
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
i don't know what are some of your

755
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
favorite worlds oh man

756
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,880
there's so many i think i'd like to go

757
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,159
to the popular worlds

758
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,000
and then just bookmark them for later

759
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
like when i feel like world hopping

760
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
and um so i'll see where there's a bunch

761
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,039
of people like

762
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
anytime i'm on i'll just look at the

763
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
favorites there's like a worlds menu

764
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
if you go to the settings and you go to

765
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
uh you know like worlds beta you can

766
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
turn the bait on

767
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,760
and it allows you to go all these custom

768
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
third-party or for you know

769
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
player-made worlds right and so i i like

770
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
to spend a lot of time hopping to those

771
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,520
places but

772
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
sometimes i don't have a ton of time to

773
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
go to all of them and as soon as

774
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
everybody leaves

775
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
it'll fall off of the popular menu so

776
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
what i'll do is i'll go into the world

777
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
and i'll go to the info section and i'll

778
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,039
favorite them and go back and check on

779
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,159
them later but i've seen some really

780
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,600
cool stuff there's some

781
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,240
some really cool like japanese place

782
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
that had

783
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,120
amazing like architecture and hills and

784
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,159
then mount fuji out in the distance and

785
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,919
just really really cool stuff people

786
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,120
have made there's been some um

787
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
just some really crazy stuff there's a

788
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
jump park i think is hilarious it's just

789
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,960
like

790
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,480
four trampolines in a park environment

791
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
and it's like like if you walk you can

792
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
walk off the point like all walk off the

793
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
map and just fall

794
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,679
like you know and then you'll just

795
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,240
respawn um so it's kind of weird like

796
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
it's not like made so that you can

797
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,760
i mean the only thing people cared about

798
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,720
was that there were trampolines in the

799
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,080
park so

800
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,279
it's not like they spent a lot of time

801
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,559
making it so that people wouldn't escape

802
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,559
to the trampoline park you know they

803
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,240
you and as soon as you jump on a

804
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
trampoline you'll hear like jump

805
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,640
by van halen or like you go to another

806
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,039
one it'll be like crisscross jump

807
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
or you go to like another like so when

808
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,480
you're jumping on one trampoline you're

809
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
like hopping up and down and it's

810
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
playing music

811
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
you go to another trampoline it's

812
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,720
playing a different song um

813
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
you can go to like this little like menu

814
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
board there and you can hit like a

815
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
rainbow button and it makes like a

816
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,600
rainbow streamer behind you when you're

817
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
jumping

818
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,559
and or like mix your hands into like

819
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,760
some kind of rainbow

820
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
that's it's crazy it's kind of that

821
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,039
paint game you're talking about google

822
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,000
tilt brush where like as you jump around

823
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,360
you'll have these little trails coming

824
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
off of your body your hands

825
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
it's so cool it's really funny that

826
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,720
that's a lot of fun

827
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
i like to take my people like my friends

828
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
who are um

829
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,039
not motion sick uh often to this place

830
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
called the vomiter and it's my favorite

831
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,080
it's so funny

832
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,720
it's like um imagine like a gerbil ball

833
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,559
and you ever seen those those

834
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
you ever seen those um i don't know what

835
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
they're called

836
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
it's like a ball and then it's got a

837
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
bunch of loops around it and you can

838
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,080
spin it in any direction like a

839
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,799
gyroscope

840
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,919
like thing it's like that except for

841
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,600
you're in the gerbil ball and it is

842
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,240
spinning

843
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
all different directions yeah cool

844
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
outside and like

845
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
it's just to make it's just it's crazy

846
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,799
it's called the vomiter

847
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,279
um it's it's nuts uh we have a friend

848
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,039
who made a

849
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,760
development kit that uh our kit that is

850
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,320
in that

851
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,240
um space that she can make people throw

852
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
up whenever so

853
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,279
we like to bring her with us and then

854
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,799
she'll just like randomly make people

855
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,880
throw up

856
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
it's pretty amazing i got a really funny

857
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,480
screenshot of jason street throwing up

858
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
on the dominator

859
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,720
that's so funny it's a good one if you

860
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
ever get into the game

861
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,360
anytime soon let me know i'll take you

862
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,520
to like my home space i'll show you some

863
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,360
funny funny pictures i have posted in my

864
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,480
home spaces

865
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,640
things like that or take you to the

866
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,240
vomiter itself you know and you can see

867
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,360
it for yourself

868
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,760
yeah somebody made like a really really

869
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,400
awful

870
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
i'd say awful it's pretty cool but it's

871
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,400
it's just bad for motion sickness it's a

872
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
like a pirate ship have you seen that

873
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,440
one trenton

874
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,120
yeah yeah it's it's imagine like being

875
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
2000 feet in the air and then you know

876
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,559
this pirate ship

877
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,520
um carnival rides where it goes back and

878
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,080
forth

879
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
yeah yeah yeah it's like one of those

880
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,120
but you're way up in the air

881
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
and like it's swinging and the whole

882
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
world's a tilting yeah

883
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,039
it's it's pretty bad i think that one

884
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,159
it's a contender for

885
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,039
for the vomit for sure yeah um there's

886
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,799
there's lots of cool places but besides

887
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,840
that there's like

888
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,200
uh trenton you want to talk about the

889
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
adventure world that we found

890
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
um oh man there's been so many i'm

891
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
trying to get which one that one is

892
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
that's the one with like the hidden

893
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,559
rabbit hole that we found oh yeah

894
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
so we've got like a whole bunch of games

895
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
that are built in like it's like a

896
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,159
it's almost like a i mean like the

897
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,760
closest influence analogy probably would

898
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,279
be like a catch the flag but it's like

899
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
puzzles within the game that you have to

900
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,640
solve to get to the next part of the

901
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,120
space

902
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
and so you get to move throughout the

903
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,240
world

904
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
and solve pieces of the puzzle one one

905
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,360
bit at a time so

906
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,039
yeah people are very creative i guess

907
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,720
back to the question like

908
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
you can do all sorts of stuff and people

909
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
have found ways to

910
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
really push what the platform can do to

911
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
make it fun wow it's super awesome i'm

912
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,279
really excited to check this out and i

913
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,240
think i'm gonna have to get one of those

914
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
headsets now it wasn't even on my radar

915
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,919
until like right now i'm like oh my god

916
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,520
this is awesome

917
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,000
uh did you put googly eyes on your uh

918
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,279
headset by the way

919
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,039
i did it's so you mentioned the plank

920
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,960
experience i love getting like

921
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
in real life pictures of people with

922
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
googly eyes like freaking out saying i'm

923
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,840
not going to do it i'm not going to do

924
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
it

925
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
lots of the worst was we had a good

926
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
friend that came over and so

927
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,279
if you've played that game uh you you

928
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,640
step into an elevator

929
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,919
and you push a button and it takes you

930
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,840
up to a really tall uh

931
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,120
top of the towel building and you walk

932
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,399
out on this wooden plank and you hear

933
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,240
these creaky sounds and like

934
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
you gotta walk to the end and if you

935
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
fall off you know you you fall into the

936
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
concrete or it looks like you do

937
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
um but uh somebody got to another plank

938
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
and got scared turned around and then

939
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,679
tried to jump back into the elevator but

940
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
the elevator was past the play space

941
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
so they slammed into the back of the

942
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
wall and so like that was the only

943
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
injury we've had on dr so far it was

944
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
somebody trying to jump into a virtual

945
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
elevator and is that the vive right

946
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,640
there

947
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
yeah this is the original vive sean's

948
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,159
got the the newer one

949
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,360
yeah the cosmos looks like this

950
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
and those are the ones you have to have

951
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,559
those connected to a machine correct

952
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,520
yeah yeah they're this one is his is not

953
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:21,919
but

954
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
it's well it is it's just wirelessly

955
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,600
connected to a machine

956
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
yeah gotcha what would you guys

957
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
recommend to somebody that's like maybe

958
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,559
they're thinking about

959
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
you know diving into vr what kind of

960
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,760
headset should they get

961
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,360
man there's so many different decisions

962
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
it kind of comes down to

963
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,440
uh what machine you already have so so

964
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,799
the biggest expense really is not the

965
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,320
headset the headsets are expensive but

966
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,200
you need a

967
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,240
rig to play it on um the oculus quest i

968
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
think is probably the exception of that

969
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,799
it has some built-in

970
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,520
hardware um and then if you really want

971
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,320
to just like

972
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
peek at it some of the mobile stuff like

973
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,120
you mentioned earlier when we were

974
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,240
talking ahead of time

975
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
things like google cardboard right like

976
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
it's not nearly as immersive it's not

977
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,559
going to give the full experience but if

978
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,600
you want to like

979
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,679
just get an idea um at a really low

980
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,960
price point that's a fun way to play

981
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,840
with it too

982
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,880
i don't know sean what do you think yeah

983
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,200
i

984
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,360
i mean i hear things about the go uh

985
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,399
being okay

986
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,320
people want to have two hands um so the

987
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
goalie has the ability to hit track one

988
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
of your hands

989
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,960
um the quest i hear is better because

990
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
it's not as heavy

991
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
um i hear that it lasts a bit longer it

992
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,120
also has two controllers for hands

993
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,159
so you can interact with more things um

994
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,279
if you were going to get one of those

995
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,720
i'd recommend getting like probably the

996
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,440
bigger

997
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,039
storage if you can just so that you have

998
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
the longevity you can install

999
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
multiple games and not have to uninstall

1000
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,799
stuff because there's no upgrade

1001
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,799
option for that you can't like just plug

1002
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,200
in another sd card or something

1003
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,159
and increase the storage so the bigger

1004
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,360
storage is better kind of like a phone

1005
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,000
right

1006
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,880
sure and then if you don't have if you

1007
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
have a computer i would say then

1008
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,000
i mean there's a lot of options out

1009
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,559
there there's the the rift s

1010
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,000
oculus rift s if you'd rather not have

1011
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,720
oculus you can go with htc vive i've got

1012
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
an htc vive cosmos

1013
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
they're probably about six seven hundred

1014
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,399
bucks or something like that

1015
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
the rift i think is maybe 4.99 um for

1016
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,600
the rift s and it's not bad i had a riff

1017
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
before and i loved it

1018
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
um and then of course uh valve makes it

1019
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
her own

1020
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
um what's yours called the the valve

1021
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,039
index it's yeah

1022
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,320
it's kind of pricey it's about a

1023
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
thousand bucks but it has like finger

1024
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
tracking which is kind of interesting

1025
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,640
i think um and so anyway but it's it's

1026
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
pretty cool there's a lot of options out

1027
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,240
there

1028
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
um but i want the cosmos i think it's

1029
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,919
supposed to have better pictures than

1030
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,200
the rift

1031
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
um i had to riff before then to try

1032
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,320
something new

1033
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,640
and uh yeah the whole i mean the whole

1034
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,320
space is exploding i think it's just

1035
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,360
finally getting to the point where it's

1036
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
consumer ready you know right

1037
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
three or four years ago it was i mean it

1038
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,880
was incredibly early adoption

1039
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
um whereas now i feel like it's becoming

1040
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,840
mainstream enough and there's enough

1041
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,960
software out there to make it

1042
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
make it entertaining enough to almost

1043
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,559
justify the uh purchase for a lot of

1044
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,200
people

1045
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
well and like you said sean i think this

1046
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,240
is pushing us to

1047
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
to that space right like being away from

1048
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
people like we still want to be

1049
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
in each other's presence and i mean the

1050
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
you know the the social distancing has

1051
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,279
really changed the way that like

1052
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,799
there's so many places like my wife for

1053
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,720
example she uh her

1054
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
her job like went remote she's like we

1055
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
were remote in like

1056
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,559
two weeks and they would have taken us

1057
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,240
and she works for government energy and

1058
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,360
she's like it would have taken us

1059
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,480
a like five years of stupid

1060
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,399
like back and forth oh we can't do this

1061
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,600
we can't do that and they're like no we

1062
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,720
have to do it and like i made them

1063
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,080
change right and so like yeah

1064
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,000
this is one of those like things that

1065
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,360
just like really

1066
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
uh makes everyone's behavior change all

1067
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
of a sudden so i think

1068
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,480
i think you're right this this vr thing

1069
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
is really gonna start to take off all of

1070
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
a sudden because of that i mean the

1071
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,039
other interesting

1072
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
like so the the headset you know you're

1073
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,559
paying probably about a thousand dollars

1074
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
um if you've got a gaming more than that

1075
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,080
if you don't so the costs

1076
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,679
sound expensive but like so sean and i

1077
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,360
both work for a company that takes our

1078
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,000
team

1079
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
to derbycon or has taken our team to

1080
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,919
derbycon almost every year

1081
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
um and so we've got a little over a

1082
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,279
hundred people on the team

1083
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,960
um so you add that up you know 100

1084
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,679
people going and flying to derbycon and

1085
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,360
doing hotels and

1086
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,679
travel costs and like that that can get

1087
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,399
to be

1088
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,399
uh really expensive and i know a lot of

1089
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,440
people are doing the same thing

1090
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
especially security right like

1091
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,399
the way you get better and stay sharp in

1092
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,080
security is through conferences and

1093
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
information sharing and training

1094
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
um and uh you know

1095
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
one of those for every players on the

1096
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,080
team means that you can actually hang

1097
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,360
out in virtual reality

1098
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,480
all year long uh and interact whereas

1099
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,159
you know one one conference is going to

1100
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
like easily be more than

1101
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,880
a vr rig right so i think especially

1102
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,159
with social distancing people are going

1103
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,840
to start to realize that there are other

1104
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,039
outlets that are more cost

1105
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,159
effect effective really even yeah not to

1106
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,360
say that traveling's

1107
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,760
like i love traveling like the the cons

1108
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,279
and stuff and i think being in person of

1109
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:53,679
the con

1110
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,240
there's no probably there's there's no

1111
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,600
real replacement for that

1112
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
you know yeah i enjoy i enjoy all the

1113
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,039
con stuff like

1114
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,640
you know with their become their their

1115
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,399
after parties their

1116
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,480
other parties their swag you can't

1117
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
forget the flag right you know there's

1118
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,320
um all the other things that you might

1119
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,519
need maybe you need a vendor for

1120
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,960
something and you need to talk to them

1121
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,080
and that's really important that

1122
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,440
a lot of people make good business out

1123
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,760
of this uh you know being a vendor at

1124
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,919
those conferences i think there's

1125
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,200
i don't know if there's a full real

1126
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,559
replacement for that and i don't know if

1127
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
vr will be the solution but i feel like

1128
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,519
if we could do

1129
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,159
some of the conferences at least in vr

1130
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
or if we do some of our meetups in vr

1131
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
not only will it be helpful financially

1132
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,360
but it's also going to have a good

1133
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,679
environmental impact as well because

1134
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,960
think about all the people that are

1135
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,840
flying we find a hundred people across

1136
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,559
the planet

1137
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,200
you know that's a lot of fuel and all

1138
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,039
kinds of stuff you know

1139
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,919
um i just i hate to i don't know i'd

1140
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,360
hate to add all that up but

1141
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,480
i think it's got to be at least

1142
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,640
something better than than doing that

1143
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,799
and you know if there's one one

1144
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,159
conference a year or something like that

1145
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,039
we can all go to

1146
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,320
that i know i like to go to several

1147
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,080
conferences a year because i think it's

1148
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,559
that's where you learn so cyphercon yeah

1149
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,119
so uh but i mean there's nothing better

1150
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,800
than vomit in real life though right i

1151
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,480
mean you got it right right

1152
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,839
yeah um but i wanted to ask you guys uh

1153
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,040
back to uh the infosec oasis um

1154
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
how long did like how looks like you

1155
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,560
guys like ramped up this thing pretty

1156
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,679
quickly like how

1157
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,520
when did you guys like decide okay we're

1158
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,359
doing this and then like what was like

1159
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,040
the steps you took in order to

1160
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,800
to get there i mean it sounds like did

1161
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,918
you have like did you have other

1162
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,520
volunteers i mean imagine you have other

1163
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,560
people helping you out with this thing

1164
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,079
or did you guys all run it yourself or

1165
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,480
like what was that whole process like

1166
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
that was a whirlwind it's pretty quick

1167
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,760
it was like what

1168
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
five or six weeks maybe uh not even that

1169
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,960
yeah not even yeah it was pretty quick

1170
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,760
i mean the cool thing about it is the

1171
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,119
costs were like zero right it's like

1172
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,320
when you have a real world conference

1173
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,000
you have to book the venue

1174
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
way in advance you have to figure out

1175
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
how to raise money to pay for the venue

1176
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
or at least put a deposit in the venue

1177
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
which means that you have to get

1178
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,240
sponsors uh so that you can afford it up

1179
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
front without having to put a bunch of

1180
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,119
costs and so then you have to deal with

1181
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,680
managing sponsors uh you have to deal

1182
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,200
with travel arrangements for speakers

1183
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,720
and schedules and all of that stuff like

1184
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
where is this like the cost of the whole

1185
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,119
conference is like 12 bucks for the

1186
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,000
domain

1187
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,160
um and so that's incredible yeah like

1188
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,960
in alt space is currently trying to grow

1189
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
their user base

1190
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
everything that you do on that platform

1191
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,320
is entirely free they actually gave us

1192
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,599
an event coordinator that was

1193
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,320
super helpful on their team to help us

1194
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,280
so like

1195
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,320
um we couldn't have done that in real

1196
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,680
life i don't use any way we could pull

1197
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,800
the con together that

1198
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,720
that quickly with the size that it ended

1199
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,400
up being um

1200
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,680
what was the size in the world i think a

1201
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,000
safe

1202
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,119
estimate is that there was over a

1203
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
thousand um at the conference throughout

1204
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,320
the day and then even more

1205
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,520
when you add in streaming wow

1206
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,920
so but yeah continue on with the the uh

1207
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
the process let's

1208
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,520
like what did you guys have to do yeah

1209
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,440
so i think like once we

1210
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
decide like after that first night we

1211
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
met everybody we saw the fireworks we're

1212
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
like this is we're doing this

1213
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,960
um sean went and just started asking

1214
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,079
people like hey do you want to talk you

1215
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,200
want to talk and sean

1216
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
shaw knows everybody right like

1217
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,480
everybody knows sean so like

1218
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,359
i think we got uh you know a couple of

1219
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,560
speakers up front

1220
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,200
uh i think david kennedy jason a few if

1221
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,560
you him yeah

1222
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
grifter or leslie so we got a few people

1223
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,240
that were that were

1224
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,599
fairly well known in the community to

1225
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,960
say like yeah this is cool i want to do

1226
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760
it which

1227
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,320
i think really gave us uh the ability to

1228
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,920
then go and and push it and get it in

1229
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
front of the community

1230
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,839
um so we put up a website uh we opened

1231
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,440
up a cfp so that other people could

1232
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,480
submit

1233
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
um and started hitting up twitter

1234
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,160
and people started submitting papers and

1235
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,560
um

1236
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
i don't know it was pretty crazy it was

1237
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,560
just a lot of

1238
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,800
a lot of logistics sean sean did an

1239
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,599
amazing job

1240
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,000
of scheduling the moderators so with a

1241
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,760
space like this you want to have i mean

1242
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,640
just like you have

1243
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,800
uh security at a real con you have to

1244
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,680
have security in a

1245
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,880
vr con um not that you have

1246
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
the fear of like the physical abuse it

1247
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,400
could have in a real con but there is

1248
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,359
still you know you have to worry about

1249
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,000
the the

1250
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,079
emotional abuse and people just not

1251
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,760
being kind to each other

1252
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
and so we well i guess shawn let me talk

1253
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,839
a little bit about that process

1254
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,359
yeah so one of the things that we've

1255
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,000
determined and we didn't really want to

1256
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
do this necessarily but it ended up

1257
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,040
being okay

1258
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,160
we pretty much when once you the idea

1259
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,280
was that everybody comes in through a

1260
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,720
main space and then once they come in

1261
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
through the main space they can hang out

1262
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
there they can interact there they can

1263
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
do whatever

1264
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
they want to go to the conference talks

1265
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,599
they can go to the conference talks if

1266
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,200
they want to hang out there and just

1267
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
play bean bags or shoot hoops and talk

1268
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
they can do that there as well so we had

1269
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
to have moderators just watching that

1270
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,640
space

1271
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,480
making sure that there wasn't somebody

1272
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
causing problems or

1273
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,200
or you know doing things that would just

1274
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,800
otherwise ruin the experience for other

1275
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,160
people that were there

1276
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,920
so we had to have moderators for that

1277
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,119
space and we knew that that was going to

1278
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,240
be a thing

1279
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,800
but the other thing is that the way all

1280
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
space works is once you go

1281
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,320
into a room and you you can have maybe

1282
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,880
60 80 people in a room let's say

1283
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,119
once you get 60 people in that room all

1284
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,480
space has this thing called front row

1285
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,720
that spins up another

1286
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,920
instance of that room with another 60 80

1287
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,880
people in there

1288
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
and then once that one gets full

1289
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,839
somebody a moderator has to go and open

1290
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,640
another room

1291
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,000
and open another room and open another

1292
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,079
room so it's scalable

1293
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,480
but you can only see the 80 people or so

1294
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,760
that are in your room

1295
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,560
at any given time so we needed to have a

1296
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,680
moderator for each

1297
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
instance of the rooms that we had open

1298
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,079
and that was not just like

1299
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,520
it's not going to affect the talks the

1300
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,599
speaker if he's in room 1

1301
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,440
and we have somebody in room 2 running

1302
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
up on the stage the speaker is not going

1303
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
to see the person in room 2. they're not

1304
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
going to see the person in any other

1305
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,079
room in the room that they're in

1306
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
um generally speaking but we can make it

1307
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,480
so that the speaker is visible and

1308
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
audible to everybody in all rooms

1309
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
right it's this thing called on air is

1310
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,320
what they they gave us of the ability

1311
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,920
that we can make somebody visible and

1312
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,079
awful to everybody in all spaces at one

1313
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,440
time

1314
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,240
so we would make that presenter on air

1315
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,359
and then they would do their

1316
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,400
presentation

1317
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,079
and then when they were done we would

1318
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,920
take them off air or we leave them on

1319
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,359
air and we do questions now for

1320
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,560
questions people could raise their hand

1321
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,400
and they could be in any space

1322
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,800
any of the any of the instances and when

1323
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
they would raise their hand a moderator

1324
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,079
would go ahead and write you know go

1325
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,440
ahead and click on them and and give

1326
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,839
them

1327
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,560
a voice ability to unmute them and then

1328
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
make them a visible that make them

1329
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
visible to everybody in all spaces so

1330
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
they can answer

1331
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,800
get their questions you know out and

1332
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,240
have an answer for their question and

1333
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,280
then we would

1334
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,720
go ahead and take that ability back and

1335
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,079
they would kind of just disappear into

1336
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,599
their room again

1337
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,280
and so that made things helpful but the

1338
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
problem is that we had to have like a

1339
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,000
moderate for every single instance that

1340
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
we did so we didn't know how many people

1341
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,480
were going to need

1342
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,599
um and we you know

1343
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,240
just going off the rsvps we had quite a

1344
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,040
bit of rsp

1345
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,599
you know in 100 700 and something rsvp's

1346
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,640
i think it was

1347
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,920
and we knew there would be people who

1348
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,079
didn't rncp they would just come so

1349
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,920
and that's what happened um so we

1350
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,119
weren't quite sure how

1351
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,400
how many of those people were going to

1352
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,880
have to have so i went out and i found

1353
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,920
community helpers friends people who

1354
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
were involved that wanted to be involved

1355
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,119
people who

1356
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,440
had an interest people who you know we

1357
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,640
just reached out to them and said hey

1358
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,440
can you come

1359
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,520
we had several events before the the

1360
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
main event

1361
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,839
and we hadn't come in and we showed them

1362
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,599
how to how to moderate

1363
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,720
how to meet somebody had to kick

1364
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,640
somebody how to ban somebody how to you

1365
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,319
know put that person on air how to open

1366
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,520
up the rooms

1367
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,040
uh all that kind of stuff we went over

1368
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,280
we i think we had like 37 people

1369
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,800
who offered to help yeah um

1370
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,319
one of the big challenges was like this

1371
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,400
was new to us like our

1372
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
first time really spending any any

1373
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,680
amount of time in all space was like the

1374
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
the trial run of like is this something

1375
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,480
we can even do and so we had five weeks

1376
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,200
to not only

1377
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
learn the space ourselves figure out how

1378
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,200
to set it up but then also

1379
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,560
teach everybody that was going to be

1380
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,160
moderating for us and speaking for us

1381
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,599
how to do it so we had

1382
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,880
three or four trial runs um and we were

1383
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,319
still learning stuff each trial run like

1384
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,599
we were figuring out how the platform

1385
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,960
worked and you know little little

1386
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,079
intricacies of how the

1387
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,520
front row system worked and so

1388
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,720
we said from the beginning this is all

1389
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
just a big experiment like we want it to

1390
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,960
work

1391
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,240
but at the end of the day this is this

1392
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,079
is an experiment let's let's let's make

1393
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,680
it fun let's do the best we can to share

1394
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,040
information let's make sure it

1395
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,160
has good community um you know and i

1396
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,040
think

1397
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,319
sean mentioned that we had several

1398
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,920
community helpers uh the cool thing

1399
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,880
about that was that those were people

1400
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,160
from all space they were not

1401
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
involved with infosec at all they had

1402
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,520
part of the community and they're just

1403
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,119
like this is this is cool this is one of

1404
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,720
the biggest events that have happened in

1405
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,040
alt space like i want to be part of it

1406
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,839
and uh so so it was really cool to see

1407
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,040
people that had no idea about

1408
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,160
information security sitting and

1409
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
listening to talks about

1410
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,720
uh you know deep fakes or um

1411
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,680
you know the knock or like what what how

1412
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,880
to break into a bank right like all

1413
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,240
these cool things that like

1414
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
people you know completely outside of

1415
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
our community um

1416
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,920
were able to come in and hear so it was

1417
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,839
pretty neat

1418
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,440
wow that's awesome and what was the

1419
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,119
feedback been from people like what do

1420
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,440
you

1421
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,119
what have you heard so far i think it's

1422
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,520
been

1423
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,800
pretty much all positive i i've i don't

1424
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,280
think we've really gotten any

1425
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,880
noteworthy negative feedback like i

1426
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
think people are really impressed with

1427
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,839
all space i think people

1428
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,640
were really happy with this we had some

1429
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,920
really awesome speakers

1430
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
everybody did a great job it was you

1431
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
know really good content i mean

1432
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,920
almost everybody on the list i think has

1433
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,160
keynoted it other some major con

1434
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,200
you know in the past so we were just

1435
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,319
really thrilled with the people that

1436
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,839
submitted in the talks that we were able

1437
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,200
to have

1438
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
um so there's a lot of really good

1439
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,880
feedback around around that as well

1440
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
i think it's just good content good good

1441
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,400
socializing neat

1442
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,560
neat space as far as we know this is the

1443
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,000
first information security conference

1444
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,760
in vr um at least this size for sure um

1445
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,040
so that was kind of cool that you know

1446
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,079
this is something that's been talked

1447
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,560
about

1448
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,280
in you know hacker hacker culture for a

1449
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
long time right it's been in science

1450
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,359
fiction or

1451
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,400
hacker fiction um you know so to be

1452
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,560
be part of uh you know the first

1453
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,920
conference i think was fun for a lot of

1454
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,880
people was definitely

1455
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,359
fun for me that's great so what did you

1456
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,960
guys learn and what are your plans for

1457
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,440
the future

1458
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,880
oh man um well so

1459
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,280
i i i mean i think a lot of what we

1460
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
learned well first first i

1461
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,640
i i thought this was gonna be easy as

1462
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,760
like this will this you know it's vr

1463
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
let's just get some friends together and

1464
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,319
then when it started ramping up and we

1465
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,359
went to like

1466
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,920
you know 100 and then 200 and then 500

1467
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,280
and then 700

1468
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,200
like it went from like this is this is

1469
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
going to be like a fun event where we

1470
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,079
just try something to like this is a

1471
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,520
real conference with a whole bunch of

1472
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,440
people and a lot of big speakers so

1473
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,800
so um you know i think i tended to

1474
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,000
underestimate the amount of work

1475
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,319
that something like this takes i think

1476
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,599
you know next year i'll have probably a

1477
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,720
better idea of how to

1478
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,319
how to allocate time a little bit better

1479
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,079
and spread things out a little more

1480
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,240
um i don't know we've got some big plans

1481
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,119
sean do you want to talk about where

1482
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,160
we're going next

1483
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,760
sure yeah i would just i want to answer

1484
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,359
the first part of that real quick um

1485
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,800
because i think next year i think one of

1486
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,160
the things i'd like to do is

1487
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,359
you know obviously we spun this up

1488
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,760
pretty quickly uh and i mean we only had

1489
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,359
the website up for maybe three weeks

1490
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,160
before

1491
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,720
before the conference even you know uh

1492
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
before it started

1493
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,520
so there wasn't a whole lot of time for

1494
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
people to rsvp for it

1495
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,599
um you know we had people word of mouth

1496
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,280
and twitter and i could i think i posted

1497
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,960
a couple places on reddit

1498
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,480
um just to kind of get it out there just

1499
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,400
to see if anybody was interested

1500
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,079
and then suddenly like towards the end

1501
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,920
there it started every day

1502
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,319
uh you know it would double you know two

1503
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,839
days preview it was like coronavirus it

1504
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,280
was like watching that

1505
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,400
the exponential curve somebody invited

1506
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,839
two friends every couple of days you

1507
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,839
know so

1508
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,520
um it just started growing exponentially

1509
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,280
and i was like holy cow how is this is

1510
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,920
this gonna

1511
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
is this gonna it definitely crushed the

1512
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
numbers that we thought we were gonna

1513
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,599
have we thought we were gonna have a

1514
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,480
couple hundred

1515
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,200
like trenton said um and then i i think

1516
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,520
the

1517
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,400
the the line that i have that was the

1518
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,079
average line that i had there

1519
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
on my chart i was i was vlogging like

1520
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,000
pretty much every day or every couple of

1521
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
days how many people in the beginning at

1522
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,160
least

1523
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
um and then towards the end it was like

1524
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,359
every day how many people are going to

1525
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,400
rcp

1526
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,280
and it started to get like like i said

1527
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,560
it was just starting to go up

1528
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,920
exponentially and i was like this is

1529
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,880
crazy so

1530
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,319
i think next year we would probably want

1531
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,240
to launch earlier so that we would have

1532
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,359
a better idea

1533
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,720
um get more coverage and things like

1534
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,240
that we probably gonna need if we're

1535
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
gonna do that that would be more helpers

1536
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
um you know more people to come and help

1537
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
moderate and things like that but

1538
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,319
um and then as far as the future goes we

1539
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,520
learned a lot of really cool things we

1540
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,599
learned that people really want to have

1541
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,359
this interaction with people more often

1542
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,640
we had some people who came in

1543
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,680
and they uh you know people who who

1544
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,160
spoke or people who were part of it said

1545
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,599
you know this really brought me out of a

1546
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,760
slump i was in a bad slump

1547
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,200
i felt like i wasn't getting enough

1548
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,280
interaction with people and

1549
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,119
this like trenton said this was real

1550
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,040
enough your mind gets kind of tricked

1551
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,920
into

1552
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,240
believing that you're physically there

1553
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,079
that this really helped them feel better

1554
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,599
you know like it kind of brought them

1555
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,400
out of

1556
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
it was some kind of light you know that

1557
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,160
uh some kind of bright light there at

1558
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,280
the end of the tunnel that wasn't a

1559
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,359
train that they felt like they could

1560
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,599
you know come and interact with people

1561
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,000
and it kind of filled that space in the

1562
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,760
in their in their lives that they were

1563
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,599
they were missing and i felt like that

1564
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,280
was a huge

1565
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,000
you know wonderful feedback that was

1566
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,520
beyond what we what we ever

1567
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,760
expected obviously um that's kind of we

1568
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,359
didn't expect we just wanted to hang out

1569
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,800
with some friends we didn't expect that

1570
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,760
like phil avoid

1571
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,720
someone's like really feel like a mental

1572
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,359
health

1573
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,760
you know yeah boy we're all going

1574
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
through a weird time right now

1575
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,200
so it's like yeah it's cool you guys

1576
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,480
were able to like

1577
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,240
make this thing happen you know that's

1578
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,560
awesome

1579
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,800
i think you mentioned uh two i don't

1580
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,920
know if you mentioned it before we

1581
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,040
started recording

1582
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,000
uh you had a couple bands play yeah so

1583
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,800
we had

1584
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,880
we had some so uh do you want to talk

1585
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,200
about the other thing trenton or

1586
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,599
or is that something we can have the

1587
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,400
music i guess

1588
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,040
one other quick um call out before i

1589
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,160
lose it um

1590
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,359
basically the prayer question of things

1591
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,119
that we learned um one of the things

1592
00:46:59,119 --> 00:46:59,599
that was

1593
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,040
was really cool it was how um

1594
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
how helpful this community can be we had

1595
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,200
a lot of people that just immediately

1596
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
were like this is awesome i want to help

1597
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
um i think within the first week we had

1598
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,160
somebody that's like let's spin up a

1599
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,040
test event i'll

1600
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,560
post it let's get people on the platform

1601
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
early so people were like let's let's

1602
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,160
start getting people used to this space

1603
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,240
i think mcluffin did that

1604
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,000
um i heart malware or ronnie um

1605
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,920
offered to jump in and stream the entire

1606
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,520
event which was something we wanted to

1607
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:27,839
do

1608
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,760
but we didn't have the extra hardware

1609
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
and bandwidth to like moderate the event

1610
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,240
run the event and

1611
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,520
try to deal with streaming so like he

1612
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,440
came in and that helped

1613
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,200
i think you know several probably close

1614
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
to a thousand people

1615
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,800
uh view the event uh they couldn't have

1616
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,319
seen it otherwise so

1617
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,920
um i think one of the other big lessons

1618
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,280
learned is just how cool the community i

1619
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,720
mean i think we kind of already knew

1620
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,400
this but it was demonstrated

1621
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,000
uh once again that this you know

1622
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,480
influenza community can be a really

1623
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,119
awesome community to be a part of and

1624
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:55,920
can be really

1625
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,200
tight-knit you got a lot of really good

1626
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,359
people out there yeah definitely shout

1627
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,440
out to ronnie i heard malware for that i

1628
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,920
mean we

1629
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,359
we wanted to stream it we just didn't

1630
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,640
know how it was going to happen how we

1631
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,079
could do it and then he just

1632
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,920
picked it up and ran with it and we were

1633
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,359
so grateful for that

1634
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,200
you know he he was on the phone with his

1635
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
isp and you know

1636
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,720
getting higher bandwidth and they're

1637
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,800
shipping out a new router for him and

1638
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,640
he's got an extra laptop i think he

1639
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,079
borrowed his wife's computer

1640
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,319
and like set it up to stream and he just

1641
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,400
did a fantastic job

1642
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,400
not only did he come and speak but you

1643
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,400
know doing all that stuff was just over

1644
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,480
above and beyond you know what we ever

1645
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,520
dreamed of

1646
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,760
so and it made it more uh and made it

1647
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,200
reach a bigger crowd right so there are

1648
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,480
a lot of people i know there are people

1649
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,359
who

1653
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,880
there's a stream and they're like oh

1654
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,240

1655
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,599
i was worried i was going to miss it and

1656
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,280
and it was so great to be able to send

1657
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,480
him that information

1658
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,240
and even afterwards people who were like

1659
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,920
oh man i totally wanted to

1660
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,599
come and i overslept you know or

1661
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,520
whatever because they were overseas

1662
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,119
and um you know i was like oh but you

1663
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,280

1664
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,079

1665
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,839
recorded somewhere where people can find

1666
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,200
it

1667
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,119
so that's a great question because one

1668
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,319
of the things that we're

1669
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,720
we we're it's actually emerging right

1670
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,359
now is that

1671
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
ronnie's been uploading the videos for

1672
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,720

1673
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,079

1677
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,160
if it's there or not if it appears yeah

1678
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,440

1679
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,800
that the videos will all go live on

1680
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,839

1682
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,520

1707
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,800
think we

1708
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,400
you had an issue you just kind of a

1709
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,599
scary thing happened in one of your

1710
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,680
talks the first talk right trenton where

1711
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,359
um you couldn't meet somebody maybe we

1712
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,960
didn't at one point

1713
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,040
during the during the event we didn't

1714
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,720
meet the whole crowd

1715
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,480
i mean people were so courteous and

1716
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,319
quiet like yeah i didn't know it for

1717
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,839
five minutes

1718
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,079
like normally like we went to a ton of

1719
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,119
events um

1720
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,720
to just kind of get an idea of how they

1721
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,480
work and what the workflow is and how

1722
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,440
they're supposed to be running what

1723
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,280
works and what doesn't work

1724
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,839
and always there was people just yelling

1725
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,280
over top of each other asking questions

1726
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,720
out of turn be noisy

1727
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,640
and like so the only events that we saw

1728
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,000
that ever worked out were the ones where

1729
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
the moderators just needed everybody

1730
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,480
um so so to be in a room where we forgot

1731
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,200
to mute

1732
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,640
everybody for 10 minutes and not have

1733
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,160
anybody take advantage of it was just

1734
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,640
like

1735
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,319
you know that's pretty cool like i know

1736
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,400
there's always you know infosec drama or

1737
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,760
whatever but like

1738
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,119
from our experience with the conference

1739
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,960
like everybody was super respectful and

1740
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,160
and was uh you know great to have

1741
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,839
or someone yelling at their cat like all

1742
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,599
of a sudden get out of my way or

1743
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,800
whatever that'll happen

1744
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,760
maybe that happens yeah it's funny

1745
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,119
especially at the like the more casual

1746
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,880
social like hangouts when people are

1747
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,280
just

1748
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,960
you know hanging around like you forget

1749
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,559
that people are not in vr until like all

1750
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,520
of a sudden you hear like

1751
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,440
the best is when like somebody like my

1752
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,800
wife would have come up and like poked

1753
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,079
me a couple times and that's like the

1754
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,440
creepiest thing because like you're in a

1755
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,000
world you can't

1756
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,280
see them and all of a sudden somebody's

1757
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,359
touching you it's just like like when

1758
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:39,760
when

1759
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,920
virtual in real life makes it's always a

1760
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,400
surprise

1761
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,480
sure and then like when you're in an

1762
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,839
experience with like a band

1763
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,480
like uh are you in a crowd with people

1764
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,040
and you can

1765
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,559
like you can go up to people and talk to

1766
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,240
them you know while the all the bands

1767
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,680
play like you're at a concert kind of a

1768
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,760
thing is that sort of how it works

1769
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,960
yeah so we got sean uh found this

1770
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,720
really cool venue and became friends

1771
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,880
with with the owner of the space of the

1772
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,440
world and

1773
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,839
they uh trash panda said that we could

1774
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,200
actually use it for the concert so it

1775
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,559
was if you've been to like

1776
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,559
def con or black hat it was like one of

1777
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,480
the cool like high-rise

1778
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,720

1779
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,040

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,920
venues really really cool space and so

1781
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,559
we had a live acoustic set to open it up

1782
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,480
a guy that plays regularly in alt space

1783
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,079

1787
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,000
we had a live dj afterwards as well that

1788
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,200

1789
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,640
80s style like infosec like the oasis

1790
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720

1792
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,160

1793
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,920
there you go there's the uh there's

1794
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,599
there's part of the club so

1795
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,599
um yeah you can see like you can have

1796
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,280
people up right next to the stage

1797
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,119
and like listen um and then it's a

1798
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,960
really big space and so as you get

1799
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,480
further away from the stage

1800
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,160
the audio gets quieter and you can

1801
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,200
actually have circles with people

1802
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,240
talking

1803
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,000

1804
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,839

1807
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,280
lot of people come to the after party

1808
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,400
which was which is

1809
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,359
that's something that i think i would

1810
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,800
change next year too is announce that

1811
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,400
too because we didn't announce it until

1812
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,839
like the day of

1813
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,680
um that we were doing it and and so we

1814
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,040
didn't have as many people come as i

1815
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,400
think we'd hope but

1816
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,839
um it was still really awesome i think

1817
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,359
more people would have loved it would

1818
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,800
love to come if we would have made it a

1819
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,520
little bit more

1820
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,640
um you know publicized or whatever

1821
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,559
so how did it work with a like a live

1822
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,000
acoustic like is it is

1823
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,559
avatar have like a you know a guitar or

1824
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,119
like

1825
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,280
you know like and he's just like at a

1826
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,880
microphone on his computer doing it or

1827
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,079
sorry i don't really

1828
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,880
how'd that work yeah so i think the way

1829
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,079
that they did it was that they would

1830
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:48,880
actually pipe

1831
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,680
the uh they had an audio mixing panel

1832
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,160
and that

1833
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,119
would take their um their voice mic and

1834
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,720
then their acoustic set or you know

1835
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,920
whatever they're using for music

1836
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,400
um and plug that into the headset wow

1837
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,520
and they can adjust the volume on the

1838
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,079
player

1839
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,079
some of them i think sometimes you'll

1840
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,599
see people that actually use like

1841
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,000
a second bot for the audio um but both

1842
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,359
of these players i think did it straight

1843
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:10,079
through their

1844
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,280
their main primary players audio

1845
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,839
wow i'm gonna have to get on this vr

1846
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,839

00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,240
the month

1897
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,559
every month uh i like the first of the

1898
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,319
month because it's not like a city sec

1899
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,839
meetups where it's like every second

1900
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,680
whatever of the month

1901
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,280
the first of the month rotates so that

1902
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,520
allows people who have wednesday soccer

1903
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,839
practice to show up on the next month

1904
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,440
when it's on a saturday or when it's on

1905
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,880
a tuesday or whatever

1906
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,720
so i think we're going to keep it on the

1907
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,079
first day of the month it's easy to

1908
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,520

1909
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,440
from five o'clock until at 10 o'clock or

1910
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,119
