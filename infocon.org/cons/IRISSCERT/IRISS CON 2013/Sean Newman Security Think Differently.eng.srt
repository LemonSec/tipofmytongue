00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,570
sorry I didn't do that say

been in that kind of IP networking

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,680
computer-security industry for actually

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,000
too long now 17 years i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i started</font>

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,779
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> three calm if anyone can remember</font>

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
three calm and started designing

9
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,529
ethernet switches and then quickly moved

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,509
into product management and looked after

11
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,570
their security portfolio for a while

12
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:34,250
looking after<font color="#E5E5E5"> uTM's of files and spent</font>

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,079
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years doing endpoint security and</font>

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,760
then I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource fire from the</font>

18
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,790
about product so I'll stop there so as

19
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,550
part of this think you know we've been

20
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,620
asking this question and would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

21
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,839
security differently if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

22
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,940
to be compromised and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've heard so</font>

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,950
much scare stuff today I don't want to

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,860
linger on that too much and I think

25
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jessica's I like Jessica's kind of</font>

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,819
analogy of a little bit of fear and then

27
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,189
something practical that you can

28
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,960
actually then solve the problem with

29
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,860
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just lots of fear and then</font>

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,809
you're just rabbit in the headlights

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,250
going you know what the heck do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do now</font>

32
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,710
you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me something that I can</font>

33
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,840
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a difference with so</font>

34
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,339
hopefully hopefully I'm going to do that

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,649
in the course of the next 20 minutes or

36
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the reality bit</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">companies ending up in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> headlines but</font>

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point here is these are big</font>

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,420
companies like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves of you know</font>

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,579
they're smaller organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but it's it's not working so what's</font>

44
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,309
going on you've only<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to look if you</font>

45
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:45,678
want any more evidence look at the

46
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,409
verizon data breach report it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary</font>

47
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:49,999
sometimes to see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how simple some of</font>

00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,420
these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that are actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">getting these organizations in headlines</font>

50
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,359
kinda says that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> now some</font>

51
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,639
things fundamentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> change something's</font>

52
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,708
different as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the way we're</font>

53
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:01,639
trying to defend ourselves just isn't

54
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:06,469
actually solving the right problem

55
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:08,568
anymore so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know over the last one</font>

56
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:11,000
10 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years the way we have been</font>

57
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:13,369
defending our networks is to look for

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,409
nailing things things that we know how

59
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,299
attackers work and putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in</font>

60
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:20,179
place to block them there's been that

61
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:22,459
constant cat and mouse the attackers get

62
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,440
a bit cleverer we get a bit smarter as

63
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:25,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the defenders or use the defenders</font>

64
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,680
that's helping you to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

65
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations and it's just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of been</font>

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that but it hasn't really</font>

67
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">been yeah that serious it's been a bit</font>

68
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,730
annoying for the IT department set up

69
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,010
and you're having to reimage a whole

70
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,230
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> for machines to try and get your</font>

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,679
users productive again but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

72
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,869
it hasn't really caused yet bo much of a

73
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,739
problem beyond that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we know it's</font>

74
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,879
changed and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've been</font>

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing a lot about today for the main</font>

76
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,000
things have changes we've gone from just

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,429
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> this indiscriminate malware and</font>

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,739
attackers putting malware and places

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,480
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to infect machines to find</font>

80
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,879
information that they can easily

monetize passwords credit card

information bank account details to

actually again finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific</font>

personal specific organization that has

some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they want or they</font>

86
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,299
have a grudge to bear with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll actually</font>

87
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,940
start focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you they start yeah</font>

88
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,799
working out what the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

89
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,739
have how you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying to defend</font>

90
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,150
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> how they can bypass those</font>

91
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,160
specific defenses and I said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

92
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,049
indiscriminate so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

93
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,760
the best malware they could that would

94
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,829
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know enough hit them to</font>

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some money out of it this</font>

96
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:37,280
time yeah they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming after you for</font>

97
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:43,578
your specific information they have to

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it right the problem is as defended</font>

99
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,519
as we haven't yet there isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a silver</font>

100
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,290
bullet we haven't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">history of creating technology over the</font>

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,190
past two decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and help you</font>

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">input each time a new technologies come</font>

104
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,980
out we got yeah this is the greatest

105
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good now this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to solve</font>

106
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,129
world peace for you this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,540
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing that's going to take</font>

108
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,698
me out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to sleep at</font>

109
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,560
night and it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalog and</font>

110
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:06,019
continuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog of technologies but</font>

111
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,540
they're effective in helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce</font>

112
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,280
the noise but they died and wont stop

113
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,810
every attack and probably if you look at

114
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,298
yeah the top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can probably</font>

115
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">add Sam boxing to that to pick up yeah a</font>

116
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,700
new technology that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been you know</font>

117
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,190
specifically aimed at trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,039
advanced attacks again it's helped in

119
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,440
technology it's another layer that gives

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,850
you another percentage of coverage but

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,010
it's not hundred percent it's not a

122
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,960
silver bullet so if it's a focused

123
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,000
attacker who had enough of a motivation

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,340
the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is enough</font>

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,680
value to them for them to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know be</font>

126
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,210
troubled to actually go to the lengths

127
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,100
they need to to get it they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

128
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,039
you know someone mentioned the mandiant

129
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,350
report earlier and daddy mentioned that

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,040
the attack came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lockheed Martin and</font>

131
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:59,140
this is the this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how a man diem</font>

132
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,430
represented it in their report you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

133
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,360
see these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are successful because</font>

134
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,830
they're incredibly well organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,300
the attackers our industrialized they

136
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,450
have their own ecosystem they're hiring

137
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,639
graduates to do their programming yet

138
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,650
they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sophisticated and they're</font>

139
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,600
very structured and they go through a

140
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,440
distinct set of processes to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

141
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,669
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be successful and even</font>

142
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,469
the things he had like Jessica was took

you look back to the men that verizon

more these guys have figured out how to

the cases someone comes and tells you

326
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,740
our solution relies on signatures we're

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,050
openly saying our signatures won't catch

328
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,670
everything but that's why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,290
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking differently we need to</font>

330
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,479
wrap something else around it the

331
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,650
signatures they're very level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense</font>

332
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,500
but they're not going to do everything

333
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,910
for you you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a different way</font>

334
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,910
of thinking a different set of tools

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:43,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are going to be much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more effective</font>

against these cleverly ops of the skated

337
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:50,660
attacks so we kind of talked about in

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
terms of weak signals the thing about

339
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">weak signals is but on their own they</font>

340
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,400
might actually look quite benign someone

341
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,350
in the audience that the end of andreas

342
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,660
accession mentioned indicators that

343
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised and this is kind of the area</font>

344
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,060
where we were starting to think now to

345
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,070
have effective protection against these

346
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,359
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of advanced attacks we need to</font>

347
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,760
start to look for indicators of

348
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
compromise I guess this is another area

349
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">where dat this and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will another</font>

350
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,790
annual to the different thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

351
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,780
we used to saying my security is only

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,780
effective it

353
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,279
 up from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spindly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now my</font>

354
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,600
security is only effective if like if I

355
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have any endpoints getting</font>

infected if I'm blocking at stopping

357
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,320
everything that's great well yeah we

358
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen now</font>

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,190
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these organizations are</font>

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,110
ending up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news you're not ending</font>

361
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,310
up in the headlines because you had an

362
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">end point they've got a piece of malware</font>

363
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,930
running on it that doesn't attract

364
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,510
attention it's when you've lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> a load</font>

365
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of and critical intellectual property or</font>

366
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,649
a lot of customer data those are the

367
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,480
things that get you in the headlines so

368
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,640
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able to maybe shift</font>

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,500
your thinking of it too maybe like

370
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,410
breach detection there's an extra layer

371
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,290
beyond intuitive detection yeah and the

372
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,149
prevention if you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

373
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,519
enough then that's what keeps you out of

374
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:23,190
the headlines if you can see the weak

375
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,589
signals given off as the attack starts

376
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,750
think back to that life cycle each of

377
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,510
those phases the attackers have to go

378
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,040
through every time they move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

379
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,670
another phase they're giving off some

380
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,829
more some different signals if you have

381
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,899
a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could stop them at any</font>

382
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:40,920
one of those points then you want before

383
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,930
they get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where they</font>

384
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,969
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> free so you know that attack</font>

385
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,319
cycle it's not all bad news it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

386
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,149
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you only have one shot of</font>

387
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,100
detecting them<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet to you have quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

388
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,450
few shots because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get them at</font>

389
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,420
any of those stages before the last

390
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,980
stage bear attack has an active in

391
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,170
Sector successful and they either have

392
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,690
to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they realize it's</font>

393
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,279
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much effort actor I think</font>

394
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,839
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else made that point it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

395
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,920
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much value they thought they were</font>

397
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,189
you've got it's just it's not worth it

398
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,779
and they'll move on and like having

399
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,399
extra strong locks on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows of</font>

400
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,410
your doors someone will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pick a</font>

401
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,089
lot for long enough or the security

402
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:19,800
system if they can't get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they</font>

403
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:23,490
move on it's also kind of a try to find

404
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,529
an analogy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of illustrate how</font>

405
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:29,010
some continuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyses looking for</font>

406
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:30,630
weak signals really works so I came up

407
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the James Bond one so if there's</font>

408
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,800
any other James Bond fans out there

409
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,720
maybe anyone is old enough to remember

410
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,229
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> man in the Golden Gun first time</font>

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">around like me sadly but if you look at</font>

412
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,420
this picture this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what conventional</font>

413
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,089

421
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,089
stop that person going through well what

422
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:08,459
if you could see them once they got to

423
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,579
their hotel room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they end up with</font>

it's not just going at that point in

427
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:19,860
time or<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray everything looks good I</font>

428
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,579
what I see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not something I know</font>

429
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,579
it's bad but it's continuously of

430
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:28,290
continuing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look and analyze the</font>

431
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,998
<font color="#CCCCCC">information that you had are mainly</font>

432
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,309
combine it with other signals that you

433
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:34,170
see to actually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture</font>

434
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:38,969
isn't quite different a little bit

435
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">further down the line so we kind of</font>

436
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,899
talked about that in context of this

437
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,269
continuous security model I don't think

438
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">any other phases in this they're not new</font>

439
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:49,769
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the attack during an</font>

00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:52,199
attack after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack you can go out</font>

441
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy plenty of products</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that fit in</font>

442
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,670
any of those silos today I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

443
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,410
we're saying in the different way

444
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be a lot</font>

445
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,519
more joined up with those silos we need

446
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,949
to have something that covers but the

447
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,779
whole attack continuum because if we

448
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,370
don't we aren't allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

449
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:12,089
continuous analysis that i just showed

450
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:13,648
in a previous example you need to be

451
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,720
prepared for the fact you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

452
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:17,039
attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you know you need to be</font>

453
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,870
able to see everything that's in your

454
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,890
environment if you can't see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

455
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,928
don't know what you're protecting your

456
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,079
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to control it but if you</font>

457
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:28,350
see all of those and the lighter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

459
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen them before and then you keep</font>

monitoring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see some other</font>

461
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,570
indications you can put those together

462
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:40,580
and go actually those things together

463
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:42,289
Igor a handgun can you got to do it

464
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,850
everywhere you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can't just do it</font>

465
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:45,649
in your network you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it on</font>

466
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,928
your end points you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

467
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:50,299
everywhere things moving around coming

468
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,269
and going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your network and off your</font>

469
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,620
network the whole time more than ever

470
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:57,740
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices bring your own devices</font>

471
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,199
virtual machines virtual servers things

472
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,509
are constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming going spinning up</font>

473
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,279
new applications you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to keep on top</font>

474
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:06,279
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep doing it continuously</font>

475
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,168
and if you do it continuously then that

476
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,570
means you can harden your assets up

477
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:16,519
front so reduce that chances that

478
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,610
someone will even get past the front

479
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:21,289
door so you know they may I may just

480
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,610
fail at the first hurdle<font color="#CCCCCC"> and move on now</font>

481
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,679
we know that most of these are parts

482
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,658
attackers don't generally get tripped up

483
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,220
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when you're looking</font>

484
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">for these weak signals that are going to</font>

485
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,240
help you see your fast attackers you've

486
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,439
got to keep the noise out for everything

487
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">else because otherwise it's going to</font>

488
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,779
mask it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of example I thought of</font>

489
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,908
earlier looks like like noise<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelling</font>

490
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:43,190
headphones when you get on the plane too

491
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,470
much recently you sit on a plane and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

492
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,059
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put regular regular earphones</font>

493
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,220
that come with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPod or your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">smartphone's got your music on you put</font>

495
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,789
them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ears sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a plane you</font>

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn it on and you can barely turn the</font>

497
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:57,080
volume up loud enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even hear the</font>

498
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,909
music anymore now you swap those for a

499
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,949
pair of noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> cancelling headphones and</font>

500
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,929
once you stick in your ear you block out

501
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,240
the background noise suddenly you back

502
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,440
to you know how it sounds when you're

503
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,820
walking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street or when you're</font>

504
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,620
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home so you've got to keep</font>

505
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise down otherwise you're not</font>

506
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,789
going to be able to see these weak

507
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,729
signals<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like I said a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them but</font>

508
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:19,850
quite benign on their own so it's it's

509
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,090
not an easy thing to do so good you've

510
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,168
got to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself the best chance</font>

511
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,939
during sure you're sort of familiar

512
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,950
during you've got to give yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

513
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,269
best threat protection so the signature

514
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,740
stuff that you've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using that's too</font>

515
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,920
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to another layer</font>

516
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,690
keeping the noise out that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

517
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,920
keep most<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out and just leave it</font>

518
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,240
so you've got these advanced attacks

519
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:43,370
that you need to worry about me to look

520
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,200
for these weak signals then in the after

521
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,580
phase so this is the kind of this is the

522
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,400
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not thinking</font>

523
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,409
about after as being forensics like

524
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,540
andreas is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you found</font>

525
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,679
out by some other means that you've got

526
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,909
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and dig</font>

527
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,950
into and work out what it was that

528
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,050
caused it and how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

529
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,090
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse engineering if you</font>

530
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:04,960
actually make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in joined up you can</font>

531
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use this kind of preemptively</font>

532
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,230
because you already know the scope

533
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,610
through monitoring everything you know

534
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,890
where files have gone you know what

535
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,449
they've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got there if you don't</font>

536
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,480
to find now that file<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought was</font>

537
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,520
good didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get detected by your</font>

538
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,760
antivirus or your IPS you now find it's

539
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,559
bad like the gun example because of some

540
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,940
other signals that were given off you

541
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,820
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

542
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">instantly do something about it and we</font>

543
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,559
head back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point about you know</font>

544
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,900
there's a time it takes before an end

545
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:42,110
point being<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective becomes a headline</font>

546
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:44,809
problem for you so to sort of elements

547
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:48,110
of thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this first is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

548
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:50,800
files in your environment bank don't

549
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,270
stop tracking files so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

550
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,500
keep tracking files know where they've

<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your environment even if I'll</font>

inspection your<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS will your file keep</font>

554
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,110
track of where it goes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

555
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,480
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which end points it went to</font>

556
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,610
initially how<font color="#E5E5E5"> its moved around your own</font>

557
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,929
round room network sometimes the way it

558
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,330
moves around your network could be a

559
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,400
weak signal that actually tells you that

560
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,169
you've actually got a problem then and

561
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,970
because you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking it you know</font>

562
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,160
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it came in first so as soon as you</font>

563
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:23,030
do identify it you've got a root cause

564
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,470
so you don't have the vit Weka mobile as

565
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,030
the Americans call it here when you're

566
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,740
trying to have to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> re-imaging in</font>

567
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,389
point endpoints of the hooks that you're

569
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,980
the

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,590
order to actually stop an infection or

stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> infection propagating you can</font>

572
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,620
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this to find the root cause</font>

573
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,030
where it came in and you know sort out

574
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,280
the machines in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an order that's actually</font>

575
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,620
going to help you contain the problem

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of it it also helps you to</font>

577
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,459
show how long you've been effective for

578
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,810
so if you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this bad file was</font>

579
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,880
out in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment for two minutes</font>

580
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,409
you probably have a fairly good sense

581
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,850
are you really good shape if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find</font>

582
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,490
out that that files been there for three

583
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">months then you you instantly can tell</font>

584
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,210
you you're wise you'll CEO that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

585
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,129
actually have a bigger problem than that

586
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,290
already so it's already valuable

587
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,570
information from from just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

588
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,730
level of monetary so some of that

589
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do with with tools</font>

590
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,140
that already existed in your environment

591
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,080
so you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like net flow and</font>

592
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,010
s flow that are built into the network

593
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,929
environment that you already have and

594
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,760
then use tools on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to capture</font>

595
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that can tell you what</font>

things is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints it took me to a</font>

598
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,649
we do that in our product but you can

599
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,500
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little thing you can do that</font>

600
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,900
yourself but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about when the file</font>

601
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,030
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an end point now this is this an</font>

602
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,480
incredibly important weak signals you

603
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get by monitoring what an endpoint</font>

604
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,080
is actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a file arrives</font>

605
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,080
there or at any point how the process is

606
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,520
interact and it's kind of it's kind of a

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> take on whatever else is</font>

the relationship of files and processes

and connections out to the internet

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,620
actually works on an endpoint is a

613
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,590
really powerful way of seeing some of

614
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">these weak signals so I wanted to go</font>

through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this example and the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is actually we had a we</font>

we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a utility</font>

621
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,149
was a zero-day so minus two days this

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tracking</font>

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,360
tracking them across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network point</font>

625
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,900
what they do when they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

626
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,530

0<font color="#E5E5E5"> D minus two days and because they are</font>

tracking the files across the network as

629
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,830
well they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the</font>

scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problem contain it and have</font>

themselves protected within 40 minutes

632
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,650
so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of power that you get</font>

633
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,410
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's still within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 yeah</font>

still two days minus 40 minutes inside

when there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero Davis announced</font>

637
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,860
floor Oracle get around to doing a patch

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">they say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you be credibly powerful</font>

639
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,709
way of looking at it so that let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

640
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,430
quickly explain because it's quite a

641
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:12,800
simple example so user on a machine

642
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,730
opens up their browser and goes to a

643
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,490
website nothing unusual<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and the</font>

644
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,960
chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that then the URL they've</font>

645
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,210
gone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've given what we've heard</font>

646
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,250
all others you know the sophisticated

647
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,150
ways that attackers are the compromising

648
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:31,520
real websites using hijack servers to

649
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">create some copy sites that I have had</font>

650
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,090
it excuse me legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> booking domain</font>

651
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,870
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to train your users</font>

652
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:40,399
not to click on links to these sites so

653
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,810
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think yeah this browser goes to a</font>

654
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,310
website probably looks like perfectly

655
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:48,409
legitimate site and then Java launches

656
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,020
so nothing unusual about that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

657
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,150
pages use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java as a practical language</font>

658
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,230
it's going to render that<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page let's</font>

659
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,240
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look more interesting more</font>

660
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:01,310
interactive but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that jar instance</font>

661
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,650
makes a connection to the internet on

662
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,720
downloads of file so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

663
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,220
starting to look quite suspicious now in

664
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,660
case your job is just supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

665
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,610
rendering the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page it's not supposed</font>

666
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,680
to make its own internet connections

667
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,120
maybe if it was the java update or it

668
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,040
might make your internet connection but

669
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,439
not it is actually you know java ranging

670
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,830
that's doing the rendering so it

671
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,950
downloads of fire and that fire runs and

672
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:29,530
that file downloads another file and

673
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,580
runs that what this turns out is this is

674
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,990
stereotypical behavior of an endpoint

675
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:38,360
that's been hit by a drive-by download

676
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,450
so in this case the user by whatever

677
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,250
means make

678
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,740
very sophisticated phishing email you

679
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,070
you couldn't have trained them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

which is using a problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

682
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,639

684
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:59,370
like this unless they have to do if you

use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero day on Java happens that</font>

686
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,549
this machine is running java so

687
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,320
instantly they've now got control of

688
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:06,809
this machine and what they've actually

689
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,789
used is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java then to download their ways</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they drop the file and then they</font>

691
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:12,330
download some other malware on that and

692
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,860
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably at that point they've</font>

693
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,029
got some of their remote access tool

<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're now running on this end</font>

695
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,139
point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows them then to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

696

control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that endpoint and continue</font>

697
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:26,039
with their attack all unknown to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">either stop that file from running you</font>

there's another real problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font>

722
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,389
here you might go as far as actually

723
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:20,309
stopping Java running on their own or

724
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:22,080
any of your endpoints so that you know

you're protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> till John till</font>

Ottilie's can analyze properly an<font color="#CCCCCC"> oracle</font>

727
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,419
can say okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

728
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:35,310
a patch<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a ton and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

729

wagon so that's kind as much as I wanted

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,179
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> really i'd say it's guys just</font>

00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of changing your thinking really</font>

732
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,860
just thinking more about the fact that

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know detecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're blocking it's</font>

he he summed it up really well he said

with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of attacks you don't</font>

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,430
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so the conventional</font>

748
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:17,820
techniques of using signatures or

<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior to spot things just isn't</font>

750
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,470
working anymore so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

751
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,990
thinking differently whether it's

752
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,480
daddy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot idea where you can</font>

753
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,370
attract these attackers in and see what

754
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,900
their techniques are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're kind of</font>

755
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,070
diverting them for maybe from attacking

756
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,780
your real<font color="#E5E5E5"> end points that's one</font>

757
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,179
technique this is another technique

758
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,070
looking for these weak signals you put

759
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,900
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in together in my ordering and that</font>

760
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,639
the use of is easy certainly something

761
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,140
that's growing within the industry or

762
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,570
set someone mentioned earlier and

763
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,240
there's already initiatives in place to

764
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,580
share them amongst vendors so as my open

765
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">IFC and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's another initiative as</font>

766
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,070
well so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually share this</font>

767
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:00,350
information across the industry and make

768
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,350
it in more open<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>
