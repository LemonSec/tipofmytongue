websites belong to Irish organizations

128
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,969
that being compromised on hijacked by

129
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">printers to host phishing sites so they</font>

130

can target people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other jurisdictions</font>

don't want to buy their own service

135
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,000
that's why they're criminals they

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,940
elected to steal them so they were

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,210
hacked into companies websites they will

138
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,250
load up<font color="#E5E5E5"> their phishing pages on those</font>

139
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,590
websites so anybody fishing testing

140
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,940
those websites as nominees will actually

141
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,210
not see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phishing page of phishing</font>

142
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,040
pages of a hidden page on that side but

143
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,060
when the Kremlin send out their spam

144
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,090
emails to turn fish victims they will

145
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,310
have a link back to it to that page so

146
