1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,200
good afternoon

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,360
um this presentation I apologize in

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,599
advance is Powerpoint 1987. I am

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,379
terrible at doing decks

5
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,480
that's it's a bad start and it gets

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
worse so my background is um

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,660
my background is uh mostly an ungarish

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,699
where I've spent 10 years as a system

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,760
administrator in 12 as a cyber crime

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,098
investigator and I'm currently director

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,079
of forensics.com sec

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,760
and rubbish at doing PowerPoints

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,320
apologies first unsolicited dick pic of

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
the day

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,660
so digital forensics use cases obviously

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,300
with criminal investigations we have all

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,879
sorts of other incidents there where

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,199
forensics become important are necessary

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,379
uh mostly the

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,140
data breaches a lot recent recent times

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,780
a lot of Insider threats with the work

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,860
from home

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,740
um during the cover pandemic we've had

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,439
situations where certainty a lot of uh

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,200
forensic case is coming through from

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,720
where either supervisors were working

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,580
from home and people they were

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
supervising weren't or vice versa and

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,520
things obviously gone a bit wrong so

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,380
there are many many use cases for our

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,080
digital forensics uh the

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,939
suppose the the one that everybody's

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,799
taught about is Criminal investigations

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,060
where everything has gone to court and

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,340
it has to be for a delivery of a court

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,200
case but that isn't necessarily the case

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
a lot of places just want to know what

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,259
happened I may not want anybody to know

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,119
about it but they do want to know for

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,840
their own uh purposes what went on

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,659
there's a massive amount of tools

42
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,700
um apologies if this is a bit small

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,799
because there are a lot of them there

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,680
are thousands of tools that are used in

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,979
forensic investigations from

46
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,619
Suites like encase which try to do the

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,960
whole thing down to little tools which

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,899
do one specific job like maybe examining

49
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,819
a particular portion of a Windows

50
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,640
registry uh whatever it might be log

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,020
analysis tools but there are a lot of

52
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,340
there's a lot of overlap between

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,099
forensic tools and normal Windows

54
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,000
applications so like uh hackers live off

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
the land so to do forensic analysts

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,400
sometimes the point is that there's a

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,879
massive array of tools and you have to

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
kind of know which ones you're going to

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,900
use for which specific job with that

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,000
said there's a a very simplified

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,099
workflow in forensics where you have an

62
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,180
incident

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,700
and you rush out to preserve and collect

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,099
the evidence that you are going to need

65
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,860
to find out what went on and to examine

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,620
it and decide what parts of it are of

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,620
use to you or parts aren't what parts

68
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,599
aren't relevant you're going to analyze

69
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
the bits that you've decided are useful

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,879
and you're going to report what happened

71
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,080
that's at a very very simple level

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,540
there's obviously in some cases an awful

73
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,940
lot more to it than that

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,200
law enforcement is I suppose where we

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,480
mostly think of forensics being used

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,920
because it's the one that hits the news

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,659
most of the time and they have their own

78
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,099
issues

79
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,420
so they have larger data sets uh year on

80
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,000
year uh every time they're going out

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,459
doing searches they're finding more data

82
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,980
because drives are bigger there are more

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,099
drives and computers are more devices uh

84
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,860
you went into a premises maybe 15 years

85
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,360
ago you might find a computer now you're

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
finding three or four mobile devices of

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,799
tablets

88
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,019
four or five laptops whatever it might

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,400
be

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,379
um there are obviously storage

91
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,879
requirements in law enforcement for

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,620
those when you when you gather it you

93
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,780
have to store it somewhere

94
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,920
um and that becomes an issue

95
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,360
one of the things that law enforcement

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,040
is very slow about because government

97
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,620
agencies do longer procurement processes

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,940
they've tighter budgets they're

99
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,400
competing for with other departments for

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,519
our budget and all that can cause issues

101
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,519
Global cases are a big issue that as has

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,100
been said before I think it was Mikko

103
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,899
said it this morning geography has been

104
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,580
taken out of the equation

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,199
and you could be dealing with an

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,759
incident that spans four or five

107
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,199
different legal jurisdictions that

108
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,180
becomes an issue but the one thing that

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,040
law enforcement does have

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,620
that doesn't affect industry is that

111
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,419
they're prepared they have everything in

112
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,580
place for dealing with forensic

113
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,340
incidents because they're planning them

114
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,720
they're going out and getting a warrant

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
they know where they're searching they

116
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,940
kind of know what they're looking for

117
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,259
they don't pretty much know what they're

118
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,820
going to get and what they're going to

119
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,100
do with it so they don't have some of

120
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,310
the issues that industry have

121
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,520
[Music]

122
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,380
in Industry again you've got the large

123
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,300
data sets you've got Cloud usage you've

124
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,520
got tons of apps that people might be

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
using throughout the business

126
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,139
um one of the big ones there is lack of

127
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,180
evidence sources

128
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,820
um you think that you can find out

129
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,560
everything that's been happening on your

130
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,020
environment but maybe you're missing

131
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,280
evidence in that

132
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,500
for a lot of organizations for cost

133
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,820
reasons

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,919
they perhaps won't buy logging or

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,139
they'll have restricted logging or less

136
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,960
logging maybe logging over five days

137
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,460
maybe over 30.

138
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,520
for cost purposes so one of the issues

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,500
that you have for forensics in industry

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,240
is you go in and find out that somebody

141
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,300
Forever This is gone

142
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,620
qualified Personnel are not always

143
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,120
in-house

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
and incidents do arise very very

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,160
suddenly unlike law enforcement it can

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,199
happen and usually will I have three on

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,460
a Friday afternoon of a bank holiday

148
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,440
weekend when you're just about to head

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,660
off camping for the weekend

150
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,360
and another issue that uh that tends to

151
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,620
uh

152
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,259
cause a lot of legal head scratching in

153
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,620
industry is the use of Julius devices

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,360
bring your own device

155
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,000
if you're

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,800
investigating an incidence that has a

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,020
dual use device where somebody's being

158
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,780
accessing company data legitimately on

159
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,880
the device and also using it for

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,620
personal purposes

161
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,340
you now have to skirt around potentially

162
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,080
intimate information that might be on

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,259
that device and that can cause a lot of

164
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,380
head scratching and slow things down

165
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,360
now

166
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,039
in forensics there are a number of

167
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,700
things that take an awful long time

168
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,520
[Music]

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,500
identification of your evidence sources

170
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,380
in a large operation can take quite some

171
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,199
time gaining access to them like who has

172
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,020
access to this particular server or this

173
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,780
particular instance

174
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,759
If We Gather it where are we going to

175
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,139
store it

176
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,139
and setting up that storage what are we

177
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,819
going to examine it with

178
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,479
with forensic tools you can't just go

179
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,800
out and use them you've got to verify

180
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,539
them because you need to know your

181
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,419
results from them are you know what you

182
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,819
see is actually what happened so you

183
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,979
just to verify them you can allocate out

184
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,340
roles who's going to do what

185
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,020
the ones I have involved there are all

186
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,919
ones which can be done in advance which

187
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
is what we're talking about today which

188
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,520
is forensic Readiness planning

189
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,319
and I've highlighted those was there

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
which they

191
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,699
they are

192
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,979
quite time consuming

193
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,780
but don't necessarily have to be done

194
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,780
when the incident pops up

195
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,660
forensic Readiness gets a call out in

196
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,380
the new ISO 27001 which just came out

197
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,500
this month and if you look in the 27002

198
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,780
document for that they have a nice

199
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,520
little synopsis of what forensic

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,860
Readiness is and what you should be

201
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,800
doing uh isaka also have their own

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,120
definition of it

203
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,360
and the UK Ministry of Defense require

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
it for all their I.T teams it absolutely

205
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,919
must be written into the incident

206
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,220
response plans for those teams

207
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,520
so when you go into

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,380
an investigation your initial questions

209
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,800
are where is our data who has access to

210
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,400
it do we have all the data we need

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,199
um how long are we retaining it for

212
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,259
because retention periods May uh if if

213
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,940
they're a lot if you've lower retention

214
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,458
period on a particular set of data you

215
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,779
may have to prioritize that above

216
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,820
something which would otherwise be a bit

217
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,380
more important

218
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,059
how do we get us who's going to do it

219
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,520
and where are we going to put it and

220
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,020
that can be the hardest one where are we

221
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,820
going to put it's huge it's Terribles

222
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,959
[Music]

223
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,660
so these I would say are tasks that you

224
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,820
don't want to leave until your busiest

225
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,700
time uh when you're in the middle of an

226
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,380
incident and you're trying to figure out

227
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,899
what is going on in your environment

228
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,060
the last thing you need to be doing is

229
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,360
identifying where everything is

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,560
allocating out roles uh setting up the

231
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,060
hardware and the software that you're

232
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,820
gonna that you're going to be using

233
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,100
identifying which tools you're going to

234
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,220
need and where you're going to get them

235
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,339
uh verifying them uh setting up

236
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,480
documentation like chain of custody logs

237
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,300
labeling receipts and all that good

238
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,760
stuff

239
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,580
[Music]

240
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,680
so some practical measures that can be

241
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
taken which means that those items are

242
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,380
done

243
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,320
prior to Any Given incident on the top

244
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
one and this comes up if you if you look

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,360
at a lot of the standards for example 27

246
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,980
000 a month in this

247
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,220
information hasn't registered know where

248
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,779
your assets are

249
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,959
know who has ownership of them

250
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,300
what their attention times are and

251
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,620
whether or not you're logging them

252
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,360
and it's a response plan which is a

253
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,740
requirements in a lot of organizations

254
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,380
but very often doesn't reach down as the

255
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,000
the levels of detail that you require

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
for forensics it kind of says uh yeah we

257
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,860
get to this point and then so and so is

258
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,540
in charge of forensics but it doesn't

259
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,060
give any detail as to what that process

260
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,760
would or would not look like

261
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,420
so um

262
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,140
let's give me a second

263
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,540
preparation of documentation

264
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,700
you can set up all your uh your your

265
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,300
case management all your procedural

266
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,420
documents all your labeling Define your

267
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,880
Communications process all this can be

268
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,459
done prior to any incident happening and

269
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,500
the point of this uh sorry exercising as

270
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,600
well gets you through all that process

271
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,459
and finds the gaps in it and finds out

272
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,079
where you're missing evidence but the

273
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,959
point of this is that you can do this in

274
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
an organization and be ready for an

275
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,519
incident or when the incident breaks out

276
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,220
you can be paying over the odds for a

277
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,779
consultant to come in and do it for you

278
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,720
and missing the first couple of days of

279
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,060
your response doing stuff that could

280
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,410
have been done in advance

281
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,120
[Music]

282
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,360
which brings us to a slightly different

283
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,279
workflow where the Readiness goes in at

284
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,480
the beginning and when the incident

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
kicks off the preservation collection

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,360
examination and Analysis are expedited

287
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,300
they don't take as long to do and

288
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,820
they're more complete you're not missing

289
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,140
anything

290
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,240
you've already know where all your

291
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,519
sources are and what's important and how

292
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,460
to get them

293
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,980
[Music]

294
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,399
the benefits quicker much more efficient

295
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,440
response

296
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,720
quicker to identify the attack factors

297
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,820
if it's an ongoing attack you're getting

298
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,980
in there and finding out much quicker

299
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,860
what's actually going on on your systems

300
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
you're less likely if you're following a

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
process to inadvertently damage evidence

302
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,339
you're not going to take the wrong steps

303
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,500
accidentally delete something or fail to

304
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,540
collect something and not be able to get

305
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,640
it back later on the lower cost

306
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,339
I would say that logging

307
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,399
is so important that if you're making a

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,620
saving by not logging

309
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,440
it's a false saving because the cost

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,720
when it comes to an incident of not

311
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,700
being able to determine through the logs

312
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,980
what happened is going to be the cost of

313
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,959
actually going and doing forensics on

314
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,300
all the affected boxes to find out what

315
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,640
happened on them which is a much longer

316
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,060
and more expensive process

317
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,239
[Music]

318
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,220
and again on the course because you've

319
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,399
completed it beforehand you're not in a

320
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,540
position where you're paying somebody

321
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,360
else to do it for you at incident

322
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,880
response rates emergency rates which can

323
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,660
be

324
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,180
quite High

325
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,040
the other main point of it is

326
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,079
if you have this planned in advance and

327
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,399
you know where your evidence sources are

328
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,040
you've less disruption to the normal

329
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,720
business the normal business can

330
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,060
potentially continue without being

331
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,500
disrupted by the investigation because

332
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,820
people know what they're looking for

333
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,399
where to get it and ideally where to get

334
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,200
it without interrupting somebody else's

335
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
day

336
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,100
you can detect threats earlier because

337
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,779
you're actually responding a lot quicker

338
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,600
and a lot more efficiently

339
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,399
entire Insider threats because what

340
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,899
everybody knows there's nothing quite

341
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,060
like an audit log to make people think

342
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,700
before they go and do something there

343
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,500
are a couple of prime examples that are

344
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,600
in the place

345
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,480
in my last career it was regular that at

346
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,720
least once a year it would be report out

347
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,200
on the number of people who had misused

348
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,300
certain systems and been detected by

349
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,620
audit logs

350
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,600
um being disciplined as a result that is

351
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
a great deterrence to people

352
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,459
particularly inside a threat

353
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,180
and forensic Readiness then also allows

354
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,639
you to demonstrate high standards for

355
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,579
compliance so when the regulator comes

356
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:03,779
around and says well you know what are

357
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,820
your systems are they couldn't offer

358
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,920
have you been actually negligent here

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
you can show that no we weren't

360
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
negligent we were prepared we're

361
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,220
prepared as best we could be to respond

362
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,560
as well as we possibly could

363
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,260
I seem to have flying through that you'd

364
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,579
be glad to hear so thank you

365
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,420
well

366
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,019
if anybody has any questions so

367
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,920
oh dear

368
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,800
what's your password no I'm sorry

369
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,260
getting into incident response how would

370
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,880
you recommend someone does it what's the

371
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,320
skill set you'd be looking for it sounds

372
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,600
like perhaps you were trained up in the

373
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,120
police but it just it sounds like an

374
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,519
exciting interesting sort of discipline

375
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,560
how how does one jump in

376
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,860
there are my pathway is not particularly

377
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,320
standard I went from the police into

378
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,720
cyber crime investigation and into

379
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,699
forensics that way and from there into

380
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,160
incident response and very often the the

381
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,680
pathways is slightly different than

382
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,260
somebody will come from maybe uh psych

383
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,720
analysis uh

384
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,060
uh into insulin response and down to

385
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,620
forensics from there there are many

386
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,240
different Pathways it's like you know

387
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,680
there are so many different environments

388
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,839
so many different uh ways of working

389
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,240
around the place uh

390
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,279
you can pretty much you

391
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,079
you can go in as a generalist or you

392
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,459
could win as a specialist and you can

393
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,860
broaden out but

394
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,600
there are many ways there's no one wants

395
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,500
that way

396
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,779
my way is probably a little bit weirder

397
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:42,079
than most

398
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,209
[Music]

399
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,350
yeah

400
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,279
[Music]

401
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,720
so yeah that was a great Arc I thought

402
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,820
it was very informed with the forensic

403
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,760
Readiness and such like I'm researching

404
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,079
into this area myself because I'm

405
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,699
getting into it but I've noticed that

406
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,620
forensics been around for a while and

407
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,399
the actual issue itself and it strived

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,500
from law and someone died you know and

409
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,240
then evolved into computer science and

410
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,339
all this but what I've noticed is

411
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,459
there's no framework as per se that's

412
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,019
kind of like right there's the bread and

413
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,899
butter go ahead and find its own very

414
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,959
interesting looking at that new uh ISO

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,699
standard or the one that you just

416
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,040
referenced there in your slides to check

417
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,860
out that you know to to kind of get a

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,240
holistic view you know what I mean

419
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,980
because for people coming in into the

420
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,899
industry they're probably trying to

421
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,360
think right what tools what procedures

422
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,300
what documentation what process what

423
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,279
kind of like uh where should I look

424
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,639
because when you're looking at forensic

425
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,180
analysis at autopsy fdk whatever Os Os

426
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,279
forensic anything it's very hard to kind

427
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,779
of get lost

428
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,940
in terms of the documentation and what

429
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,440
you need to go on the right path you

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,420
need to go at when you're analyzing data

431
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,579
before the decodes ovary phase and all

432
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,600
that so

433
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,579
you know I just thought you might have

434
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,099
noticed that yourself in the industry so

435
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,480
again with with this industry there with

436
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,040
the

437
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,339
um the technology sector there are so

438
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,439
many different ways of doing the one

439
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,439
thing and some people will go all out

440
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,079
open source some people will go uh with

441
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,020
a closed system some people will prefer

442
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,700
a particular type of environment and

443
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
others will go completely opposite

444
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,020
direction forensics is the same there

445
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,900
are people who focus in on a particular

446
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
tool and a particular workflow unlike to

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,260
follow that

448
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,539
and there are people then who will go

449
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,559
with a completely different you

450
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,880
mentioned autopsy there which is

451
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,980
excellent and open source and a great

452
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,720
way of

453
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,559
um

454
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,799
I suppose building up skills in that

455
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,900
area and it has a very nice workflow to

456
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,760
it but some people would not like that

457
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,220
at all there are also then multiple

458
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,020
tools for for example mobile devices

459
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,660
which look completely different

460
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,120
and have a completely different field

461
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,820
so it's uh there's

462
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,799
there's no one-set way of doing it and

463
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,059
the same thing applies to standards

464
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,640
you've got your ISO 27001 you also have

465
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
your nist you have you know as many

466
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,380
standards as you like

467
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,840
um and it's basically pick what what

468
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,200
suits your particular needs at that time

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
a little bit of research decide what

470
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,200
what you want and what what suits you

471
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,720
and uh go for that and go and open

472
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,380
hi

473
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,360
templates can be

474
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,700
I suppose

475
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Google is your friend for a start but

476
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,580
what you want is to get something that

477
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,679
you can

478
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,660
customize for your own particular needs

479
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,820
without breaching anybody's rights so

480
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,720
you're looking for something that

481
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,340
somebody is actually letting you

482
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,440
customize giving out for free so there

483
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,580
are a lot of organizations that do

484
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,860
things like that

485
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,080
for example organizations like this is

486
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,419
not specifically about templates for

487
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:13,980
forensics or anything but organizations

488
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,900
such as Enterprise Ireland will have

489
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,640
templates for various different things

490
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,080
which they put out a lot of the UK

491
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,179
government organizations have templates

492
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,960
the ncsc in the UK and here would have

493
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,900
templates and uh I suppose advice on how

494
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,419
to how to go through certain things

495
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,240
and if they allow those documents to be

496
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,820
used then you're within your rights to

497
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,940
to use them as uh you know for your own

498
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,600
purposes and

499
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,860
hi there

500
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,660
um I'm just curious as somebody who's

501
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,880
worked in the garden and now in

502
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,820
forensics and an incident response

503
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,280
um what's your recommendation to to

504
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,799
General Industry around you know when

505
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,039
how to um walk that line around you know

506
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,559
you know win an incident and and when to

507
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,539
uh bring in the

508
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,600
the the outside forces

509
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,120
yeah so I would say

510
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
let them know as early as possible they

511
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,020
may know something

512
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,520
about it

513
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,440
that could be of use to you

514
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,780
so this is not just about reporting so

515
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,760
that the guards know where to put their

516
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,400
resources and all that sort of stuff but

517
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,500
they could be dealing with four or five

518
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,720
other businesses that are in the same

519
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,120
position as you under an attack from the

520
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,919
same group where they found out

521
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,200
something that might be of use to you I

522
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,960
suppose the the counter to it is the the

523
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
fear of the you know the systems being

524
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
seized there are are interrupting

525
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,600
business and things like that okay so

526
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,000
there's a long-standing

527
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,059
um I suppose we can clearly call it a

528
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,320
tradition at this stage a little

529
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,299
practice of

530
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,559
never if at all possible damaging a

531
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,820
roaming business

532
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,320
even

533
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,480
to the point where if a business is

534
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,179
suspected of criminal activity and are

535
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,740
being searched under warrant if they're

536
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,179
a running concern

537
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,039
they like a person are innocent until

538
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,280
proven guilty and that there is very

539
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,640
little chance that that their systems

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,720
are going to be picked up and carried

541
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,460
out the door and then put out a business

542
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,980
it simply isn't the practice

543
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,600
so there's no downside to reporting that

544
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,439
I that I know of

545
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,240
I think we have one more question

546
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,570
hi

547
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,889
[Music]

548
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,679
um so first off really interesting talk

549
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,320
um I suppose with regards to

550
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,000
have you seen yourself maybe in the last

551
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,980
10 15 years or so traditionally

552
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,600
forensics and investigations would take

553
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
place with on-premises data but

554
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,460
obviously with I suppose so many

555
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,260
companies moving toward the clouds

556
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,480
across

557
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,220
I suppose have you seen different

558
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,860
challenges uh you know if you have to

559
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,179
investigate you know if there's a

560
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,820
forensics case with data stores in the

561
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,900
cloud you know it might be a company

562
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,020
based in in Europe but they have data

563
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,240
locations in the US with regards to

564
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,520
different jurisdictions as there are a

565
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
lot otherwise it was different

566
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,059
challenges with regards to that and how

567
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,620
do you navigate that

568
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,460
okay so it is a challenge it's something

569
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,320
that has changed massively over the

570
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
years that that and encryption are

571
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,400
probably the two biggest challenges to

572
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,980
to forensic investigations because

573
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,720
previously you you seized the box there

574
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,299
was a hard drive in it you imaged it you

575
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,980
did a hash of it and it was never going

576
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,780
to change and you could prove somebody

577
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,100
else would come along and hash that

578
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,780
drive and get exactly the same value

579
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,400
you're not going to be able to do that

580
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,559
with volatile data like cloud data or

581
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,960
indeed mobile data

582
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,080
um so what you have to do is just

583
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,039
do a best effort at getting the data at

584
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,880
the time

585
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,220
and then hash it so that you can at

586
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,679
least show that you know that that copy

587
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,020
of it that you have if you give a copy

588
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,400
that somebody doesn't take it the same

589
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,559
hash in it but it is the same data that

590
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,140
you're giving evidence that you you

591
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,240
obtained from this particular Source

592
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,820
whatever that might be

593
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,620
slightly different but you still do your

594
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,780
your best efforts same thing reply to a

595
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,299
mobile device if you go into an Imaging

596
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,640
of a mobile device and you image the

597
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,780
same mobile device tomorrow you're going

598
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,740
to get a completely different hash

599
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,120
because you actually have to analyze the

600
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,620
device when it's live things are

601
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,539
changing on it it's never the same again

602
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,760
so those are challenges but they're not

603
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,640
insurmountable you just document what

604
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,900
you do and that's the most important

605
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,520
thing in in forensics you document

606
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,760
absolutely every step you take so that

607
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,039
if your challenge later on uh that you

608
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,500
you're not trying to recall oh God I

609
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,000
would have done it this way or I would

610
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,919
probably do it that way you can say no I

611
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,480
did it exactly one two three

612
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,720
thank you

613
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,829
[Applause]
