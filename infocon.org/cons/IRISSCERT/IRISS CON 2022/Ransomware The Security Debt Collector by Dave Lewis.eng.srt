1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,440
thank you very much and I don't have a

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,059
remote mic so this is going to be

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,800
interesting because I usually can't hold

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,139
still so oh bless your heart

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:19,220
check check oh all right

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,160
so all right let's start things off here

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,380
so my name is Dave Lewis and I am here

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,599
to talk about ransomware from the

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,060
perspective of not so much the software

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,759
itself but why it is a thing why it is

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,020
successful and um also I'd love to add a

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,640
little bit of local flavor wherever I go

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
so I was able to work that in if anybody

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,180
can tell me where that picture is from

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,739
I'd be very interested to hear it I

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,000
don't have a book to give away I didn't

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
write a book

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,020
um maybe one day I have half of a

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,700
coloring book that was done

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,200
so I've been doing Security in one form

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,059
of another for about three decades now

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,579
and it has actually been really an

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,739
amazing experience when I look back at

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,539
it for all the times that I freaked out

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,160
for all the times that I lost my

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
Collective cool I have really had the

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,439
benefit of having an amazing

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,659
interactions with communities like your

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,820
own uh giving talks around the world

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,560
which when I look back to the earlier

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
part of my career I never imagined I

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,820
would get to this point I remember

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,100
sitting in my cubicle in a power company

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,680
working away in a bank and never

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,060
imagined I would be doing stuff like

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,680
this because I never wanted to stand up

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,900
in front of people but I kept seeing

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,400
things happen in all the environments

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
that I worked in and security debt is

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,880
something that I like to talk about and

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,900
I will get into that a little bit more

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,540
in a bit as to why this has actually led

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,400
me to where I am today

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,220
so I like to identify myself as a hacker

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,299
but if you could do a quick search

46
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,100
online you find out that well not

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,979
everybody likes us very much

48
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,140
and I tend to have a great deal of

49
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,759
frustration with the way things are in

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,740
the world because we find ourselves

51
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,020
constantly running from threats

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,480
whether it's kinetic Warfare

53
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,799
[Music]

54
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,020
viruses all of these things really do

55
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,520
cause us a great deal of consternation

56
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,619
and I tend to be very laid back because

57
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,000
I am Canadian

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,439
sorry

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,780
and we um

60
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,300
really thought for a long time as a

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,220
country that we were immune to these

62
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,239
sort of things

63
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,340
and that was something that I've been

64
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,379
working with my compatriots in Canada to

65
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,379
dissuade them of this idea because there

66
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,400
have been so many times we've seen

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,660
government organizations financial

68
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,000
institutions and things like that being

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
compromised by external attackers and

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,420
they're like oh well they don't want

71
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,340
anything to do with us and the really

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,379
interesting thing about it is attackers

73
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,360
will come for anybody at this point if

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,520
you have an IP address you will come up

75
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
next in the sequence there was a time

76
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
where attackers would be going after you

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
because of your political Bend because

78
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
of what you did for an industry and so

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,340
on and so forth now it's just a numbers

80
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,560
game when you have tools that can scan

81
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,140
the entire internet in four hours or

82
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,360
less at this point it's really a numbers

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
game

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,540
and it's really amazing to see how we

85
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,640
got here as we go through time we see

86
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,019
all these different types of malicious

87
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,700
software and the one that really

88
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,280
absolutely gets to me is this one here

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,040
at the on the left side 1989 there was a

90
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,440
computer AIDS virus that came out this

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,060
was created by I believe is Dr Joseph

92
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,140
Papp did I get the name right yes and he

93
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
had created this malicious software that

94
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,280
he burned onto about 20 000 CDs that he

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,220
distributed to members of a healthcare

96
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,680
conference the idea here is they go home

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,480
installing their computer and after 99

98
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,700
times rebooting their computer this

99
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
malicious software would take hold and

100
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,019
in order to get the decryption key you

101
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,640
had to send a self-addressed stamped

102
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,360
envelope to a post office box in Panama

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,640
this was really quite literally the

104
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
first iteration of ransomware and as

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,019
we've gone through time we've seen how

106
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,200
that has changed we have seen banking

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,420
Trojans that are now focusing on

108
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,819
stealing money obviously because in the

109
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,980
beginning I remember Zone H and aldas

110
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,959
and all these various different

111
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,540
um and attrition where people say oh

112
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,780
greets to all my friends and this is the

113
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,519
sorry I have to collect myself Brian had

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,900
us out last night I'm a little bit slow

115
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,920
today

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,799
all right I'm back

117
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,959
and so now it has become very much a

118
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
large industry type thing and then they

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,220
have the evolution of things like

120
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,738
wannacry one thing that really amazed me

121
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,478
here is I was actually in a Hotel in Tel

122
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,160
Aviv the morning this news broke and I

123
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,419
woke up and I looked at the screen I was

124
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,400
like you got to be kidding me it was

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,139
using a vulnerability that was a known

126
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,300
issue for 10 years

127
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,460
this was a lingering issue that we had

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,820
known about for a decade

129
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,680
and then we go okay these are real

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,780
problems and then as we go through we

131
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,160
see other types of software like Samsung

132
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
where it was more targeted the attackers

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,199
were getting smarter they weren't just

134
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,820
spraying and hoping to get somebody to

135
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,259
click on it they were now targeting

136
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,360
folks somebody in Human Resources

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,100
somebody in finance somebody that's not

138
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,780
necessarily technically Droid not

139
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,120
technically Savvy the luddates the

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,259
people that just happen to have email

141
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,540
for work those are the people that they

142
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,820
tended to want to go after

143
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,280
and now we have gotten to the point

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,840
where there's so many data breaches

145
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,720
there are services like this Troy hunt

146
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,639
runs this site in Australia where you

147
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,020
could put in your email address and look

148
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,300
to see how many data breaches you've

149
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,919
been a part of

150
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,320
I did this for one of my throwaway email

151
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,960
addresses and I think if I lined up all

152
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,759
of my free credit monitoring I'm going

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,780
to be covered for the next couple

154
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,860
decades

155
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,539
it's absolutely staggering that we've

156
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,979
gotten to this point

157
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,039
there's a website out there called

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,520
informationisbeautiful.net if you ever

159
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,900
get a chance to look at it it's really

160
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
quite telling they take various types of

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
data sets and they crunch them down and

162
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
put them into a digital visualization so

163
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,940
that you can you know better understand

164
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,780
the data they also do this with data

165
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,780
breach information the crazy thing is

166
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,460
they've had to re-architect how they

167
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,800
present this data at least twice in the

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
last six years because it wouldn't all

169
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,340
fit on the screen

170
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,080
and the attackers continue to prey on

171
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,120
these sort of things they now have

172
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,180
bespoke malware that you can get there

173
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,699
is ransomware as a service they have

174
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,580
denial of service as a service these are

175
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,020
the things that absolutely blow my mind

176
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,020
I remember seeing this one platform that

177
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,539
was by a group called The Lizard Squad

178
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,100
and for a little bit of Bitcoin you

179
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,780
could sign in and you could launch a

180
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,160
denial service against whoever you

181
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,060
wanted

182
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,639
it was literally just click and go and

183
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
when your money was out then you can go

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,880
on your way but it was just absolutely

185
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,340
amazing but now these attacks have

186
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,199
really gotten to a much more

187
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,060
sophisticated point

188
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,120
the problem here is these attacks don't

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,380
always happen the way the attackers

190
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,880
intend

191
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,819
so in 2020 in September there was a

192
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,699
woman who unfortunately passed away

193
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,039
she was on route to a hospital in

194
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,840
Dusseldorf Germany

195
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
and unfortunately the hospital that she

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
was trying to go to had all of their

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
systems compromised or the vast majority

198
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,919
of their system compromised to the point

199
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,300
where they could no longer admit

200
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,620
patience

201
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,080
they had to reroute her ambulance to

202
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,139
another hospital 40 plus kilometers away

203
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,360
and unfortunately she expired in transit

204
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
now law enforcement there tried to um

205
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,660
sorry law enforcement there tried to

206
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,220
bring murder charges but they couldn't

207
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,020
track down who it was

208
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,180
the attackers offered up the decryption

209
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,099
key for free because they said oh our

210
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,840
mistake we didn't actually mean to go

211
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,220
after you

212
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,880
I don't really see how that is a good

213
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,319
defense by any stretch of the

214
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,680
imagination

215
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,080
now how does this happen

216
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,900
because like Miko was saying earlier

217
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,080
email we are conditioned to click on

218
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,500
links we are trained to click on links

219
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,479
and unfortunately as security

220
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,220
practitioners we do have a bad habit of

221
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,440
vilifying the users I know I've been

222
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,880
perfectly guilty of this over the course

223
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,400
of my career I'm feeling better now but

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,259
this is just it we have to find better

225
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,620
ways to provide empathy to really figure

226
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,259
out how we can get the message across to

227
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,720
our users without making them feel bad

228
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,660
about it because they'll come after us

229
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,639
the attackers that is with phishing

230
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,319
email links that something as simple as

231
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,520
this

232
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,520
or more more often that I get this is

233
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
they're coming at you with text messages

234
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,139
my daughter receives about six of these

235
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,240
a day because whoever had her phone

236
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,580
number before she got it uh basically

237
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,259
ducked out on every single debt they

238
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,180
ever had so she constantly gets messages

239
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,240
and all the sort and we screen capture

240
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,620
these because they're absolutely

241
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,620
fantastic for a historical purpose to go

242
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,360
back and look at and see you know this

243
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,219
is the way it used to be back in you

244
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,279
know 2020 to 2022.

245
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,459
foreign

246
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,040
so maybe my system gets compromised and

247
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
what's it going to really mean to me

248
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,700
well the numbers are going to continue

249
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,000
to pile up this is from a few years ago

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,700
this is a ransomware infection that cost

251
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,019
this particular company 20 260 000 U.S

252
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,640
and it's amazing when you look at and

253
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,380
say okay that wasn't that much at that

254
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,519
point in time now we're talking about

255
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,839
orders of magnitude and millions of

256
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:10,560
dollars

257
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
for a lot of us it's better now because

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,540
Bitcoin has actually dropped in value so

259
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,760
it's less less of a windfall for the

260
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,180
attackers but the Attack Base the

261
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,100
possible opportunities for the attackers

262
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,860
has expanded when you look at the fact

263
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,480
that most of our vehicles that we drive

264
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,640
today are computers with wheels we have

265
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,500
to realize that we got to do better at

266
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,779
protecting our systems because we're

267
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,120
doing this at a faster and faster rate

268
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,519
and security is not necessarily being

269
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,440
factored in

270
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,180
now there are consistent themes that we

271
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,620
have to be aware of when we're dealing

272
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,880
with the attackers coming after us you

273
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,339
know user-focused phishing emails how

274
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,600
they're coming at you primarily

275
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,480
targeting apps that you would use but

276
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,339
as Mika was talking about earlier we're

277
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,019
moving more and more to a browser-based

278
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,360
culture but the browsers are susceptible

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,740
as well

280
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,540
and these data breaches will keep

281
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,339
happening until we start doing a better

282
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,080
job

283
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,700
case in point we have various different

284
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,680
types of reports out there Verizon DBI

285
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,320
or and others where 81 on average it

286
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,820
fluctuates a one percent here and there

287
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,700
year over year of uh data breaches

288
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,640
involve weak credentials

289
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,940
or 70 and compromised devices

290
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,519
if I had a dollar for every time I saw a

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,620
data breach notification that had a

292
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,899
laptop that was stolen from the trunk of

293
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,459
a car but it's okay it was password

294
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,779
protected

295
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,580
these are the kind of things that keep

296
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,560
me up at night because this is a defined

297
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,540
repeatable Behavior

298
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,459
we have to really figure out a way to

299
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,260
break that habit

300
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,820
because when an attacker breaks into

301
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,040
your site and steals these credentials

302
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,019
if they're using them against your site

303
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,720
and you've been compromised how do you

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
know that they're the credentials that

305
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,380
are not supposed to be there how do you

306
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,700
know that the person coming in is the

307
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
one that should not be there if they're

308
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,720
using legitimate credentials I've seen

309
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
many different reports out there say oh

310
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,019
it's 200 days before a company knows

311
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,760
they've been breached what if it's 24

312
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,940
hours what if it's an hour how much

313
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,440
damage could they do in that very short

314
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,180
space of time

315
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,399
we have to look at better ways to do

316
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,079
things we have to look at strategies

317
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,000
that we can employ in order to reduce

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,519
the risk for our organizations

319
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,800
zero trust love it or hate it as a term

320
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm not a big fan of the term

321
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,519
really talks to risk reduction how we

322
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,500
can better improve Security in our

323
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,060
environment because we're looking at all

324
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,140
the things that we should have been

325
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,120
doing for the last 30 years

326
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,399
Network Zone segmentation better user

327
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,040
management Asset Management all of these

328
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,680
things we have to get better at because

329
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,420
if we're not protecting the users

330
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,160
devices and applications we need in

331
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
order to keep our business running the

332
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,459
attackers are going to constantly keep

333
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,079
coming at you because they're going to

334
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,180
look for new and exciting ways to get in

335
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,920
my previous job one of the interview

336
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,720
questions was how would I hack that

337
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,959
company I said simple I take the CEOs

338
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,880
and men out for lunch

339
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,399
I said what I said yes I would ask for

340
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,140
their password what if they don't give

341
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,699
you a password I have a brick

342
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,920
we have to really look at it from

343
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,300
different perspectives because we can't

344
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,920
just say we have a firewall everything

345
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,019
is fine and move on from there we have

346
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,339
to get inside the mindset of the

347
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,839
attacker because the attacker is coming

348
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,579
after you looking for that low-hanging

349
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,339
fruit that we have presented them and we

350
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,860
do make mistakes when I first moved into

351
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,720
my first apartment in high and

352
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,760
University one of the first things I did

353
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,260
was I grabbed a pair of scissors I went

354
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,760
running around the apartment

355
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,680
my roommate looks at me are you out of

356
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,820
your mind

357
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,100
I said well you know this is my you know

358
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,019
rebelling against my parents and all the

359
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,339
rest of it and they said were they

360
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,860
really that bad I said no but I just

361
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,660
felt like it was a sense of freedom and

362
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,240
he says what if you trip it's like oh I

363
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,980
hadn't really thought that through and

364
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,899
this is really analogous to a lot of the

365
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,820
things we do in Security in that it

366
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,339
seemed like a good idea at the time but

367
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,040
not so much for example we have this

368
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,300
wonderful thing where we love to be

369
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,740
environmentally friendly we'd love to

370
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
recycle unfortunately as humans we tend

371
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,019
to recycle our passwords and this is

372
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,639
much to our own detriment because the

373
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,260
attackers know this so when they

374
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,700
compromise the site they will then take

375
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,139
those credentials and replay them

376
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,740
against other sites to get more access

377
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,959
and the reason that all of this works is

378
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,339
because when we're born into this world

379
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,139
we default to trust

380
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,880
Malcolm Gladwell talked about this book

381
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,500
and talked about this in his book

382
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,959
talking to strangers where that is how

383
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,279
we are born in this world we are looking

384
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,380
for food we're looking for shelter we

385
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,560
are looking for safety and unfortunately

386
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,320
most of us never get past that from a

387
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,940
security perspective

388
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,100
and we just assume that everything is

389
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,680
going to be fine because we have in that

390
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
innate Trust

391
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,040
and that is where we end up with

392
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,839
security debt because we have a trust

393
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,760
that our systems are going to be fine we

394
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,800
have a trust that our technology which

395
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,260
has brought us to wonderful places is

396
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,579
going to be okay

397
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,800
but the problem is is that's not really

398
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
the case attackers are constantly

399
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
looking for new and exciting ways to

400
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,480
cause us headaches

401
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,579
and for me the way I Define security

402
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,440
debt is a technological debt that has

403
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,959
manifested as a security issue either by

404
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:12,899
time or interaction with other systems

405
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,480
and when it does come to fruition it's

406
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,519
absolutely staggering the damage that

407
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
can be done

408
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,120
heart bleed is a great example of this

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,940
this is about eight years ago now but

410
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,160
this was a library that was used on

411
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,380
every e-commerce site on the planet and

412
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,940
the team that was maintaining this at

413
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,160
that time was 1.5 people

414
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,139
not half a person but half time

415
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,579
every company in the world and nobody

416
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,440
was chipping in that has been remedied

417
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,320
but this is just one example of many all

418
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,699
of these open source libraries that

419
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,500
companies are using in order to do their

420
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,320
work they're not necessarily inputting

421
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,820
they're just trusting everything's going

422
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,779
to be fine

423
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,339
so we have to make sure we're doing a

424
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,019
better job of pitching in

425
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,590
I always got to work in the coffee break

426
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,180
[Music]

427
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,360
so we got to this point because of our

428
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
appetite for risk and how we handle risk

429
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,339
we've avoided accepted reduced transfer

430
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,380
the thing that always gets me is we

431
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,540
accepted the risk have you ever heard of

432
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,139
a uh podcast uh host unknown

433
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,000
anybody ever heard that one all right

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,560
cool if you haven't go look them up

435
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,839
there are quite quite amusing but they

436
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,519
have this one song that they put

437
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,139
together about accepting the risk

438
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,240
because far too often organizations just

439
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,940
that's okay we accepted that risk

440
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,339
all right great you accepted that risk

441
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,440
in 2017 have you gone back to look at it

442
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,959
it is now 2022.

443
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
oh no it's okay we accepted that risk

444
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,279
and these are the things that really

445
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,899
keep me up at night because I've lived

446
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,220
through this in other organizations I

447
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,839
spent 20 years as a Defender before

448
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,240
crossing over into the vendor space and

449
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
I remember times where we had reports

450
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
and I presented them to the board and

451
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,880
they said oh it's okay we've got a

452
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,980
firewall it's okay we have antivirus

453
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,240
we're fine

454
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,980
and they really missed the bigger

455
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,720
picture as to what the potential impact

456
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
was what the risk to the organization

457
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
was what is that expectation of loss

458
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,720
because bad things continue to happen

459
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
I have been in many organizations over

460
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,519
the years either by full-time or as a

461
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,279
contractor and the one thing that always

462
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,100
gets me is the beige desktop running

463
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,959
Mission critical code

464
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,779
written by a summer student that is

465
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,060
undocumented and if they pull the plug

466
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,420
the system will fall fail

467
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,240
this whenever I do CSO roundtables and

468
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,259
I've been doing them basically on

469
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,639
average one a week for the last two and

470
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,199
a half years whenever I bring this up

471
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,360
they're like yeah we got one of those

472
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,940
and it is so pervasive that it's

473
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,100
absolutely boggling to my mind as we

474
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,779
move over to you know cloud-based

475
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,000
systems which have their ups and downs

476
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,980
of course unfortunately a lot of times

477
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,259
we'll see the lift and shift mentality

478
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,180
of taking these systems and go oh just

479
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,259
put it in the cloud is the Cloud's

480
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,519
problem now

481
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,799
but how do we manage that risk we need

482
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
to do a better job of this and how are

483
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,220
you going to quantify it how are you

484
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,559
going to measure it and figure out ways

485
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,599
to improve

486
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,520
so one of the things that we do at Cisco

487
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,319
is we have a couple of reports that we

488
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
put out and one of them is a security

489
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,040
outcome study this is freely available

490
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,720
to anybody it's not a vendor pitch kind

491
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
of thing where we actually went out and

492
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,880
talked to about 5 500 security companies

493
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,860
and got their perspective on how they

494
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,000
did things

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,740
and a really funny thing was the first

496
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,820
time I heard about this report

497
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,340
internally I said oh great a vendor

498
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,900
report we're just gonna hear about it

499
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,460
from everybody

500
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,160
but no this was a double blind

501
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
and all of a sudden I was like oh really

502
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,179
this is interesting so it was really

503
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,559
amazing to go through and have

504
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,179
conversations with organizations and

505
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,700
seeing how they were handling security

506
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,020
one of the really interesting little

507
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,179
things that they did was they were able

508
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,580
to reduce the risk in their organization

509
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,160
by doing regular Tech refreshes

510
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,840
obviously that's not going to work for

511
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,160
every organization because there's a

512
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,200
significant cost involved but there are

513
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,760
different ways to approach it is the

514
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,900
idea

515
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,520
and when they're looking at these sort

516
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,919
of changes we're looking at how are

517
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,539
they're vendor driven or if they're

518
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,000
driven internally are the reactive

519
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
proactive we went through all of this

520
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,360
data analysis and it was really amazing

521
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,460
to see all these different perspectives

522
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,500
and the one thing that came out over and

523
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,480
over again was ease of integration

524
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
because people don't want to do the hard

525
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
things anymore they don't want to manage

526
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,940
their own mail servers they don't want

527
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,520
to run their own personal websites I

528
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,960
know I've been down that road and we're

529
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
running your own mail server pales in

530
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,740
comparison to managing your own split

531
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,600
Horizon DNS

532
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm feeling better now

533
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,039
another report that we do is called The

534
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,360
Trusted access report now this is a

535
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,340
cover from last year's but we just had

536
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,700
the new report come out 10 days ago and

537
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,679
what we did here is we looked at all of

538
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,919
the authentications for duo security and

539
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,360
we went through there and looked at how

540
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,559
they were being handled within

541
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,539
organizations around the world and it

542
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,799
was amazing what we did the trending

543
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,080
analysis over the last few years and we

544
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,080
saw that there was a noticeable dip from

545
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,440
2020 right through until very recently

546
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
and a lot of this really tarkens back to

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
companies were doing their best to try

548
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,320
and make sure they were keeping the

549
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,500
lights on they shifted very quickly to

550
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,340
remote workforces because pandemic

551
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,320
and a lot of companies I spoke to they

552
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
made risk-based decisions that are like

553
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,039
okay we're just going to do this and go

554
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,000
with it because we got to keep the

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
lights on

556
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,059
One Call Center that I dealt with in

557
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,820
Southeast Asia they had only desktops

558
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,260
for all their support team they

559
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,000
literally packaged all the desktops the

560
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,160
monitors and ship them home because it

561
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,380
was their only option there was no way

562
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,360
they could go out and get laptops for

563
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,160
everybody you know just going by the

564
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,660
local store and get a bunch of laptops

565
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,760
that doesn't scale although I've seen

566
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,179
that in more Dr planning documents than

567
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,059
I care to admit Dr planning documents

568
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,919
and BCB documents are always we'll go to

569
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,900
the shop and buy a bunch of laptops if

570
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,340
every organization is doing that that'll

571
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,900
burn out real fast

572
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,059
or the other one uh smoking hole

573
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,140
scenario

574
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,179
where the Creator or the crater that

575
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,679
used to be your building was hit by a

576
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,380
meteor if a meteor hits your building

577
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,720
there's a high probability that laptops

578
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,940
are the last of your concerns

579
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,380
but it's really interesting when you

580
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,059
look at it on a country by country basis

581
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,160
on who has all those laptops and

582
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,320
desktops if you see here in the top in

583
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120
the top three Ireland is in third place

584
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
where on average we're looking at about

585
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,620
four devices per person for people that

586
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,720
are doing their authentications

587
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,640
and when you're looking at these sort of

588
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
things and you're realizing all of these

589
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,299
different devices that yes there are

590
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,039
some things like tablets in that word a

591
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
closed system but you also have laptops

592
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,179
that they're you have running Linux you

593
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,500
have running over other operating

594
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,419
systems that are potentially vulnerable

595
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,080
so it's a very wide footprint where

596
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,120
giving opportunities for attackers to

597
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,500
cause all sorts of trouble

598
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,660
[Music]

599
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,700
and then we look at it by industry

600
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,380
vertical and in this particular case we

601
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,080
went by browser diversity and the

602
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,120
browsers while we're moving more and

603
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,500
more to that

604
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,600
in finance you'll see them keeping a

605
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
tight leash on that and they'll have you

606
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,020
know One browser that they standardize

607
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,780
on but if you move over to education wow

608
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,520
it's absolutely staggering all the

609
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,780
different browser types that they have

610
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,700
especially when you look at some of the

611
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,679
browsers that they're running are

612
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,140
deprecated they have not been patched in

613
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,179
a very very long time

614
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,159
and then you look at it from who's

615
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,200
running Java still

616
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,179
and it's really amazing to see how many

617
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:34,919
organizations are still running down of

618
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,580
them

619
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,860
but not nearly as amazing as this

620
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,679
this report came out on November 1st of

621
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
this year and this is from data from the

622
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,299
last year there are current companies

623
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,720
out there that are still running Flash

624
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,440
even Adobe killed it so make sure you're

625
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
going through your systems going through

626
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,240
your networks looking what do you have

627
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,380
what are you protecting in your

628
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,000
organization

629
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
do you know what you have so many times

630
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,679
I've had conversations with customers I

631
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
say hello how many uh servers of this do

632
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,919
you have how many of this how many a

633
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,120
bunch

634
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,340
that's usually a bit of a red flag for

635
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,459
me

636
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,080
and we have to look at better ways of

637
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
doing authentication to make sure that

638
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,700
we are having a more you know cohesive

639
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
message because passwords are

640
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,659
effectively a house key it does nothing

641
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,640
to be sure of who's coming through the

642
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,720
front door

643
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,400
you can lock your stuff you can leave

644
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,960
but if an attacker finds it a criminal

645
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,720
finds your key they can get in the key

646
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,820
the lock doesn't care

647
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,919
we have to look at ways that we can say

648
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,020
how do we value work we have to look at

649
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,480
it from a human element perspective we

650
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,740
want to make sure that when we are

651
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,900
dealing with security we are looking at

652
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,400
not only the security debt of the

653
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,539
systems that we need to patch the

654
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,520
systems we need to maintain but the

655
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
people if we are not taking the time to

656
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,740
properly educate the people we are going

657
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,480
to have ourselves a bigger bigger

658
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
problem because the attack the attacker

659
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
the attackers go after the people case

660
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,100
in point when I had that interview and

661
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,360
they asked me how I break into the

662
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,220
company I didn't say going after the

663
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,419
systems because I knew I'd never get

664
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,400
through the front door that way I went

665
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
after the human element

666
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
but the way we can improve that is using

667
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,679
good user ux design if a user can use

668
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,500
your software or your systems in a way

669
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,440
that is easy for them to understand

670
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,419
you're going to get much further because

671
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,700
for example I've got my 77 year old

672
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,380
mother using multi-factor authentication

673
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,720
for her accounts she used to use the

674
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
same password for her cat's name on

675
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
everything I won't say witchcat but

676
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,520
suffice to say that has been dealt with

677
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,200
but that's just one of the examples we

678
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
need to look at how we can democratize

679
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,820
security and make sure that we are doing

680
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,220
a better job because just saying here's

681
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,900
this tool written by Engineers for

682
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,520
engineers and hoping that somebody in

683
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,900
finance is going to know how to use it

684
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,020
is not doing security that is causing

685
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,240
more problems than solving

686
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,539
because we can patch humans we can do a

687
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,460
better job and we have to figure out

688
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,280
ways that we can teach differently you

689
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,500
want to empower those users you want to

690
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,360
give them a reason to care about

691
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,440
security

692
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,659
were born in this world we default to

693
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,179
trust but we have to make sure that they

694
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:22,980
understand that not everyone is

695
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,380
trustworthy

696
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,700
and for those of you taking pictures

697
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,620
these will be available for slides later

698
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,500
so you can

699
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,640
so you want to make sure that you are

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,500
being consistent in your message when

701
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,020
you are talking to family when you're

702
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,520
talking to employees when you're talking

703
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,320
to co-workers you want to make sure you

704
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,659
have a consistent message and not one of

705
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,640
fear uncertainty and doubt

706
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,220
yes never waste a good

707
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,520
um headline article but make sure that

708
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,100
you're using it in the right way don't

709
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,020
say haha look what happened to them say

710
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,120
okay that's what happened let's look at

711
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,620
our system and say okay would this

712
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,080
happen to us

713
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,700
you want to make sure that you are

714
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,039
getting into security awareness and

715
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,299
making sure you're going through and

716
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,100
having to find repeatable processes you

717
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,539
want to make sure you're building up the

718
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,940
users in one organization I used to work

719
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,340
at one of the things that we did was we

720
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,860
had the ability for people to email us

721
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,360
and say we found this particular

722
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,220
vulnerability or this particular

723
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,960
software is not up to the latest

724
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,820
revision and they send it into our

725
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,140
information security team and we're like

726
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,240
okay great we'd send them back an email

727
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,860
saying thank you for pointing this out

728
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,580
and copy their boss

729
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,039
this rapidly became currency because

730
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,159
people were using this to help negotiate

731
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,200
their raises to help negotiate their

732
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,480
next role within the organization they

733
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,700
saw the value-add proposition it wasn't

734
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,860
a case of here's a 10 gift card to the

735
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,260
local coffee shop no no they that had

736
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,779
real tangible value for them and all of

737
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,480
a sudden everybody was engaged because

738
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
they saw that value and they understood

739
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,980
that there was something in it for them

740
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,659
and quite selfishly there was something

741
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,100
in it for the organization as well

742
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,500
because we got better security

743
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,059
and when you're looking at your security

744
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,039
awareness training don't just rattle

745
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,200
something off and hope for the best you

746
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
want to make sure that your questions

747
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,140
that you have and you're looking at your

748
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,520
time periods of violations and things

749
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,380
like that you're going through this and

750
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,900
looking at what it matters to you

751
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,940
one organization I used to work at

752
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,799
somebody came in from the infosec

753
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,000
Department this was when I was in

754
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
networks and they tried to get me fired

755
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,059
because of Twitter of all things

756
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,980
what I had done is I had opened up a

757
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,600
browser with Twitter in it and I'd gone

758
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,880
off to meetings for the day and it kept

759
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,400
refreshing once every minute

760
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,380
I was told that I would launch the

761
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,840
denial of service internally

762
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,539
and I was like wow this was also the

763
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,279
same person that told me the only ports

764
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,679
you ever needed to scan were from 1 to

765
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,659
10 24 because nobody actually had

766
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,419
registered ports above 1024. so you can

767
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,159
imagine the kind of

768
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,740
pain and suffering I had to deal with

769
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,020
we have to constantly look at everything

770
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,820
in our environment we will have to make

771
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,320
sure that we are looking at things like

772
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,419
patch level operating systems disk

773
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,520
encryption firewalls all stuff that

774
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,400
should be common sense

775
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,140
but do you know the posture of your

776
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,360
devices we have to make sure that we're

777
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,799
going through and iterating through this

778
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,200
because passwords are one of the easiest

779
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
ways for attackers to get in

780
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,980
on average most organizations have about

781
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,779
1400 different platforms that are using

782
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:27,360
to authenticate and the average user has

783
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,120
190 passwords they use personally in my

784
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,620
own password manager I have over a

785
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,179
thousand different sets of credentials

786
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,919
there's no way I could ever remember

787
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,200
those so we have to make sure that we're

788
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,480
doing a better job because passwords can

789
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,919
be used for credential stuffing they can

790
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,659
be used for reuse phishing all these

791
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:45,539
sort of things it is a dead

792
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,700
control I won't even call it a security

793
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,659
control

794
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,659
it is limited value

795
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:52,980
we want to make sure that we're going

796
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,960
through and doing the best we can of

797
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
updating our operating systems making

798
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,720
sure we have better ways of doing

799
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,960
authentication are your browsers updated

800
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,720
are they the current or n minus one do

801
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,700
they align with the security profile and

802
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,260
the risk profile of your organization

803
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,000
are you making teddy bears or

804
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,340
centrifuges

805
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,659
you want to make sure that you're going

806
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,000
through and having proper Dr and BCP

807
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,320
testing you want to make sure you're

808
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,299
performing tests to ensure that

809
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,919
everything is valid and you're not doing

810
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,480
it to vilify the people in your

811
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,580
organization you're doing it to shore up

812
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,840
your defenses

813
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,640
you want to also make sure that when

814
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,620
you're doing all of this that you have

815
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,200
good backups one company I used to work

816
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
at we had great backups we did take

817
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,100
backups we put them on the truck we sent

818
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,760
them off to a secure location every day

819
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,279
small problem I got there I've been

820
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,140
there for about a week I said have we

821
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,880
tested the backups

822
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,760
what oh they'll just work

823
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,159
bare metal system got in some of the

824
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,860
tapes we found out that we lost one of

825
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,480
every four tapes we sent over don't know

826
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,279
whatever became of those we couldn't

827
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,980
restore anything for tape we had been

828
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,220
doing this for years as an organization

829
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,900
we have to make sure we're doing a

830
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,039
better job

831
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,860
look at ways that you can work on the

832
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,440
human element within your organization

833
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,940
it may seem odd to say that as a

834
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,640
security debt issue but is very much so

835
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,919
we have always as security practitioners

836
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,620
focused on the technology we have to

837
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,140
make sure that we focus on the people

838
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,140
because without this we're going to be

839
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,179
in a much worse position than we are now

840
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,080
in lieu of the fact that I'm running

841
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,179
very short on time here I want to say

842
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,860
thank you very much for everyone being

843
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,299
here I really do appreciate the

844
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,159
opportunity to be back here again thank

845
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,440
you for the hangover Brian and if you

846
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
have any questions I'd be more than

847
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,080
willing to take them for the next 30

848
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,820
seconds

849
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,939
thank you

850
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,600
yes

851
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,440
I've I've worked in two counts in six

852
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,480
countries and it's always the basics

853
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,059
yeah yeah sorry yeah sorry yeah the rest

854
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,260
of the audience yeah it's always the

855
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,640
basics I really loved I loved the

856
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,559
message it was it was brilliant

857
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,120
um oh sorry

858
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,020
um no yeah I really really like the

859
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,539
message it was the basics Basics Basics

860
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,399
Basics it's exactly it's the same thing

861
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,720
all the time

862
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,220
um the question actually I had was more

863
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,220
of a Cisco question so I recently did up

864
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,340
uh I'm with UCD and you know I did a

865
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,860
report and I was looking at like the

866
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,299
amount of threats we're going to have

867
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,299
with IP version seven or version Six

868
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,799
coming out

869
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,520
um so we're going from you know to 2.4

870
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,000
billion to

871
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,740
340 trillion trillion trillion IP

872
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,840
addresses and I found a great statistic

873
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,659
it's more IP addresses that every grain

874
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,640
of sand on the Earth

875
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,279
like how are we going to defend against

876
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,860
that well again this is why we have to

877
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,539
have a proper strategy we have to look

878
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,980
at it from a larger perspective of

879
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,419
saying not just worrying about Point

880
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,980
Solutions not worrying about you know

881
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,500
how we're going to extend that having a

882
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,360
clear path to making sure we're securing

883
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,860
all those devices because if we look

884
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,779
throughout Asia like one of the benefits

885
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,399
I have of my job is I get to travel the

886
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:12,659
world and I see different perspective

887
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,419
throughout Asia IPv6 is already a thing

888
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:17,520
it is all over the place here in North

889
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,360
America not so much but just by virtual

890
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,380
the fact they're changing it it's going

891
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,320
to make it easier to deploy things and

892
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,659
yes when you add in that and iot and all

893
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,240
those various other elements we're going

894
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,399
to have a much larger attack surface so

895
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,520
I don't blame IPv6 for that I blame the

896
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,320
systems for not being patched to current

897
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,659
n minus one as opposed to the user to

898
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,000
want to make sure that as vendors and

899
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,220
we're one as well we have to do a better

900
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,020
job of patching and we do have a huge

901
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,000
push internally with our or within our

902
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,039
own organization to get ahead of this

903
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,080
because this you're right this will get

904
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,039
worse before it gets better

905
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,860
because the the gsma has recently pushed

906
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,880
an iot law in the UK that that kills

907
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,980
default passwords which we did in in I

908
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,720
was in vote form for years and years and

909
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,299
years so we finally got rid of the

910
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,159
standard zero zero zeros the sim card

911
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,500
password like yeah it took us a long

912
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,779
time to do that but it did this those

913
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,179
kind of Basics that that you know we

914
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,299
need to work as an industry I think to I

915
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,860
agree completely especially like in

916
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,179
control systems we have a lot of

917
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,860
organizations out there vendors that

918
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,299
would have default credentials built

919
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,220
into their systems but there was no

920
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,260
mechanism or no way to force the users

921
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,000
of those systems to change that on

922
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,279
initial login like programmatically it's

923
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,320
a trivial exercise to have it set set a

924
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
fresh password as soon as it boots up so

925
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,059
there is no good reason why that

926
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,340
shouldn't have that initial prompt and

927
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,659
make sure that they actually set a

928
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:49,980
proper password as opposed to default

929
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,960
credentials like there's a group out of

930
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,120
Germany called finlet I probably got the

931
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,620
name butchered there but they had a

932
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,940
default password credential file they

933
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,880
used to publish and it stag figuring how

934
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,020
many of them still work today

935
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,520
well in lieu of the fact I'm running

936
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,200
over here uh thank you very much and I

937
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,340
really appreciate the opportunity to be

938
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,178
here have a great day
