1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,620
hi everybody uh I'm not two people James

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,420
so be up after me

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,880
um so thanks very much and I think Brian

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,440
put us on near the end of the day

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,120
because we wanted the really hardcore

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,740
people who are really interested in this

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,539
so thanks for staying

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,160
um so look we're going to cover a few

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,420
things

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,980
first up I'm going to cover an overview

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
of the Cyber threat landscape as we see

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,480
it in the NCSE with a particular focus

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,279
on how it's evolved since we launched

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,980
our strategy at the end of 2019 and the

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,480
reason I'm doing that is because we're

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,100
currently reviewing that strategy and

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,180
we'll be going out to public

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,219
consultation asking you industry

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
Community what do you think about our

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,820
proposed review of the strategy because

21
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,100
we still have two more than two years

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,600
left and I think we can do a little bit

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
more

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,140
um so first off I'm just going to give

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,480
you an overview of the NCSE uh you know

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,739
a lot of people don't know who we are

27
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,180
and we're trying to change that we're

28
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,260
trying to get out there a bit more

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,899
explain who we are and what we do so

30
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,100
um thanks Brian for the opportunity

31
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,379
today so our mission the mission of the

32
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,440
ncsc is uh to lead in enhancing the

33
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,820
security of essential networks and

34
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,260
information systems in the State against

35
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,540
cyber threat facilitating a free open

36
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,880
secure stable uh digitally consistent

37
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,799
for the people of Ireland so obviously a

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,540
very lofty Mission there

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,100
um and you know it's something we think

40
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,600
about a lot when we do our work in the

41
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,759
NCSE but one of the key points there is

42
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,799
we see ourselves as leading but we're

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,500
not the ones doing that's you guys on

44
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,180
the front on the front lines are the

45
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,040
cold face every day and we're there to

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,140
try and support and help you as well as

47
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,479
giving direct support then to to our

48
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,680
government and critical infrastructure

49
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,820
partners

50
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,860
how we do what we do with a few main

51
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,600
functions one of the first ones is

52
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,759
incident detection and response that's

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,079
where we kind of came from we were

54
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,700
originally the government Caesar

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
Community security instant response team

56
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,299
we have additional functions now with

57
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,100
risk analysis and situational awareness

58
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,200
so trying to understand what the Cyber

59
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,060
threat landscape is and and getting that

60
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,220
information out there engagement our

61
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,259
lead up ncsc engagement team so a big

62
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,000
part of that is reaching out to our

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,439
partners in government critical

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,500
infrastructure business Community

65
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,479
citizens and The Wider public

66
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,160
um cyber resilience is a big part of

67
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,479
what we do and we do that in a couple of

68
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,160
ways we have a compliance team that

69
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,840
looks after oversight of the news

70
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
directive and we have a new

71
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,680
certification team and then capacity

72
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,420
development my colleague James is going

73
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,620
to get into that a little bit at the end

74
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,060
of the presentation

75
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,980
so without getting into too much detail

76
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,239
this is how we're set up we have two

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,860
main directorates we've a directorate of

78
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,620
operations and a resilience directorate

79
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,680
um in in Risk in operations that's

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,959
mainly instant response risk operations

81
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,280
is kind of future facing stuff

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,260
vulnerability management some kind of

83
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,819
active cyber defense that type of thing

84
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,980
uh engineering then it looks after all

85
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,140
of our tools and technology and then on

86
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,400
the the resilient side of the house you

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,780
have my team the engagement team and

88
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,040
obviously we work very closely with

89
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,080
operations with capacity development

90
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,340
which James will talk about with

91
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,080
compliance and with members of our

92
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
compliance team here today so I'm sure

93
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,959
some of you have met them and they're

94
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,519
out there checking to make sure critical

95
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,440
infrastructure is taking a minimum set

96
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,180
of security measures we have

97
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,040
certifications so that's about setting

98
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,140
standards the Baseline that people will

99
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,879
do and then very soon we hope to be

100
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,280
certifying them businesses across the

101
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,560
country uh to uh to a process that

102
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,940
they're meeting a minimum amount of

103
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,739
cyber security and then finally project

104
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,780
management they're the people who make

105
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,459
us fill out off the charts to make sure

106
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,840
we're keeping things on track and that

107
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,000
we're spending your money wisely

108
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,340
so on to what I came here to talk about

109
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,720
which is an overview of the threat

110
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,700
landscape and as I said

111
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,500
I wanted to look at it in the context of

112
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,420
how things have changed since our

113
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,580
strategy at the end of 2019 we're just

114
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,140
shy of three years since this document

115
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,239
was published and I think you know we

116
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,459
can all focus in on the day-to-day of

117
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,840
cyber security and sometimes we forget

118
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,459
about how much things have changed in

119
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,620
such a short period so in that three

120
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
years obviously covet wasn't a thing

121
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,060
when the strategy was written or it was

122
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,159
just starting to be a thing in uh in in

123
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,680
Wuhan uh

124
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,019
the rise of ransomware so ransomware has

125
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,580
become so ubiquitous today we kind of

126
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,780
think it's always been there and while

127
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,879
it's been around for a long time it

128
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,980
really wasn't the same problem back when

129
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,180
this strategy was written and actually

130
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,739
the word ransomware doesn't even appear

131
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,360
in the strategy which would obviously be

132
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,879
Unthinkable today uh we hadn't suffered

133
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,500
the massive HSC attack here in this

134
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,080
country so that how we think about cyber

135
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,580
security in Ireland was obviously very

136
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,440
different and of course Russia hadn't

137
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,298
invaded Ukraine so there's some major

138
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,699
shifts that we've seen uh in the recent

139
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,979
past and I've got to step through how we

140
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,360
see the threat landscape as it is now

141
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,880
and how it's evolved uh so in terms of

142
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,979
vulnerabilities again nothing new here

143
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,080
we've been talking about computer bugs

144
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,540
since the top the term was coined I

145
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,940
think back in 1947 in Harvard Labs or so

146
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,880
the myth goes uh when a moth landed on

147
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
uh some circuit but the number of

148
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
vulnerabilities is increasing

149
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
um in 2021 there was 21

150
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,560
000 uh vulnerabilities disclosed uh so

151
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,900
that's an absolutely massive uh and and

152
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,340
really unconquerable amount of

153
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,740
vulnerabilities to patch

154
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,840
um but that's really a function of

155
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,240
there's more software there's more

156
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,080
digitization there's more people looking

157
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,580
at the code discovering vulnerabilities

158
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,800
but what's been really concerning is the

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,419
increase in zero day vulnerabilities so

160
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,160
the amount of vulnerabilities that no

161
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
patch is yet available for and that are

162
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,820
discovered in the wild essentially and

163
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,880
2021 was a record year there was 66 zero

164
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,979
day vulnerabilities discovered and this

165
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,660
room knows all about them if you were

166
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,360
dealing with Microsoft Exchange or print

167
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,919
nightmare having nightmares about those

168
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,060
things you know exactly what I'm talking

169
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,900
about

170
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,639
what's also happening is you're seeing

171
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
an increased speed of weaponization so

172
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,740
from when a vulnerability is discovered

173
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,419
when there's an exploit available that

174
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,100
that time is reducing and it's down to

175
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,560
about eight days now which is you know

176
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,360
the average obviously there's times when

177
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
that's only hours so on trivial exploits

178
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,100
like log4j if it's so easy to exploit

179
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,900
within hours people had exploit code for

180
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,100
it

181
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
um and and really what the point of

182
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,520
trying to make here is is you need to

183
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,340
focus on prioritization and something

184
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,080
our colleagues in the US have have

185
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,600
launched in the last year or so is the

186
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,639
known exploited vulnerability catalog so

187
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,979
you prioritize not based on just how

188
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,360
serious the vulnerability what is of

189
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,919
being actively exploited by the bad guys

190
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,560
and that reduced that 21 000

191
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,740
vulnerability list down to 138 in in

192
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,840
2021 that are on that list and that

193
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,220
suddenly becomes a much more manageable

194
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,660
thing to focus on we're not saying

195
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,979
forget about the others but at least

196
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,419
they're the ones that you need to patch

197
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,419
and Patch now

198
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,400
uh looking at criminal actors what we've

199
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,500
seen since the strategy uh came out is

200
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
is further increased specialization

201
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,360
sophistication and collaboration there's

202
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,400
no longer the one-man band like our

203
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,780
colleague who won the hacking

204
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,880
competition today it's it's teams of

205
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,660
people who focus in on specific areas of

206
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,120
uh of the the criminal ecosystem so you

207
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,620
don't have someone who's doing initial

208
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,600
exploit all the way to exfiltration of

209
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,340
data but you have as people who focus on

210
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,960
initial access you people who focus on

211
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
malware development people who focus on

212
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,319
um on crypto uh crypto malware and so on

213
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,240
and that specialization has allowed

214
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,699
Ransom actors to get our criminal actors

215
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,440
get really really good at what they do

216
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,780
and and they're sort of a web of people

217
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,520
who interact with each other in a mix

218
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,800
and match fashion like a gig economy and

219
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,419
that and it's really becoming like the

220
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,520
kind of startup SME culture that you

221
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,259
have on the the software development

222
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,580
side

223
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,500
um and I have a point they're saying uh

224
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,600
crime is going is migrating to the cloud

225
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,919
so we all hear a lot about all of our

226
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
business this is migrating to the cloud

227
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,160
so with the criminal actors and I mean

228
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,080
that in two senses one is they're

229
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,699
targeting Cloud much more often we're

230
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,139
seeing much more attacks on products

231
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,500
like Azure Office 365 on containers that

232
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,599
are misconfigured misconfigured S3

233
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,580
buckets and so on and that means we need

234
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,680
to be specialized in those areas but as

235
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
well as that they're migrating they're

236
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,380
literally migrating to the cloud their

237
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,520
infrastructure in the cloud they're

238
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
using the flexibility the scalability

239
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
putting up infrastructure pulling it

240
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,979
down moving it around the world and it

241
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,500
makes it much more challenging to track

242
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,360
and a subset of criminal actors is

243
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
obviously ransomware actors and and it

244
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,720
continues to be the highest threat as we

245
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,660
see it uh and and that threat you know

246
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,460
things that were kind of

247
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,500
um were potentially could happen when we

248
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,000
were writing our strategy back in 2019

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,099
are now realities and that's attacks

250
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,419
against critical infrastructure by

251
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,160
criminal actors we know all about the

252
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,860
healthcare incident here in in 2021 but

253
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,060
increasingly we're seeing attacks

254
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,759
against industrial manufacturing uh uh

255
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,900
people who provide those type of

256
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,240
services we tracked in July and August

257
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,520
of this year uh seven attacks against

258
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,759
energy sector uh providers by ransomware

259
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,259
groups in Europe and that's just

260
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,560
publicly disclosed uh attacks so so it's

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,539
it's becoming a really really or has

262
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,820
become a much more serious problem

263
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,419
something we're seeing with the

264
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,620
ransomware groups there's obviously a

265
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,000
lot of rebranding it's very very

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
difficult to track these groups because

267
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,679
they continuously Rebrand and that can

268
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,659
happen because of law enforcement

269
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,360
efforts it can happen because uh that

270
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
the heat becomes too much they live and

271
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,839
die by their brand their brand is what

272
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,820
makes them effective of but then it can

273
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,580
become a hindrance at some stage and as

274
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,380
well these groups they find it very very

275
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,459
difficult to get along with each other

276
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,140
so often they just have big fights and

277
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,640
then just ditch the group and start a

278
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,860
new one and but what is happening is

279
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,360
there's increased disruption efforts

280
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,339
happening all across the world and

281
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,300
there's a lot more coordination

282
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,519
happening I'm just back from Washington

283
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,440
DC last week where there was the

284
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,180
counter-ransomware initiative there was

285
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,100
36 countries we came together and and

286
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,540
there's a lot more coordinated action

287
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,339
and stuff happening behind the scenes

288
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:18,839
and while I don't think if I was here

289
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:19,980
next year I won't be talking about

290
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,279
ransomware I am more optimistic about a

291
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,260
global response to this issue because

292
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,940
it's become such a national security

293
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,380
threat

294
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,959
the next group I'd like to talk about is

295
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
nation state actors and the one thing to

296
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
note about it is uh geopolitics drives

297
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,100
the actions of nation-state actors we

298
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,899
can't look at these in in a vacuum just

299
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,700
look at the Cyber component you kind of

300
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,500
need to look at what's happening from a

301
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,959
geopolitical context and I think the

302
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,760
Russian invasion of Ukraine is a prime

303
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
example of that we've seen a massive

304
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,420
influx in activity as a result of that

305
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,100
and and that's why you need that

306
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
analysis as well you need the

307
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,980
geopolitical analysis to inform your

308
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,260
your your more detailed forensic and

309
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,140
malware analysis one of the trends we've

310
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,480
seen is the increase of destructive

311
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,220
attacks and attacks targeting OT

312
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,680
infrastructure in particular uh just

313
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,440
last year there was was two more OT

314
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,019
specific malware discovered uh so that

315
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,880
brings it to a total of seven very

316
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,519
incredibly rare but two alone last year

317
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,500
uh you know the the previous ones would

318
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,339
have been likes of stocksnet Triton Etc

319
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,779
um and we're also seeing disruptive

320
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:27,600
attacks so uh in Ukraine there's been at

321
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,339
least nine wiper malwares deployed

322
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,519
likely by nation-state actors uh they're

323
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,019
also focusing on information operations

324
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,540
they the nation states don't just view

325
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,300
cyber in the way criminals do it they

326
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,980
view it as a means to an end and often

327
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,839
that's to influence the public so often

328
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,220
they'll blended with information

329
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,660
operations whether that's website

330
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,240
defacements hack and leak operations uh

331
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,700
but the main activity of the Asian

332
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,220
States remains Espionage gathering

333
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,839
information to inform their decisions

334
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,720
and make geopolitical actions

335
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,279
and if you look at how that's played out

336
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,019
in Ukraine the Russian strategy there

337
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,940
they basically divided out their

338
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,680
operations in three main categories

339
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,779
they've been carrying out a number of

340
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,180
disruptive attacks within the territory

341
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,220
of Ukraine and that is normally in

342
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,959
conjunction with Connecticut effects on

343
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,279
the ground so they'll take out things

344
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,300
like Air Raids infrastructure sorry air

345
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,140
defensive structure they will carry out

346
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,180
information operations against the

347
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,040
general public population before an

348
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,360
instance so there was a lot of activity

349
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
a huge amount of activity before The

350
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,320
Invasion then it sort of Peters out as

351
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,579
The Invasion goes on because cyber

352
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,959
becomes a little bit less effective

353
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,959
outside of Ukraine Espionage is what has

354
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,700
been seen there's been a huge amount of

355
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,740
Espionage against uh bodies and ngos

356
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,140
across Europe as as uh as nation states

357
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,760
tried to gather that intelligence and

358
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,320
then influence operations trying to

359
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,779
drive the narrative particularly in the

360
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,880
global South using issues like hunger

361
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,660
and so on to to try and gain imp

362
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,940
influence and drive The Narrative of

363
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,519
what they believe uh uh it should be for

364
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,320
the war

365
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,300
finally the the last group I wanted to

366
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
look at was hacktivists uh hacktivists

367
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,980
uh are something that that saw their

368
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,860
kind of zenith around the late 2010s I

369
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,300
mean the likes of anonymous and then

370
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,920
really were at a low level of activity

371
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,200
up until the Russian invasion of Ukraine

372
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
and there's been a massive Resurgence of

373
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,000
hacktivist activity since then and

374
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,519
basically obviously falling into one of

375
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,760
two camps Pro Ukrainian or pro-russian

376
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,740
um and I think there's something like 60

377
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,540
groups operating very difficult to keep

378
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,700
track of of what they're doing and

379
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,440
mostly it's it's nuisance type

380
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,540
operations it's DDOS attacks it's

381
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,980
website defacements and what they're

382
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,920
looking for is media coverage uh because

383
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,380
if the media isn't literate about what

384
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,120
cyber attacks are everybody in this room

385
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,279
knows that Adidas attack is not as

386
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,459
serious as a destructive attack but all

387
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,959
the headline will say is Cyber attack

388
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
against the Irish government and and

389
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,800
then they've achieved their goal they're

390
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,779
doing local leak operations so this is

391
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,060
where it's a you know imitating

392
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,320
ransomware operators where they'll

393
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
encrypt data if they can get access to

394
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,800
systems but often they don't have

395
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,779
the capabilities to do so

396
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,700
and then one thing I wanted to talk

397
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,519
about before I moved on was I've kind of

398
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,079
gone through different groups here but

399
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,639
there's lots of activity happening that

400
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,860
doesn't fit into our need to the box and

401
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,300
and there's hybrid groups so for

402
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,040
instance the it Army of Ukraine it's a

403
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,779
hacktivist Collective but it's also

404
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,000
directed by the the the state of Ukraine

405
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,560
so it's sort of in that that gray space

406
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
something else you have is there's

407
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,339
hacker for hire groups so many nation

408
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,380
states want to conduct cyber operations

409
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,880
but they don't have the capabilities

410
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,339
themselves they'll go to a hacker for

411
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,899
hire type group and and it's difficult

412
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,420
to categorize them and and even private

413
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,279
firms are using them so there's a lot of

414
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,660
gray space here and not everything fits

415
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,220
into a neat box

416
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,680
and the last thing I will mention is the

417
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,300
increase in supply chain attacks we've

418
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,579
seen since the 2019 strategy it's been

419
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,260
absolutely remarkable

420
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,240
um obviously 2020 you had the solar

421
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,220
winds attack which sort of demonstrated

422
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,100
the power of of of supply chain attacks

423
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,320
uh and and because we've become

424
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,480
increasingly dependent on interdependent

425
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
systems on cloud software on

426
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,620
digitalization software supply chain

427
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,380
attacks become much more uh

428
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,660
um a much better Target for actors and

429
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,700
it also is a way of by attacking one you

430
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,100
get access to money and you know what's

431
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,139
been what's been stunning is the the

432
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,660
increase in scale in 2020 I think one

433
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,180
percent of attacks uh were classified as

434
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,579
a supply chain attack by 2021 that's 17

435
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,980
of attacks so you can see how people are

436
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,959
shifting and that's as a function of the

437
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,760
the level of security that their targets

438
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,980
are now uh putting in place that they

439
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,120
realize they're getting into the supply

440
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
chain is is often an easier Prospect so

441
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,639
what I want to end up with is I'm going

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,079
to give you an assessment of how we see

443
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,120
things in the ncsc

444
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,699
um this is the the Threat Level

445
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,500
descriptions that we would use ranging

446
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,839
from no threat all the way up to a very

447
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,500
high level uh and and there's a detailed

448
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,180
process gone through about how we arrive

449
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,639
to these conclusions but here here's how

450
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,160
we see things at the moment uh the

451
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,720
threat of cyber Espionage against both

452
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,760
public and private entities in Ireland

453
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,040
is access to the high uh the risk of

454
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,079
targeted destructive attacks is assessed

455
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,360
as low the risk of targeted information

456
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,779
operations is low to medium targeted

457
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,639
from cyber crime and ransomware groups

458
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
in particular remains high and it will

459
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,899
likely Remain the primary threat that's

460
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,220
right from hacktivis groups has

461
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,040
increased from low to medium with but

462
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
DDOS attacks have proved mostly

463
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,040
ineffective as I said they've been

464
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
mostly an annoyance rather than anything

465
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,639
else and then some other categories

466
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,199
there cyber terrorism is something that

467
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,519
we often look at but there's no threat

468
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,500
there at the moment individual hackers

469
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,079
we assess the threat at a national level

470
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,660
as low I would stressed that that's at a

471
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,040
national level obviously to individual

472
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,779
organizations an individual hacker can

473
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,459
do a lot of damage or even Loosely

474
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,440
organized groups of individual hackers

475
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,300
like lapsis we can see how effective

476
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
they can be with some pretty

477
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,959
unsophisticated tactics and finally

478
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,240
supply chain reassesses medium

479
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,760
so that's where we are as I said I

480
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,160
wanted to flag the point that this was

481
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,480
about how it's changed since the

482
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,060
strategy came into place in 2019 here's

483
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,740
a sort of graphic of where we are we've

484
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,600
done most of our strategy but we still

485
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,880
have two years left the ncsc we've built

486
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,279
up our capacity of the last file and I

487
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,600
feel like we can do a little bit more so

488
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,560
we're going to be going out to

489
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,600
consultation with some enhanced measures

490
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,740
of what we feel we should be doing

491
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,240
between now and the end of the strategy

492
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,220
and we'll also obviously be doing an

493
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,800
entirely new strategy from 2025 to 2020

494
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,459
30 2030. but in the meantime we want to

495
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,600
enhance some of our measure so it would

496
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,060
be great to get your responses to that

497
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,500
that's it for me and uh I'll be

498
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,519
available at the end if there's any

499
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,600
questions but I'll just hand over to

500
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,019
James now

501
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,120
thanks very much Joe

502
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,120
um as Joe said I'm basically responsible

503
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,519
now for the capacity building team in

504
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,440
the ncsc it's a new team that was set up

505
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,380
this summer uh just a quick overview of

506
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,959
what I hope to talk about basically the

507
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,000
role of Ireland as an EU member State

508
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
how is influencing what we're doing in

509
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,799
terms of cyber security and particularly

510
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,380
this new regulation around capacity

511
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,140
building in a new context I'll also talk

512
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,939
a little bit about the development

513
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,679
center that we're establishing within

514
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,040
the ncsc and of course the significant

515
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,959
funding that's becoming available now

516
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,359
through Europe in particular that's

517
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,359
available for business for research for

518
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,720
Innovation for resilience in terms of

519
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,480
ensuring that our systems are hardened

520
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,020
Etc in cyber so I suppose the first

521
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,299
Quest I suppose issue we have is that we

522
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,860
are in a member state of the European

523
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,720
Union and when it comes to cyber

524
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
security cyber has been on the on the

525
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
horizon in Brussels for the last maybe

526
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,980
15 years at least and this it was

527
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,340
established in 2005 for example so in

528
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,140
particularly the fourth strategy in in

529
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,080
2013 the next directive three years to

530
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,600
2016 and of course I suppose one of the

531
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,940
key wake-up calls was the you know Petra

532
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,120
and Wanna Cry attacks in 2017 and since

533
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,100
then we've been in overdrive in terms of

534
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,320
the amount of legislation that's coming

535
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
at us in cyber so we have the Cyber

536
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,440
Security Act in terms of certification

537
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,299
uh we kind of always alluded to earlier

538
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,299
today but in particular we and this is

539
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,600
now working on certification of 5G in

540
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,320
regard to EU common criteria and also in

541
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,120
regard to cloud services some of that

542
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,100
has been quite controversial it's been

543
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,220
driven by what the EU in particular

544
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,320
current commission I've been looking at

545
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,960
is strategic autonomy the idea that

546
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
Europe has been left behind we need to

547
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,700
build up our own indigenous capacity in

548
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,580
Europe and become less reliant on those

549
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,919
from outside Europe and in that context

550
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,500
unfortunately Russell has not been

551
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,880
making much of a distinction between

552
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,820
Washington and Beijing and that space so

553
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,760
in that context of course we have work

554
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,580
underway with nist too and of course as

555
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,460
as Joe mentioned uh we have a midterm

556
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,780
review of the current strategy that will

557
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,140
end in 2024 we expect this to be

558
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,120
published later this year in the

559
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,980
official Journal we then will have to

560
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,740
transpose international law here but

561
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,240
that will require much much more

562
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,340
granular National cyber security

563
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,000
strategy from 2024 2025 dealing in

564
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
particular with coordinate vulnerability

565
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,760
disclosure Act of cyber defense

566
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,700
procurement cyber hygiene secure threat

567
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,460
sharing groups Etc so very much that is

568
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,220
kind of direction of travel we also have

569
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,100
now this Autumn the kind of the Cyber

570
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,740
resilience act uh proposal on the table

571
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,039
so how do we secure our iot what the

572
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,840
concept of products with a digital

573
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
element is out there in essence so what

574
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,640
type of Baseline needs to be in place

575
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,340
and in that context Brussels has been

576
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
looking at okay we have all this

577
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,380
regulation what do we do in terms of

578
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,080
interest in incentives how are we

579
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,520
actually going to build critical mass

580
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,020
how are we going to pull resources

581
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,280
together

582
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,559
and I suppose in that context we have

583
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,720
the regulation here itself three key

584
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,940
elements to the regulation so you have

585
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,340
this new center in addition to an asset

586
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,160
this is a second EU public party on

587
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,559
cyber security has been established in

588
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
Romania ineffective it's still in a very

589
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
much a startup phase still looking for

590
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,539
an executive director to run it but it's

591
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,059
very much the pool resources there to

592
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,059
facilitate in effect an EU cyber

593
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,179
security competence community in effect

594
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,820
which again is to be supported by

595
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,039
national coordination centers and that's

596
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,039
where the Irish National cyber security

597
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,980
Development Center comes in in essence

598
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,200
and this is I suppose really much about

599
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,539
trying to get people to connect to

600
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,539
engage in an EU context

601
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,660
and I suppose that brings us on to you

602
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,960
know the Irish kind of uh NCC so

603
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,200
effectively this is now in development

604
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
stage so three key elements to it is

605
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
about strategy and policy influencing

606
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,460
the direction of EU funding whether it

607
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,100
becoming true Horizon Europe digital

608
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,720
Europe Etc

609
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,200
also in regards to the gatekeeper for

610
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,320
membership of of entities established in

611
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,059
the state here who want to become

612
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:29,280
members of this EU competence Community

613
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
who want to understand more about the

614
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,539
opportunities for funding who want to

615
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,820
network with peers who want to put

616
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,440
matchmaking together who want to be

617
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
involved in proposals for funding then

618
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,299
there is also the whole issue here of

619
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,580
Industry engagement and Outreach we're

620
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,280
very much working very closely and Joe

621
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
mentioned the national cyber security

622
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,059
strategy protect its core element of

623
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,039
what we do but develop is also very

624
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,140
important developing the capacity of the

625
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,880
state and in our context we're working

626
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,940
very closely with cyber Ireland in that

627
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,980
space with industry engagement and

628
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,840
Outreach and of course the third element

629
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
here as well is that there's money on

630
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,679
the table and we also got matching

631
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,500
National commitments in the budget as

632
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,320
well to run a support program for

633
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,419
industry and our thinking here is that

634
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,400
we will be running this in conjunction

635
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,380
with EU co-funding or over the next

636
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,200
couple of years so in that context of

637
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,419
course we want to understand better in

638
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,760
effect how effectively we're going to

639
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,500
run the center we're going to need

640
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,880
effectively a Advisory Group of cyber

641
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,100
student research a kind of Interest

642
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,720
particularly the public bodies in

643
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
Ireland that already involved in

644
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,659
National cyber security strategy but

645
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,580
also the researchers and Industry as

646
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,980
well to to more or less steer the

647
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,100
direction of the center within the ncsc

648
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,320
so this is the start of having an

649
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,400
industry advisory role to inform and and

650
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
assist the development of industrial

651
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,260
facing work that we're doing in this

652
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,780
space and of course we will have a de

653
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,659
facto National Community through this

654
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,360
formalized EU structure and I suppose

655
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,940
that brings us on I mentioned this is a

656
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,919
center there is dedicated money on the

657
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,559
table from Brussels here so 4 million

658
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,320
projects is in development we've gone

659
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
through the initial steps with the

660
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,280
commission we will be submitting a full

661
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,340
proposal in in February as part of

662
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,620
digital Europe program with this to

663
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,020
effectively run from Autumn next year

664
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,280
Autumn 2023 to Autumn 2025 and that will

665
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,039
involve running open call for proposals

666
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,159
to support uh in particular the SME

667
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,740
sector both from two perspectives from a

668
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,179
resilience perspective because that's

669
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,760
the core of what the NCSE does in

670
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,740
essence but also from the point of view

671
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,600
of innovative cyber Security Solutions

672
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
so for the smes who are actively working

673
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,460
in the industry what you know what kind

674
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,740
of what are the assistance what what do

675
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,240
you actually need to move to the next

676
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,140
step

677
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,080
and I suppose in that in that space I'm

678
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,020
moving on to digital Europe uh in effect

679
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,900
so there's almost 200 million on the

680
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,539
table uh we're discussing you know most

681
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,980
of that money is going to be going for

682
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,799
socks in effect and the concept of a

683
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,380
national stock in each member State and

684
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,600
network of cross-border socks is also

685
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
been talked of but beyond this so the

686
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,679
commission is talking about a public

687
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,900
procurement to run cross-border

688
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,360
platforms and they've also been recently

689
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,220
out to Tender I think it's closing

690
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,620
around today or tomorrow for a

691
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,480
situational awareness facility in

692
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,820
Brussels so this is very much the space

693
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,460
where the commission wants to go but

694
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,679
aside from that we also have funding

695
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,840
there for ranges we have funding to

696
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,480
support certification work and in that

697
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,720
context National sensitary of Ireland

698
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,400
are working with colleagues in Cyprus

699
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,940
going Beyond just looking at ISO 27 000

700
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,100
certification but looking to see what's

701
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,840
coming out from from Europe in

702
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,240
particular particular in terms of cloud

703
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
certification how do we ensure that we

704
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,159
have local capacity in place in terms of

705
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,559
Conformity assessment and also when it

706
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,440
comes to to to accreditation through

707
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,020
inab in an Irish context and of course

708
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,120
we're looking at 5G here we're looking

709
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,860
at innovative solutions and we're

710
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,900
looking at measures not just in the

711
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,200
context of the existingness directive

712
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,020
but also what's coming down the line in

713
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,260
terms of nist 2 where we're moving from

714
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,940
potentially uh

715
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,980
um no less than 100 kind of core

716
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,900
entities potentially well over a

717
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,659
thousand so in essence no matter who you

718
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,480
talk to you're talking about a tenfold

719
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,279
increase at least in the number of

720
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,840
organizations that are going to be

721
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,900
coming within scope so again we need to

722
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,580
be looking to see what type of

723
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,679
assistance and supports are needed there

724
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,320
and they themselves will be looking at

725
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,600
this and seeing okay to what extent do I

726
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,940
need to leverage off the experience of

727
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,799
others in this space

728
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,600
and of course that brings me to the

729
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,520
digital Euro program itself I mean the

730
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,080
commissioner running this at the moment

731
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,140
it's it's out there it's very very

732
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,900
it's it's up and running so you can look

733
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,120
at the call text you can read it you can

734
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,919
see what the proposals are you're

735
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
talking here about 176 million it's 50

736
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,279
co-founding but if you're an SME you're

737
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,000
talking about 75 EU co-funded so you

738
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,840
need to come up with the matching

739
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,580
yourselves and you're talking about

740
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
projects between two and three years

741
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,020
over perhaps running from late next year

742
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,700
to 2025 2026 so this is an opportunity

743
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,460
you know within uh digital Europe it's a

744
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,320
new program it's about research

745
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,179
Innovation and deployment and there's a

746
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,679
strong emphasis on deployment in the

747
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,200
space of course there are restrictions I

748
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,659
mentioned 3G autonomy at the start and

749
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:49,919
some of the restrictions in the current

750
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,080
program mean that it's not going to be

751
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,320
possible to use technology that comes

752
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
from outside the EU in essence and that

753
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,539
is a key restrictive Factor

754
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,039
unfortunately with this but we're gonna

755
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,360
have to figure out how we're going to

756
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,600
work around it and I suppose with with

757
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,960
that in my mind and we are organizing a

758
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,140
webinar next next week in essence the

759
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,940
details are available on the ncsc

760
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,700
website to more or less do a soft launch

761
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,240
of the center we will be having the

762
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,340
director of the ncsc we'll be having a

763
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,659
senior official from the European

764
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,179
commission talking about EU cyber

765
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,520
security policy talking about this

766
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,460
particular regulation will also be

767
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,460
highlighting in detail the actual the

768
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,919
the the the the opportunities arising

769
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,140
with this digital Europe program which

770
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,600
will which is opening next week on the

771
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
15th and closing in in mid in

772
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,580
mid-February so

773
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,020
um in terms of the development center

774
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,220
itself you're going to hear a lot more

775
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,100
about us we'll be doing webinars virtual

776
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,140
newsletters

777
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,179
um matchmaking events Etc will be

778
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,039
networking of the European level as well

779
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,860
in trying to ensure that that players

780
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,020
can connect and we're working closely

781
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,659
with Enterprise Ireland in that space in

782
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,419
terms of the the ncp's true Horizon

783
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,640
Europe will also be working with the

784
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
digital Innovation hubs that are also

785
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,539
been going to be funded through ET e in

786
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,900
that space and as well as with SFI and

787
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,880
others so I think there's there's an

788
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,919
opportunity here Brussels is putting a

789
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,440
lot of money into cyber and there's only

790
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,500
uh 1.65 billion into the core program

791
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,440
that excludes dealing with Europe you

792
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,260
know qci in terms of quantum it also

793
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,000
excludes the kind of work that's going

794
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,100
on you know in terms of digital skills

795
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,140
as well in terms of the Cyber component

796
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,840
so I think without any further Ado I'll

797
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,299
stop here and I think we can open it up

798
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,440
to questions

799
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,679
foreign

800
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,929
[Music]

801
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,520
thanks very much for the talk it was

802
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,020
really interesting appreciate the

803
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,020
service of the country as well uh quick

804
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,960
question for you so right now the

805
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,679
cesar.ie NCSE and the NCC will sit in

806
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,240
the department of climate action and

807
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,640
Communications long term do you think

808
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,620
that's sustainable or can you see

809
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,080
yourself going to maybe the defense or

810
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,960
Justice or a separate Ministry

811
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,960
uh

812
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,980
basically the way it works is we have

813
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,899
access to our Minister who's that

814
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,659
cabinet so we have a direct line in that

815
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,940
sense and our director often talks to

816
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,520
the teacher so it it really is kind of

817
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,260
just administrative which which

818
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,360
department we could we come under

819
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
um and cyber security the center we are

820
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
we're about National resilience uh or

821
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,020
departments development environment

822
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,940
climate Communications has a long

823
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,020
history of working with critical

824
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,279
infrastructure operators the energy

825
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,559
sector uh and so on so there's a good a

826
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,299
lot of synergies if you look across

827
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,279
Europe there's no standard model some

828
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,600
countries have it in their Department of

829
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,460
Defense generally Eastern black

830
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,679
countries many of the central European

831
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,120
countries alike ourselves they'll have

832
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,799
it in a department of communications

833
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,020
some people have it as part of their

834
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,880
interior Ministry or Department of

835
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,799
Justice and some have it in the prime

836
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,899
minister's office so there's no standard

837
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,159
model and I don't think there's any

838
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,740
plans for us to change at the moment

839
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,480
um is kind of short answer perfect

840
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,020
thanks thanks

841
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,140
[Music]

842
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,020
we're actually up for time now look

843
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,580
we'll be around anyway if anyone's

844
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,699
success
