1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,820
thanks

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,859
um I sometimes feel like that intro is

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,620
written by my mother it's like

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,880
long-winded and you know I'm not really

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,960
like that

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,460
um I'm going to speak to you about risk

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,839
and ransomware and I know you've heard

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,580
about ransomware all day so I'm going to

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,800
really do my best to stretch your brain

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,420
and show you a different way of looking

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,039
around somewhere and I'm also going to

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,420
leave you with some hope

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,859
um Brian likes to give me impossible

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,140
tasks like keeping Irish people from

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,699
their pints

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,260
um and and the other thing that you know

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,700
he wanted to do is was leave you with

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,860
hope so it's my job to make ransomware

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,960
look hopeful and also show you a lot of

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,760
maths economic statistics about

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,559
ransomware and still keep it fresh and

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,960
interesting after a full day of amazing

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,300
talks like I love this lineup I was

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,620
actually super intimidated to come here

25
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,660
and speak in front of all the people who

26
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,820
spoke before me but um I'm going to talk

27
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,440
to you about adversarial risk in the age

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,300
of ransomware right so

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,579
without further Ado

30
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,379
um people you know a lot of you think of

31
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,180
risk you think boring you think nerds

32
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,920
sitting down writing equations thinking

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
about maths sometimes I do that stuff I

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,180
also think it's really exciting

35
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,100
um I hated risk when I was younger which

36
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,320
is why I do it now that I'm older

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,700
um but the reason I hated it was

38
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,159
captured by compliance right and then I

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
discovered adversarial risk mathematics

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
and people say like oh you can't

41
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,500
calculate the risk of someone hacking

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
something because they'll change their

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,500
approach and they'll do this you can

44
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,479
counter factuals right there's this

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,340
beautiful set of techniques that you can

46
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,720
use for this stuff so what I want to do

47
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,799
is give you a bit of historical

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,380
perspective adversarial risk is not new

49
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,360
here's here's examples right so burglary

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,280
pickpockets fraud con artist kidnap

51
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,799
Ransom piracy livestock theft Cowboys

52
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,799
right vehicle theft duels I love this

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
paper in computer science right

54
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
statistics of deadly corals people have

55
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,880
done statistics on on duels people sword

56
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,259
fighting with pistols and so on so

57
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,820
adversarial risk mathematics has been

58
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,140
around for a long time and you can go

59
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,880
and study it a little bit more if you'd

60
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,020
like to

61
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,579
um so one of the things I needed to do

62
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,560
to keep ransomware interesting and fresh

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,659
is make it historical right capture all

64
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,280
the the history so I'm not going to talk

65
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
about ransomware in the small I'm not

66
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,219
going to talk about individual incidents

67
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,540
I'm going to talk to you about an entire

68
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,280
decade of ransomware and then the way I

69
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,300
want to stretch your brain is I want you

70
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,280
to think about risk from more than one

71
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,800
perspective at the same time okay

72
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,319
what I want to do is invoke Dan gear

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,840
who's wonderful genius and wants that or

74
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,260
many times said risk to whom risk is not

75
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,180
the same to all of us we experience

76
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,040
different risks it's subjective some of

77
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,000
the things that happen to you don't

78
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,280
happen to me and vice versa and one of

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,080
the things we always talk about is the

80
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,060
risks here on the on the I guess your

81
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,400
left left hand side risk of intrusion so

82
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,020
this is like the victim's point of view

83
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,879
right there's a risk that I've had an

84
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,200
intrusion there's risk of lateral

85
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,819
movement Etc I won't read this out

86
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,019
you're smart people you can read it

87
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,760
yourself what I want you to do is think

88
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
about the risks on the other side

89
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,739
the risk to the threat actor

90
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,080
their binaries don't work they're not

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,940
able to do the lateral movement they're

92
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,800
not able to get around some paid they're

93
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,420
not able to cash out the money they're

94
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,060
not able to launder the money right I

95
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,379
want you to think about that as we go

96
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,640
through the rest of this talk and I'm

97
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,900
going to show you a lot of data and

98
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,400
really push the limits of what I think

99
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
you can handle I like to speak to an

100
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,459
audience as if they are the smartest

101
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,140
people I've ever met and really push it

102
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,080
so get your thinking caps on okay so

103
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,000
risk to whom think about these two types

104
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
of risks and the main thing is become

105
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,220
adversaries to our adversaries

106
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,900
stop just waiting around for this

107
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,060
problem to get solved okay this is a

108
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,500
talk developed by a number of people I

109
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,599
can't do these talks myself I like to

110
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,220
think that I'm the second best hacker

111
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,340
that uh Brian invited to do this talk

112
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,080
um the first best is there on the bottom

113
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,800
right

114
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,300
um that's my friend Aaron Burns he did

115
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,700
actually invite her to do the talk

116
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,500
um but she had to stay in the UK for

117
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,299
various reasons and was not able to do

118
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,980
so so I hope she comes back again I mean

119
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,940
you might recognize some of the other

120
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,040
people their Trend Micro people so a lot

121
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
of this came from a paper that's going

122
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
to come out very shortly and a

123
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,819
collaboration that we did with Trend

124
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,799
Micro so I just I just want to thank

125
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,540
them because a lot of the the content

126
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,799
you're going to see was built as a team

127
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,599
and I think it's a team sport we got to

128
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,360
do that so ransomware over a decade so

129
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,099
this is a graph that I love to use this

130
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,620
is ransom's paid it's a decade of

131
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,120
ransom's page so I've been collecting

132
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,099
Bitcoin addresses Cambridge is a small

133
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,420
town I live there there's not much to do

134
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,640
in the evening so I collect Bitcoin

135
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,340
addresses right don't you Bitcoin cash

136
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,978
um so I've got something like

137
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,060
um I'm trying to remember now I can't

138
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,978
even remember 140 000 addresses or

139
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,720
something and it leads to this number of

140
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,880
incidents so of that we have all these

141
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,320
transactions each one of these is a

142
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,479
ransom paid it's a person it's a

143
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,800
business it's something that happened

144
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,500
and the amounts of money are so large I

145
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,240
have to use a log scale on the left hand

146
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,020
side

147
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,600
right I can't just scale it in a single

148
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,240
uh number so 10 to the seven that's uh

149
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
what tens of millions and then down

150
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,660
below you have some micro ransoms that's

151
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,220
actually probably us doing forensics

152
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,560
transactions but that's another story

153
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
um so this is what a decade of

154
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,220
ransomware looks like in terms of

155
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,259
payments alone the other thing that I

156
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,340
want to tell you is not everyone pays

157
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,020
the ransom you know that so the victim

158
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,180
pool is not just what you see here it's

159
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,940
maybe 10 times bigger than this and

160
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,500
those people have suffered some costs as

161
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,580
well and we're going to keep thinking

162
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,380
about it so this is a long game now we

163
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,639
need a better strategy it's not an

164
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,620
emergency it's not a newspaper article

165
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,699
we're not going to run around with our

166
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,620
hair on fire and feel like Heroes we're

167
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,240
going to work on this as a big problem

168
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,300
over over time many of you know this you

169
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,620
actually probably already seen the slide

170
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,940
today so I'll keep it really brief

171
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,860
ransomware has had these transitions

172
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,900
over time from small individual

173
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,340
ransomware incidents that targeted

174
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,259
individual people and elicited small

175
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,020
ransoms in the 10 or 100 kind of range

176
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,520
and then it kind of got a bit more

177
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,020
serious and things scaled and we had

178
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,340
cryptocurrencies and everything got

179
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,259
bigger and it scaled globally and and

180
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,520
now we've got these multi-million dollar

181
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,259
ransoms sometimes 100 million dollar

182
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,240
Ransom showing up in the news and in the

183
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,180
press okay so there's been an evolution

184
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,860
over that decade and we can pay

185
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,240
attention to that I'm going to show that

186
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,340
to you again in another slide but before

187
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,539
I get there I want you to think about

188
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,240
risk right it's frequency

189
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,580
and severity it's not just these big

190
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,740
ransoms there's a frequency of how often

191
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,419
the the problem occurs and there's a

192
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,039
severity of how bad it is to individual

193
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,000
people so I'm going to show you two

194
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
graphs I'm going to show you both at the

195
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
same time on the left hand side is the

196
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
frequency count of the ransoms I just

197
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
showed you in the previous thing so Peak

198
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
ransomware frequency was in 2014.

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,820
remember I told you I was going to tell

200
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
you hopeful things the most victims we

201
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,720
ever had in a single year from

202
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,639
ransomware from this data set as far as

203
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,680
I can tell was back in 2014. So

204
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,900
something good is already happening but

205
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,300
on the other graph that is the amount of

206
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,380
money

207
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,139
so they are hitting less people for more

208
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,720
money and they're making far far more

209
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,220
money these days than they were in the

210
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,840
old days so that's the graph on the

211
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,039
right and this is what happens when we

212
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
share data so again trying to work on

213
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
the Hope make sure you share this data

214
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,280
but we've already survived Peak

215
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
frequency of ransomware at least in the

216
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,780
historical view maybe maybe bad things

217
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,639
are coming but let's stay hopeful all

218
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,500
right ransomware severity varies by

219
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,780
family we talk about it as if it's a

220
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,000
uniform homogeneous risk this is the

221
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
amount of money in variance from each of

222
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,960
these different groups so the good news

223
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,180
is if you get hit by ransomware maybe

224
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,319
you won't get hit by one of the really

225
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,759
dangerous groups that charges you lots

226
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,539
of money

227
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,860
you might get hit by one of the little

228
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
ones deadbolt is one of my my favorites

229
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,039
at the moment they charge about three

230
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,680
grand a pop right and their tactic

231
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
techniques you know they're not that

232
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
hard you can really handle this stuff so

233
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,259
ransomware is painted as this big scary

234
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,660
threat that's always super bad but

235
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,280
actually most of the times it's really

236
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,979
not that bad so there's a very strong

237
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,280
correlation with who the family is that

238
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,020
you by and the size of the

239
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,759
ransom there's also a correlation with

240
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,259
the size of your business they you know

241
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,759
that they ask you for a ransom based on

242
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,620
the size of your company which one of

243
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,940
those two correlations is stronger I

244
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,800
haven't worked out yet but I am working

245
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,120
on it right

246
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,979
so this is ransomware detection

247
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,800
frequency which also varies by family so

248
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,060
what I want to get across to you is that

249
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,259
you can't just talk about ransomware

250
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,300
risk homogeneously you have to think

251
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,740
about each individual family because

252
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,319
it's different okay so I know a lot of

253
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,520
people who do mathematical modeling of

254
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,720
ransomware one of the things they do

255
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,340
wrong is they model it as one big

256
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,620
monolithic risk that's IID and it's not

257
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,620
okay this is distributions of individual

258
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,819
ransoms and this is where it's going to

259
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,259
get super interesting for anyone who

260
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,479
actually does incident response

261
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,199
um

262
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,699
different groups have different

263
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,340
distributions of severity right they

264
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,539
charge different amounts of money they

265
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:13,680
make different amounts of money there's

266
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
a whole willingness to pay equation

267
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,680
that's going on what can I do with this

268
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,660
data and in particular that deadbolt one

269
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,680
is really interesting you see how

270
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,139
there's like this straight line of uh

271
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,639
prices across the top and straight line

272
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,379
across the bottom that's really

273
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,720
fascinating that tells me they're making

274
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,220
the money on the top line that's what

275
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,539
they're actually charging and then

276
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,299
they're eliciting or sending out very

277
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,979
very small amount of money transactions

278
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,020
which is the bottom line and that is the

279
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,599
key to decrypt

280
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,539
in a blockchain transaction

281
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,279
right so they've solved the problem of

282
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,020
Distributing the keys for decryption

283
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,760
without ever having to negotiate with

284
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,560
you and they do that in that way and so

285
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,060
you can see that in the data so what

286
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,160
does this mean distributions have a

287
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
distance from each other some of you

288
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,240
will be familiar with tlsah or SSD you

289
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,800
know binary distance the distance from

290
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,779
this binary to this binary guess what

291
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,279
you can also do that with statistical

292
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,140
distribution so this is the waterstein

293
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
distance from this why am I talking

294
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,860
about this crazy you know economics

295
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,019
wasserstein distance stuff because you

296
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,000
can turn it into a probability that that

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,040
Gang has the same distribution as that

298
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,019
gang now that might be a victim effect

299
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,140
or that might be a prey or Predator

300
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,000
effect right and we have to think about

301
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,260
that is that because they're targeting

302
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,940
the same victims and the same victims

303
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,440
are paying the same amounts of money or

304
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,300
is it because they're using some sort of

305
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,860
tactic that allows them to negotiate a

306
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,380
better Ransom either way it gives me a

307
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,000
probability that these two gangs are the

308
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
same or similar at least in terms of

309
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,080
severity everybody with me now you're

310
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,640
ready to drink you're like too much

311
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,100
maths and there's a heat map and I want

312
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,660
to go home that's all right that's fine

313
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,180
never show them this graph again all

314
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,019
right

315
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,640
um You can also do this with frequency

316
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,140
you don't just do it with severity you

317
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,459
can do it with frequency so this is the

318
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,500
frequency of victim counts and you can

319
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
see this has different patterns right

320
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,560
you could literally see from the

321
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,300
mathematics whether this is an affiliate

322
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,860
program that's hitting individual people

323
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,779
or whether it's like a spray and pay and

324
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,580
then a decay in the amount of ransoms

325
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,800
like deadbolt on the right hand side so

326
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
just by looking at the ransoms I can get

327
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,680
a sense of what their tactics probably

328
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,680
are okay so again you can do this heat

329
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,899
map you can do this distance to say how

330
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,399
is their frequency of operation or

331
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,440
frequency of Ransom paid similar to the

332
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,120
frequency or operation of another group

333
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,459
which gives me a way of guessing that

334
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,600
this group might be the same group

335
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,940
rebranded statistically

336
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,740
and they don't have complete control

337
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,440
over it because the victims pay the

338
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,820
ransoms

339
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,519
so they can't change this until they

340
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,380
change the rest of the victim Behavior

341
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,760
so it's something that we can keep

342
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,920
statistically track of even when they

343
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,779
change tactics and Rebrand themselves

344
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,820
all right it's not geographically

345
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,680
homogeneous the risk is not the same to

346
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,959
you in the U.S as it is in Japan as it

347
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,640
is in you know any other country in the

348
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,300
world Ireland right so I hate this it's

349
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
difficult it makes pricing the insurance

350
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,140
products that I work on really hard but

351
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
it's interesting and it also means when

352
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,380
you go out as police officers or law

353
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,420
enforcement and work on your mlaps you

354
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,740
got to keep in mind that another country

355
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
might not be experiencing the risk at

356
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,220
the same level as you are so when you're

357
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,420
negotiating that and they don't

358
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,100
understand what you're on about maybe

359
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,839
this has something to do with it

360
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,660
this Regional variation in time you can

361
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,279
see this that's where actors are moving

362
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,079
East we like to say risk is moving East

363
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,700
more generally and you can see it here

364
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,440
they're starting to Target Japan they're

365
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
starting to Target Korea Singapore other

366
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,820
places it's not just the us anymore it

367
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,260
used to be

368
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,880
um but it's not

369
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
frequency is increasing but there are

370
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,899
also slow periods

371
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,399
turns out ransomware people go on

372
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
holiday too

373
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,220
and you can get a sense of when they go

374
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,300
on holiday and I'm going to show you

375
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,519
some of that it's going to be cool so

376
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,500
you can see here Peaks and troughs and

377
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,120
you can maybe even start to guess like

378
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,980
when's a good time to go on holiday as

379
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,920
an incident responder

380
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,720
um right after you've taken them down is

381
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,640
the answer so work on that

382
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,260
um but moving on

383
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,120
there's variation in the frequency as

384
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,640
well so you can see uh you can compare

385
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,800
this either in a country sense

386
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,980
or in the um ransomware gang sense so

387
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,720
the so the counts by individual gangs

388
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,680
and one of the things I want you to take

389
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,140
away is it's a heavily skewed uh kind of

390
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,200
set of numbers right it used to be Conte

391
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,880
lockbit is now uh risen above them but

392
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,260
this is kind of over a longer period of

393
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,279
time

394
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,660
um the point being that the two biggest

395
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,060
gangs take up most of the victims you

396
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,279
take down the big big gangs you make a

397
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,500
big impact right and then the victim

398
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,240
count by country unsurprisingly United

399
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,860
States the problem with a lot of these

400
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,720
statistics is that they don't normalize

401
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,360
by the population of those places and

402
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
that's dangerous you need to think about

403
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,300
that when you start to turn this into

404
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,339
risk

405
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,720
risk is not homogeneous by sector or

406
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,339
industry you know that you saw from

407
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,300
other people's graphs you've seen

408
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,920
similar graphs today my point is this is

409
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
always changing over time and it's

410
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,339
actually different by different gang as

411
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,139
well different gangs deliberately Target

412
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,700
different things so you've seen some

413
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,040
gangs say we don't Target Healthcare me

414
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,540
and my team sometimes sit down and think

415
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,459
did they actually live up to that

416
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,019
statement and that particular group did

417
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,180
so it's interesting to see when they say

418
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,800
we won't Target Russian infrastructure

419
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
we won't Target this particular country

420
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
do they live up to that

421
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,899
we can also guess how many people paid

422
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,399
we have two or three different methods

423
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,720
to do that this one was pioneered by

424
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Trend Micro so they have estimated how

425
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
many people paid Conti in that you know

426
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,180
two years of campaign time August 2020

427
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,820
to April 2022. so the green on the

428
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,800
bottom is the people who paid and the

429
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,320
blue is the people who did not pay I'm

430
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,579
going to hammer that point home remember

431
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,959
we're trying to get to hope we're trying

432
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
to go from ransomware to hope it's a

433
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,339
really tough job and I'm trying to do my

434
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,720
best for you but we're gonna get there

435
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,660
even the payment rate so how many people

436
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,300
pay or don't pay changes by geography

437
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,040
some countries are more willing to pay

438
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,200
than others maybe they're more capable

439
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,880
of paying for other paying because of

440
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,079
you know the amount of money they have

441
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,360
or whatever but the payment rate varies

442
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
by geography now that suggests to me

443
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,540
that you could go out to individual

444
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,060
sectors and individual countries and do

445
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
an intervention and say hey this country

446
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,300
is more likely to pay than this country

447
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,100
maybe we should have some regulator

448
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
chats in that country and work on

449
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,639
something or this sector is more likely

450
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,380
to pay than that sector guess which

451
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,820
sector is my most likely to pay this is

452
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,500
where it gets fun come on shout out

453
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,899
which industry is most likely to pay a

454
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,760
ransom

455
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,079
insurance

456
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,480
I knew somebody would say that

457
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
so it's a fair it's a fair criticism but

458
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,260
it's not the insurance sector

459
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,200
lawyers

460
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,300
just saying

461
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,560
um I'll show you proof of that in a

462
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,660
minute the risk even varies by time of

463
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,940
day so this is again Bitcoin payments

464
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,980
this is how much more you can squeeze

465
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,800
the data you've got this all the data in

466
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,260
the blockchain is UTC and so you can

467
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,199
take the payment time and skew it across

468
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,019
like a decade and then say what time of

469
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,420
day are most ransoms paid and you can

470
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,980
see that that graph is heavily shifted

471
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,019
to the right over the the past decade

472
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,959
because it was mostly the US and Europe

473
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,540
making those payments but it's more fun

474
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,980
to animate this over time which I

475
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,560
haven't done here but you can see how

476
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,899
that's changing over time so so risk is

477
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,120
not homogeneous by country by sector

478
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,279
it's not even homogenous by different

479
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,100
gangs or by size of business and it's

480
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,079
not even homogeneous in time it's

481
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,639
Dynamic so try and get your head around

482
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,540
that and I'll show you some more

483
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,880
examples so if you look at detections

484
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,220
this this table is kind of hard to read

485
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,199
but what I want you to see is you've got

486
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,660
Enterprise businesses small and medium

487
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,820
Enterprises and consumers down at the

488
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,459
bottom right and then you've got which

489
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:32,100
the you know top 10 uh gangs hitting

490
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,440
different countries but what you see is

491
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,760
that the number of times different

492
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,240
organizations are hit does get impacted

493
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,560
by the size of those organizations

494
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
larger organizations are getting hit

495
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,579
more often all right now if you're not

496
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,720
confused yet it's because you're not

497
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,680
paying attention ransomware is seasonal

498
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,360
this is the seasonality of ransomware so

499
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,220
this is the number of Ransom payments by

500
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,440
day of the year with 10 years of data

501
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,420
and 95 confidence intervals all right

502
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,519
ransomware hits you in the summer mostly

503
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,320
and there are particular days that are

504
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
worse than others so a lot of summertime

505
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,880
operations also some winter operations

506
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
right before Christmas they love to hit

507
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,740
e-payment sites shopping Black Friday

508
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,620
you get the idea but it is seasonal and

509
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,880
I don't think that most people expect

510
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,160
that so take your holidays soon next

511
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,339
year summer is going to be tough

512
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,320
um I told you I love deadbolt why do I

513
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,459
love deadbolt they did this awesome

514
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,959
thing where they put individual Bitcoin

515
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,180
addresses inside the ransom notes and

516
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,519
the ransom notes are on the front page

517
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,120
of these network storage devices and you

518
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
can scan those

519
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,000
and you can get all the Bitcoin

520
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,279
addresses of all the victims and see how

521
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,600
many of them paid

522
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,980
remember I promised you some good news

523
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,500
so I made a survival analysis graph here

524
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,300
that I think is really cool this is the

525
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,800
proportion of people who paid that

526
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,779
individual campaign so I think this was

527
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,820
8 000 victims

528
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,339
and eight percent of them paid

529
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,079
eight percent of them paid that's not

530
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,699
that many and it was three thousand

531
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,980
dollars for this particular campaign and

532
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,720
then the the curve there you see is how

533
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,280
long it took them to pay and a little

534
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,660
bit about variation of the number of

535
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,400
days but it's really tight so the main

536
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,780
point I want to make here is that most

537
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,119
people who pay pay really really quickly

538
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,160
and then people just stop paying they've

539
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,419
restored their devices they don't care

540
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,740
they've figured out a workaround or

541
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,179
they've given up on the data or whatever

542
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,640
so if you can delay people from paying

543
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,980
and get them thinking about it they're

544
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,020
less likely to pay but still more

545
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,640
importantly only eight percent of people

546
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,500
are paying do you see that in the news

547
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,299
no you don't you see the ransom was 40

548
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,640
million and super scary and it took down

549
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,020
critical infrastructure you don't see

550
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,700
that only eight percent of people are

551
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,780
paying

552
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,520
all right this is the financial

553
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,820
infrastructure graph so basically how

554
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,160
long do payments keep going to a

555
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,140
collection of bit Bitcoin or Bitcoin

556
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,840
cash addresses and you can see that this

557
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,179
curve like the Modern Trend is that they

558
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,820
only use a single address for a single

559
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,620
transaction and they don't survive very

560
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,360
long but the older gangs they kept their

561
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,460
Bitcoin addresses going for a little a

562
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,380
little longer actually a lot longer

563
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,700
right same way I want to make a guess

564
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,440
when the last wannacry payment was made

565
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,900
good guess not far off

566
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,480
um it was June yeah but they're still

567
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,160
getting paid the wallet addresses are

568
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
still receiving money

569
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,299
um and it's the right amount of money

570
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,520
you know in terms of what the ask was

571
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,740
all right we've heard about cost of

572
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,539
access we've talked about initial access

573
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,980
Brokers but we haven't really thought

574
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,419
about that from an economic perspective

575
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,120
if I buy access to your system for forty

576
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,220
thousand dollars I don't want to Ransom

577
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,200
you for less than that otherwise I've

578
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
lost money right they've got to make

579
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,220
money too it's an operation it's how it

580
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,679
works so the lower bound of the rasm if

581
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,600
they paid 40 000 in this particular case

582
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,760
is going to be forty thousand two weeks

583
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,740
later they're like oh yeah we're going

584
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,960
to charge you 500 000. that's the ransom

585
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,179
after they bought you for forty thousand

586
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,220
it's just economics but then that gets

587
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,539
negotiated down or maybe somebody

588
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,220
doesn't pay it so these guys have to

589
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,720
they have to speculate on whether or not

590
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,340
you're actually going to pay and that's

591
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,080
a weak point and I want us to mindfully

592
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,360
push on that weak point as a team as we

593
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,140
go forward so you can also see uh here

594
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,640
the proportion remember I said lawyers

595
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
remember that earlier anyone still awake

596
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,580
um here it is it's lawyers so the legal

597
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,919
profession on the top and the the

598
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,559
payment rate 20 of lawyers actually pay

599
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,700
out it's hard for me to read on this

600
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,720
lower screen so I'm going to sub over

601
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,299
here so 19 of media and the

602
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,179
entertainment organizations pay 18 of

603
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,440
hospitality 15 of financial uh 14 of it

604
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,200
you get the idea right

605
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
all right now I'm going to tell you some

606
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,400
some weird statistics mind-blowing I

607
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
think you'll probably go no way can't be

608
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,780
true all right

609
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,120
I'll start the story by saying I hate

610
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,600
that people use averages to talk about

611
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,960
Ransom payments I hate it so much I

612
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,260
wrote an entire academic paper about it

613
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,100
averages do not characterize ransoms

614
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,140
they are heavy-tailed

615
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,120
they are skewed they're very heavily

616
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,220
skewed so heavily skewed that the thing

617
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,020
I'm about to show you is actually true

618
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,419
it doesn't seem like it can be true

619
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,559
but it is true

620
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,720
it seems wrong right it seems like that

621
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,900
cannot be true but 92 percent of ransoms

622
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,940
in the data that I've been studying are

623
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,500
below the average

624
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,600
92 percent of them

625
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700
right and you know for those of you who

626
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,780
don't do this all the time and think

627
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,460
like that just doesn't sound right I'm

628
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,720
going to walk you through it this is how

629
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,220
this works right this is the the

630
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,440
simplistic example you've got a list on

631
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,480
the top you've got nine ones in the list

632
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,539
and one ten you add those up see I'm not

633
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,039
doing which I did I'm not making you do

634
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,020
this yourself I did it for you all right

635
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,299
because I know it's the end of the day I

636
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,740
always feel smarter every time I come

637
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,299
out of one of jaya's talks but she does

638
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,600
she just push it so 19 and then we

639
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,580
divide that by the 10 items in the list

640
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,919
and you get an average of 1.9 right but

641
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,140
nine items in this list are one and they

642
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,419
are less than 1.9 that's exactly what's

643
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,320
going on

644
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,200
back here when I say 92 percent of

645
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,760
ransoms are below average so keep that

646
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,580
in mind all right and then final

647
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,440
statistic in the work that I was doing

648
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,200
with Trend Micro fantastic team we were

649
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
looking at estimating for each

650
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,200
individual gang what the percentage of

651
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,880
payment was and then we're estimating

652
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,380
that all up together

653
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,660
it's not as high as you think

654
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,400
16 of people are paying ransoms only 16

655
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,480
percent

656
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,100
now there's some good news and some bad

657
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,299
news because the gangs are making more

658
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,740
money and that means that if you're

659
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,480
paying the ransom you know essentially

660
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,799
the rich one percent are paying the

661
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,780
ransoms and everybody else is suffering

662
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,659
they're subsidizing the victimization of

663
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,460
everybody else when they pay those

664
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,520
ransoms right we need a theory of change

665
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,600
that is Way Beyond make backups

666
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,179
I would like to see traceability of

667
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,520
transactions I'd like to talk about

668
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,919
infrastructure policing we don't like

669
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,620
using block lists but you know if you

670
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,179
can keep people from accessing payment

671
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,120
sites it has an impact there's some

672
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,860
danger there because it also means they

673
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,419
can't negotiate the ransom if it's a

674
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,880
hospital I don't do that stuff lightly

675
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,240
but it is important and it can be done

676
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,679
micro parameterization I think is

677
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,340
important business process policies

678
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,900
negotiation onion denial listing if you

679
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
can if you can figure that out when you

680
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,960
pay you're paying to victimize other

681
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,760
people the point here is that there's a

682
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,559
lot of things we can do to push on the

683
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,960
risk model of the attackers there's a

684
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
lot of things that can go wrong for them

685
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
they can get caught when they're

686
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,400
laundering the money their binaries

687
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,440
cannot work their tools can get detected

688
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,539
there's a lot going on that kill chain

689
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:37,799
we talk about the kill chain all the

690
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,419
time just make it probabilistic and

691
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,100
think about the entire world at the same

692
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,539
time don't think about just one

693
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,400
organization being awesome at defending

694
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,960
themselves and leave everyone else to

695
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,059
suffer for it right if any of this has

696
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,500
been interesting to you if you wake up

697
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,179
in the morning and think I really like

698
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,960
statistics and economics

699
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,980
I'm just kidding we don't do this all

700
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,720
the time I do this other people in the

701
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,460
group are law enforcement other people

702
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,960
in the group are instant responders

703
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
other people in the group are lawyers

704
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,260
one of the things we talk about is that

705
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,539
everyone has different reasons and ways

706
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,900
to fight ransomware so the police what's

707
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,080
their job is to catch the bad guy right

708
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,600
the insurance industry might sometimes

709
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,580
maybe help the victim a little bit

710
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,440
people complain that it never pays for

711
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
the whole incident I've got a clue for

712
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
you because I work in the insurance

713
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,700
industry now I don't know how I ended up

714
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,380
there I obviously did something wrong to

715
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,600
somebody in my past but the point is

716
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,100
insurance is never supposed to pay for

717
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,900
the entire incident it's always supposed

718
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,580
to pay for a small price if we paid for

719
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,960
everything you guys would just go out

720
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,460
and do bad stuff and we'd pay for it

721
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,620
it's it's a misaligned incentive as we

722
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,900
say so ransomware is only ever going to

723
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,840
get 10 of the the cost paid by the

724
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,520
insurance industry so don't use your

725
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,919
insurance policy as you read somewhere

726
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,020
response it's never going to be enough

727
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,360
money ever right and yes I'm still

728
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,559
pissed off at the insurance industry

729
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,559
that I work in from paying ransoms

730
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,539
so these are the other people who are

731
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,620
involved in this presentation I think

732
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,580
it's really important that you give them

733
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,679
a round of applause I'm a bit of a jerk

734
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,480
so don't Applause for me if you liked

735
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,799
this presentation it's because they were

736
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,360
great if you didn't like it it's my

737
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,640
fault do you have any questions are you

738
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,820
just done and ready to drink

739
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,960
looks like we have one question

740
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,520
I'll be super quick it's two questions

741
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
one how many lawyers are on the team

742
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,780
and

743
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,179
um of the lawyers you know 20 paying

744
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,880
around some Asos paying directly because

745
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,620
they were hit or paying because they're

746
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,880
they were the victim in that particular

747
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,620
case it's not like like of course

748
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,179
lawyers are involved in every ransomware

749
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,340
negotiation so it's a well-motivated

750
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,679
question like you're basically saying do

751
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,299
they are they just always involved in it

752
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,679
because their lawyers checking to see

753
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,179
that sanctions aren't being violated or

754
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,039
something no these were these were Legal

755
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,179
Services

756
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,340
um firms that were hit with ransomware

757
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,260
and chose to pick

758
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,840
and yet a second question

759
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,260
okay uh in the first Sig or

760
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,340
okay all right

761
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,840
I don't understand jokes I'm from

762
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,679
Cambridge

763
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,740
um

764
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,299
and just kind of like a two-parter with

765
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,480
two separate ones just on Monero have

766
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,520
you noticed loads of Trends with crime

767
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,500
and people using Monero as their Network

768
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,080
now as opposed to say Bitcoin or

769
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,520
ethereum or something under it because

770
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,179
you know chart tracing Bitcoin and

771
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,580
Monero still has been cracked yet yes

772
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,080
yeah it's a great and well-motivated

773
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
question there are threat actors trying

774
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,799
to get people to pay in Monero they'll

775
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,659
offer sometimes as much as a 20 discount

776
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,480
to pay in Monero instead of Bitcoin or

777
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
Bitcoin cash there are other actors that

778
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
use dash for example

779
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,260
so not everyone uses Bitcoin but the

780
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,320
thing that makes Bitcoin uh still very

781
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,779
important is the amount of liquidity you

782
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,340
know the problem with being like let's

783
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,779
say you're a huge company let's say

784
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,340
you're 100 million dollar company and

785
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,320
typically these groups will charge you

786
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,880
around something that's about five

787
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,679
percent of your annual returning revenue

788
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,080
and the cost of the incident to the best

789
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,640
of our current estimation is usually

790
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,980
forty to sixty percent of your annual

791
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,080
returning Revenue so easy business model

792
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,360
but um the point that I'm trying to make

793
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,679
is that

794
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,440
let's say your Ransom was five percent

795
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,919
ask at 100 million you need to find five

796
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,080
million really really quickly Monero

797
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,400
doesn't necessarily have that kind of

798
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,140
liquidity and it doesn't have the

799
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,760
adoption in the exchanges where you can

800
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
just go up and get the Bitcoin you have

801
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,120
to keep in mind a lot of these

802
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,440
organizations don't know how to buy

803
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,900
Bitcoin at all and so they have to go

804
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,159
and hire someone to do that which is why

805
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,559
there's negotiating firms end up making

806
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
a lot of money right well strictly

807
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,679
speaking they don't because only 16 of

808
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,539
people are paying so there's a huge

809
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,039
business model here for all the people

810
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,900
who are not paying and I encourage you

811
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,220
to go and work and help them

812
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
sorry I thought there was two there too

813
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,380
I'm really bad at math like what's going

814
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,559
on or math

815
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,960
no all right I'll let you go drink thank

816
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,490
you for listening

817
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,999
[Applause]
