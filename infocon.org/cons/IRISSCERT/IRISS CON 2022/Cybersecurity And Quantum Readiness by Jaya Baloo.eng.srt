1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:06,359
did everybody get their coffee

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,220
it's super important because we're going

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,440
to do some really heavy lifting in this

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,139
next presentation so brace yourselves

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,120
what we're going to talk about today is

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,880
the fact that cyber security usually

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,520
winds up sucking not because we're not

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,080
doing just the basics which we're not

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,539
doing but also because we're not capable

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,779
of meeting the pace of innovation

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,180
otherwise known as marketing

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,360
um we're just not able to build new

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,820
stuff without old vulnerabilities that

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,640
keep seeping through so we need to think

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
about this very specifically when we

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,420
want to think about embracing some of

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,340
the advantages that are going to be

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,739
there with Quantum Technologies and what

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,420
you might have heard about if you kind

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,399
of flip through some of the hypey stuff

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,140
that's out there are things around a

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,700
quantum computer have you guys already

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,980
heard or seen articles about you know

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,600
quantum computers being built and all

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,640
the cool things they can solve well you

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,500
might have heard like different stories

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,760
you might have heard things like you

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,379
know we need a quantum computer because

29
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,200
we're not actually evincing anymore

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,659
Moore's law but we're seeing the Advent

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,820
of something called amdahl's law and

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,400
amdos law says in opposition to Moore's

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,479
law that you're not going to

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,040
continuously get this exponential

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,439
computing power but that even though you

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,840
keep adding more Hardware your actual

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
total compute begins to decrease yeah so

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
it begins to ebb instead of continuously

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,920
increasing and you know the cool thing

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,680
about Moors was obviously not only do we

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,960
have like this exponential rise in

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,240
computing power but we had an asymmetric

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
effect of decreasing costs

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,500
so that was like super attractive but

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,200
that could be a very viable use of

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,759
quantum computers that you're using them

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,400
to solve very specific hard to solve

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,799
problems that need a lot of compute in

49
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,360
order to get their done

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,240
the other thing that quantum computers

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,560
are really good for are like really

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,119
difficult problems or needle in the

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,979
haystack problems but they've been

54
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,799
touted as doing much much more

55
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,720
they've been touted as being able to

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
have early detection of cancer of

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,280
solving climate issues of figuring out

58
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,099
how to do like Advanced personalized

59
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,260
medicines and protein folding better

60
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,480
than Alpha fold or meta-fold or whatever

61
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,700
folding thing you currently want to use

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
they're capable of doing all of this

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
other stuff at least that's the hype

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
that we're seeing so really cool again

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,319
these are not computers that we're going

66
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,120
to see at home underneath your basement

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,739
or that azizo is going to leave

68
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,440
unpatched underneath someone's desk and

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,060
these are really computers that are

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,400
being used for very specific scientific

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,319
challenges

72
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,120
um and when you take a look at the wider

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,220
realm of all things Quantum Technologies

74
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,500
it's not just quantum computers that we

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,239
need to think about it's also the fact

76
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,459
that when we have Quantum Technologies

77
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,500
as an underlying basis we also are

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,819
looking at things like Quantum

79
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,340
simulators which might get there in

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,019
terms of doing all this cool compute

81
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,660
even earlier than a computer actually

82
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,360
will and also things that we'll be using

83
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,280
are quantum sensors so if you are a

84
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,680
company like shell you can use quantum

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,300
sensors for example to look at the

86
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,819
specific gravity of different places on

87
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,379
Earth and then try to figure out where

88
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,379
to drill for oil more fossil fuels

89
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,420
um I'm just I'm really kidding about

90
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,040
that one by the way that was really a

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
joke so uh but the point is that that

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,879
that's what you can use one of the uses

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,260
of quantum sensors you can also use it

94
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,659
for more precise clocks Etc and then

95
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,120
furthermore this idea that when we

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,620
connect all of these Quantum elements

97
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,360
together we can actually provide

98
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,540
ourselves a much more foundationally

99
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,159
Transportation secure network that we

100
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,440
are calling the Quantum Internet and

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,540
that seems to be a development that's

102
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,980
genuinely progressing at least from the

103
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,019
perspective of Europe in order to get

104
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,720
there though we built this thing called

105
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,879
the quantum Technologies Flagship for

106
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,580
the EU there's only three flagships in

107
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,459
the EU each Flagship is roughly a

108
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,980
billion dollars or Euros rather billion

109
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,840
euros and the quantum Technologies

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Flagship is a little bit over a billion

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,879
euros 1.3 and I'm a vice chair of that

112
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,739
Flagship but I tell you that it's not an

113
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,120
easy thing to do because it's not just

114
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,340
that you want to have this end goal of

115
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,379
building all of these four areas you

116
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,019
also need a whole bunch of stuff that

117
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,700
hasn't been discovered yet

118
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,519
in terms of enabling science as well as

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,279
stuff to talk to the stuff that hasn't

120
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,260
been invented yet like the theory like

121
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,479
the algorithms like the actual protocols

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,040
that are going to be used when any of

123
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,479
these inventions actually will take

124
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,759
place so there's a lot of work still to

125
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
do in order to get where we want to go

126
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,960
and where we want to go is to be in a

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,180
position there's only three people or

128
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,979
three people three geographies that are

129
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,259
competing in this space yeah the first

130
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,180
geography is the United States second

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,820
geography is China third major geography

132
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,360
is the EU and the eu's ambition is to

133
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,479
knock out one of those other two to be

134
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,120
in the top two position for Quantum so

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
who are you going to beat in Europe is

136
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,940
it going to be China or is it going to

137
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,040
be the United States because the goal

138
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,740
for the EU is to make sure yeah you know

139
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,840
scientific leadership and also to make

140
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,100
sure we have a competitive climb

141
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,360
industry so that we don't build

142
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,460
companies that then later get bought by

143
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,160
Google and then taken over that IP goes

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,259
over to the United States and we also

145
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,000
though while we want to do not you you

146
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
know have that happen we still want to

147
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,780
make Europe an interesting for all kinds

148
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,040
of foreign capital and foreign

149
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,780
investments

150
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,060
a goal of the Quantum Internet is not a

151
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,199
small thing and it's and if it's

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
something that we don't have a plan for

153
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,039
this is actually something that is

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,080
happening right now in the background if

155
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,080
you are taking a look so this idea is to

156
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,699
connect all of those things that we just

157
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,680
talked about computer simulator sensors

158
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
to build this Quantum Internet across

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,940
all of Europe

160
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,919
and even here the question is who's

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,660
going to get there first so one of the

162
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
things that we know

163
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,120
is that quantum computers specifically

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,660
present a challenge to cyber security so

165
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,880
uh I'm in this group in the world

166
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,039
economic Forum where actually two groups

167
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,440
one group looks at how do we actually

168
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,780
look for these opportunities how do we

169
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,639
take advantage of all of this Quantum

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,860
technology to make sure we have this

171
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,259
like prosperous future and can use some

172
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,300
of this cool stuff to indeed cure cancer

173
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,759
or build a better drug the next pandemic

174
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,060
round and then also really figure out

175
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,340
okay well we also need to figure out how

176
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,840
to get the cyber security threats

177
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,880
mitigated so we actually can enjoy this

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,319
so again this time we are meeting the

179
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,840
pace of innovation this time it's not

180
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,740
being security bolted on but built in so

181
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,360
we can take advantage of whatever thing

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,699
we're building afterwards so I need to

183
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,500
tell you this and I apologize because

184
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,780
these are like really old slides but I

185
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,699
need to tell you this

186
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,979
everybody knows what a qubit is anybody

187
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,560
not know what a qubit is at this point

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,100
okay so I love you thank you for raising

189
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,280
your hand so in in computers we know

190
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,780
about this phenomenon of bits right

191
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,419
zeros and ones and the idea with a qubit

192
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,880
or a Quantum bit is this phenomenon that

193
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,520
you can have a superposition state of

194
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
the zero and one being there at the same

195
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,500
time you have to think of it which is

196
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,699
it's kind of crazy but you have to think

197
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,740
of it as a sort of opportunity space so

198
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,900
you can be a zero and a one at the same

199
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,000
time superpositioned until you're

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,280
actually measured in which case you are

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,020
deterministic you're a zero or a one

202
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,380
um and what's really cool about this

203
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,479
superpositioning is that with that

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,340
superpositioning you can take that zero

205
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,380
or one on one end and you can do this

206
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,940
really funky thing with quantum

207
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,500
mechanics which is called entanglement

208
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,319
you can take that zero one and entangle

209
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,599
it with another zero and a one so that

210
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,819
zero one is one qubit you entangle it

211
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,400
with a second qubit another zero one and

212
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,900
basically the way that you have to look

213
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,139
at the system is or any Computing system

214
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,020
is it's 2 to the N where two where the N

215
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,120
is the number of qubits you have so if I

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,880
have two to the qubits two to the N

217
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
where n is the number of two bits and I

218
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,000
have two what number is that

219
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,440
2 to the second is

220
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,020
more coffee more coffee

221
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,220
four good so how about if I add another

222
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,979
qubit all right so I have zero and one

223
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,500
zero and one and a zero and a one so I

224
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,479
have three qubits

225
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,479
so two to the third power is

226
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,680
yes

227
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,440
all right so guys

228
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,320
think about this all right if I have the

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,179
fastest supercomputer on Earth

230
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,279
fastest supercomputer on Earth with

231
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,120
whatever flops of processing power

232
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,839
what do I need to double that speed

233
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,600
or double the capacity of that coin of

234
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
the supercomputer

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,920
well thank you you're jumping three

236
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,300
steps ahead thank you very much it's

237
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,519
very kind of you but in order to double

238
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,200
the supercomputer that we would have had

239
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,540
in order to double that capacity we need

240
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,399
to build a second supercomputer next to

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,620
it right but if I want to double the

242
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,800
processing powder of a quantum computer

243
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,040
all I need to do is add one qubit

244
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,260
is this idea clear

245
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,420
is it anyone still confused about why

246
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,000
this is so cool

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
all right

248
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,540
good good there's some other principles

249
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,519
that make this awesome specifically for

250
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,860
computer science which is that there's a

251
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,300
fragility no cloning principle with

252
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300
quantum mechanics so all of these like

253
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,240
Quantum units they're pretty finicky

254
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,940
they don't like it when you try to keep

255
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,160
them stable and in their state they do

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,899
something called decoherence they fall

257
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,760
apart

258
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
um and if you try to observe them they

259
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,440
go they fall apart so that Quantum State

260
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,500
collapses and you can't copy them either

261
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
so like a replay attack with any of

262
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,600
these Quantum mechanic principles would

263
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,019
not work right so let's talk about why

264
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,180
that is relevant when we take a look at

265
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,760
it from a cryptographic principle so we

266
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,440
know all of our current cryptography

267
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
everything that we use right now right

268
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,060
all of it all of it pick up pick your

269
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,339
favorite algorithm all of it is using

270
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,880
some common difficult to solve problems

271
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,860
and they're something called one-way

272
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,220
functions which means it's hard to solve

273
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,080
uh in One Direction and it's opposite is

274
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,580
true like it's easy to solve in One

275
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,779
Direction hard to solve than the other

276
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,700
yeah so it's a difficulty of a one-way

277
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,260
function the only thing that actually

278
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,060
determines how hard it is to solve is

279
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,660
the time you have to solve it okay

280
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,160
so uh integer factorization

281
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,360
factorization is this idea that you can

282
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,060
take two numbers multiply them get a

283
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,160
product but if you now want to reverse

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,720
it and you only have the product you

285
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,339
want to figure out what got me there

286
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,620
it's difficult to do I'll give you an

287
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,140
example does anyone feel Brave and want

288
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,140
to volunteer for easy math

289
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,200
easy math come on easy math oh you're

290
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,420
brave wonderful all right nine times

291
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,160
eight is

292
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,800
72 thank you all of the products that

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,839
you could get to get to 72 all the

294
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,459
factors excuse me that you can get to 72

295
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,699
are

296
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,180
thank you

297
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,980
so here's my point no no it's okay

298
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,320
you've illustrated my point this is the

299
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,880
example of the one-way functions nine

300
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
times eight boom 72 give me now now you

301
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,560
have a product 72 not tell me all the

302
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,959
factors you could have used to get to 72

303
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,880
oh give me a minute

304
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,160
right and that's exactly how all of our

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,620
current Computing systems today work

306
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,560
with a quantum computer they don't work

307
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,480
that way anymore

308
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,279
and the reason they don't work that way

309
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,620
is because there's this dude

310
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,339
um

311
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,880
Peter Shore and love Grover and uh Peter

312
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,579
Shore basically figured out how to

313
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,120
reverse integer factorization yeah and

314
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,760
love Grover basically found a way to try

315
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,160
multiple permutations at the same time

316
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,500
reducing the total amount of time you

317
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,600
would need to find the right answer by

318
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,339
doing certain computations

319
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,140
simultaneously

320
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,620
okay so sure and Grover make it possible

321
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,180
for us to solve these two difficult math

322
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,760
problems discrete logs is basically the

323
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,680
example that I have here which is

324
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,959
otherwise known as clock arithmetic it's

325
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,720
the same principle if you have the

326
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,240
resulting answer it is difficult to

327
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,260
figure out the origin of the problem is

328
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,660
this notion clear to everyone

329
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,660
all right so what I'm telling you

330
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,339
in essence is our current cryptography

331
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,399
is weakened it is broken because we have

332
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,519
these algorithms that are waiting for a

333
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,740
quantum computer so that they can

334
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,560
actually execute on the promise of this

335
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,779
attack to our current crypto systems

336
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,899
is that clear okay so you know the

337
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,540
recipe is algorithms plus quantum

338
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,360
computer equals breaking our crypto

339
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,680
all right

340
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
but you've heard multiple speakers

341
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,120
before me tell you no one is gonna try

342
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,339
the hard route they're not gonna look

343
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,440
for some massively complex attack

344
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,279
they're not using AIML no they're taking

345
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,620
the easy routes they're like trying to

346
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,779
find what is the quickest way to get

347
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,079
there so more than likely people are not

348
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,639
going to go after the crypto systems

349
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,079
they're going to go after the fact that

350
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:26,820
we have insecure Hardware insecure

351
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,100
operating systems insecure protocols and

352
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,440
applications and usually in order to get

353
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,019
that you know idea and sense of strong

354
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,459
cryptography you still need to be able

355
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,260
to secure not only those preceding

356
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,300
layers but also have an understanding of

357
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,440
what it is you're trying to protect them

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,079
from home and most organizations don't

359
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,019
so assuming that we have a really solid

360
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,600
stack against a I'm going to use raja's

361
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,700
word of sophisticated hacker

362
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,740
um you still would need to get all of

363
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,000
that right and still need to understand

364
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,700
the level of you know sophistication

365
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,860
and we know that stuff goes wrong and it

366
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,600
does go wrong all the time really

367
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,180
because people still like to roll their

368
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,600
own crypto don't do it bad everyone can

369
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,639
build something that they themselves

370
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,380
can't break but someone else can so

371
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,899
please do not roll your own crypto we

372
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,700
also know that there's like concerted

373
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,440
efforts to do all different types of

374
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,120
Crypt analysis techniques including

375
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,399
traffic analysis also building side

376
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,100
Channel attacks and I love the idea of

377
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,639
the brick or in in the kxcd comic the

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,700
wrench that can be used so regardless of

379
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,839
someone not giving you their password

380
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,480
the brick or the wrench will always work

381
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,860
right

382
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,260
so I really think we need to have a

383
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,639
better understanding of what can go

384
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,320
wrong if we want to get better at

385
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,500
securing it the next time also these are

386
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,920
not you know once in a while efforts or

387
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,300
non-concerted efforts they are

388
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,360
structural and endemic in our current

389
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,820
and I don't want to say Democratic

390
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,860
institutions because everybody is doing

391
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,959
this they're looking for ways to do

392
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,399
expert restrictions when I started

393
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,560
working my first job was looking at

394
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,019
export restrictions on cryptography uh

395
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,120
we always have been looking at things

396
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,980
like hey all right you know if I can't

397
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,139
control which good crypto goes out then

398
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,880
somebody at least have that good crypto

399
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,100
for myself so key escrow golden key

400
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,660
stuff the same thing that we saw with

401
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,500
the iPhone FBI San Bernardino case uh

402
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,760
you know there's all kinds of different

403
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,560
considerations because there's really

404
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,220
shitty key management and we know like

405
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,260
from someone mentioned earlier the gsma

406
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,860
that's the mobile security for okay well

407
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,560
the gsma has gone on record and like

408
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
been very open actually I think about

409
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
the fact that earlier GSM algorithms

410
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,440
were asked to be weakened for law

411
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,139
enforcement so we do this stuff on

412
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,000
purpose structurally

413
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,040
and then when we say don't weaken our

414
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,839
crypto the Alternatives that we give to

415
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
law enforcement to get their stuff done

416
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
is look for vulnerabilities look for

417
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,880
zero days you know look for doing stuff

418
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,120
on client-side attacks and we don't ask

419
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,279
them to structurally weaken the crypto

420
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,959
for everyone and this is the kind of

421
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,459
balancing of equities which we're not

422
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,019
always great at but we still need to

423
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,480
find a better way to do this

424
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,339
and when you want to ask yourself how

425
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,199
secure are you or how much do you need

426
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,940
to worry in light of all of the other

427
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,860
challenges we have to have by the way I

428
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,240
want to say something to you and this is

429
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
really in light of some of the previous

430
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,720
speaker's comments as well the biggest

431
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
thing you have to remember if you really

432
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,480
want to get security right is that

433
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
there's no such thing as democracy

434
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,860
insecurity there's only friendly

435
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,139
dictatorship so if we want to get this

436
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,180
done right we've got to be the friendly

437
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,699
dictators and that means asking these

438
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,620
questions and then being able to be in a

439
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,899
position to effectively answer them how

440
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,000
long do we need to keep our secret

441
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,459
secret how long does anybody work in

442
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,839
healthcare

443
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,820
okay

444
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,139
um but if you think about Healthcare

445
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,639
specifically it's not just your

446
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,139
generation it's a generation of your

447
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,300
children as well we don't know how to do

448
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
that we don't know how to keep

449
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,040
cryptography secure for a generation it

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,139
is not there how long before there's a

451
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,699
viable quantum computer that breaks our

452
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,400
secrets within the group of scientists

453
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,799
that I talk to through the quantum

454
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,919
Flagship the worst case estimate the

455
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,160
worst case estimate is 40 years

456
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,179
obviously in that group of scientists

457
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,280
there are no Quantum Skeptics when you

458
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,079
speak to a Quantum skeptic they'll tell

459
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,819
you we'll have cold fusion before we

460
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,699
have a quantum computer however

461
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,579
when you talk to The Optimist it's more

462
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,760
terrifying because the idea the notion

463
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
that there already is a partially viable

464
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,679
quantum computer whether it's a computer

465
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,780
by the way or a simulator the bets are

466
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,179
still off but that is still being

467
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,820
developed in some bunker somewhere

468
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
that's the real worry and that that

469
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,780
timeline for it to be made public is

470
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,700
between five and ten years

471
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,679
that's the realest challenge we have and

472
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,900
then if that's the case how long before

473
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,360
we're ready and it's not just us right

474
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,059
it's every vendor we use on Earth so

475
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,100
it's the Microsoft it's forgive me the

476
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,140
Cisco's it's everyone else that needs to

477
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,580
get their stuff ready so that we can

478
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,500
call ourselves Quantum secure

479
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,200
so if we can answer all these questions

480
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,419
it doesn't matter how you spell it out

481
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,340
if you say you need to keep your stuff

482
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,140
secure for a generation if you say that

483
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,059
we have five to ten years worst case

484
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,740
estimate before there's a viable quantum

485
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,600
computer and then you need to transition

486
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
and that will take a decade at least

487
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,799
because someone else mentioned IPv6

488
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,980
before IPv6 is so old where are we with

489
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,419
that

490
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,580
you know so I don't think we're great at

491
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,679
change so we are already screwed we

492
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,760
already should have started this two

493
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,799
decades ago if we consider these answers

494
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
so if we take a look at when well it

495
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,660
really depends on how long it takes us

496
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,179
to actually do this factoring depending

497
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,100
on the size of the cryptographic key

498
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,200
length and the amount of qubits that we

499
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
have to our disposal no matter how you

500
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
slice it if you take the nist

501
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,400
recommendation for RSA it'll bring down

502
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,520
the average time to break that key from

503
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,020
you know whatever the lifetime of the

504
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,480
universe to a couple of seconds

505
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,000
with a quantum computer of size and

506
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,100
these are real concerns so what I would

507
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,559
like to ask you to do today is to think

508
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,840
about how do we prioritize things that

509
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,179
are important before they become urgent

510
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,640
because we all love a good firefight we

511
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,559
all do we're great at it in infosec

512
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,260
right get those things running we're all

513
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,660
like charging to the incident yay you

514
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,100
know we feel again like we're heroes

515
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,140
we're saving you right we tell everyone

516
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,640
when we shut down their stuff we're

517
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
saving you do you realize how stupid you

518
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,140
are but

519
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,200
you know I would like to ask us if we

520
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,120
are so much smarter

521
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,400
let's prioritize things that are

522
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,440
important let's keep up with the pace of

523
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,360
innovation let's build it in and not

524
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,500
bolt it on

525
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,440
and one of the phenomenon that we should

526
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,780
know about is this capture now decrypt

527
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,240
later phenomenon and the idea is and

528
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,400
this is a real photo and there's one of

529
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
several facilities of an NSA data center

530
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,039
this one is in the middle of Utah at

531
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,840
several football fields long

532
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,000
and what this data center does is it

533
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,360
captures copies of the internet and it

534
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,160
captures also the encrypted traffic with

535
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
the assumption that at one point in time

536
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,700
there will be a capability to decrypt

537
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,679
that traffic and old Secrets

538
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,200
subsequently are just as good as new

539
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
secrets

540
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,100
so this capture now decrypt later

541
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,539
problem means that everything that's

542
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,120
ever been transmitted is already at risk

543
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,880
so we need to have a plan all the old

544
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,640
stuff is already gone so that plan and I

545
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,100
I'd like to ask you to just think about

546
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,620
it an incredibly pragmatic way put your

547
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,600
religious convictions aside for a moment

548
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,460
and just think about being an

549
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,020
opportunist when it comes to security

550
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,240
and using whatever is available to you

551
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,220
to get it done so first and foremost

552
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,980
what can we already do we can increase

553
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,679
that key length to make it harder to

554
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,200
make the cost of the attack go up

555
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,360
because you need a more powerful quantum

556
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,720
computer to actually break the keys okay

557
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,820
so figure out what crypto you're using

558
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,220
and increase your current crypto links

559
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,160
if you're using AES you're going to use

560
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,840
256-bit Keys then we're going to

561
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,820
investigate options for a Quantum key

562
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,840
distribution I'm going to talk about

563
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,700
that in a second and we're going to look

564
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,679
at post Quantum algorithms which I

565
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
really believe is the most future-proof

566
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,400
solution in this whole thing

567
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,380
so let's take a look at the impact I

568
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,640
talked to you about increasing key

569
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,160
length well this was the advice this is

570
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,419
also the advice by the way of several

571
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,460
intelligence agencies of how you should

572
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,320
look at this problem which is that for

573
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,900
AES and for Shaw you will need larger

574
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,120
key sizes or larger output but really

575
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,340
because of the key exchange mechanism I

576
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,659
am still convinced that this is not

577
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,600
enough of a this is okay this is a tied

578
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,059
me over action but this is not enough of

579
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,220
a mitigation for it to be anything other

580
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,200
than a stop Gap measure are we all clear

581
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,280
on that

582
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,260
okay stop Gap measure but we're going to

583
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,940
do this right away

584
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,240
and for all of the other stuff RSA

585
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,860
elliptic curves you know finite Fields

586
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,799
gone broken smashed

587
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,179
when we want to look at Quantum key

588
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,679
distribution I want to introduce you to

589
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,940
this phenomenon of what the hell is

590
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,500
quantum key distribution it's really

591
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,140
simple Alice we know from our good old

592
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,880
crypto days Alice wants to talk to Bob

593
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,159
boyfriend and does not want to be

594
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,380
interrupted by Eve jealous ex-girlfriend

595
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,820
okay

596
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,580
so Eve wants to hang out listen to the

597
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,100
chats between Alice and Bob but Alice

598
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,960
and Bob were smart they put a Quantum

599
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,360
channel in between them and what that

600
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,640
Quantum Channel really looks like is

601
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,340
it's it looks like like light right so

602
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,159
uh what what it is is you have a single

603
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,860
Photon emitter on one side everybody has

604
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,419
polarized sunglasses or anyone has

605
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,220
polarized okay so what you know is it

606
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,140
lets light in one way you twist it 90

607
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,000
degrees it doesn't let light in the

608
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,679
other way right that's why it sucks

609
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,559
trying to read your dash cam or stuff

610
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,159
with your polarized sunglasses right so

611
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,679
basically Alice has a set of polarizers

612
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,200
Bob has a set of polarizers Alice needs

613
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
to configure her polarizers in a

614
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
particular way and then send that

615
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,740
information over to Bob when Bob has his

616
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,260
configured the right way he will get the

617
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,900
information from Alice if Eve is on the

618
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,980
line

619
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,220
trying to intercept this basically Alice

620
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,980
will know he was online because Bob will

621
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,659
get gibberish yeah if Eve is on the line

622
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,539
Alice and Bob both know that they cannot

623
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,240
communicate is this notion clear

624
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,840
questions

625
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,580
it could be a denial of service in fact

626
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,020
some of the most successful attacks

627
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,640
against these types of qkd crypto

628
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,799
systems are shining a bright light at

629
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,380
either side of the detectors because

630
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,419
it'll render them useless absolute

631
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,520
denial of service but then you also know

632
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,799
you can't communicate over that line

633
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,620
right and the the point is that what you

634
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,419
want to know about is if you have a

635
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,559
piece of dark fiber in the ground

636
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,620
connecting Alice and Bob was anyone ever

637
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,880
on that line

638
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,159
and the fact is once you set this up you

639
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,900
can verify almost the cleanliness of the

640
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,240
line this is just regular old-fashioned

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,340
qkd there's a ton of other flavors now

642
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,679
there's also entanglement based qkd

643
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,140
there's MDI qkd I don't have enough time

644
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,820
to go through all of it no no I totally

645
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,059
get it I'm totally over time so where so

646
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,380
I'm just going to tell you like it's not

647
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,240
that hard to do again opportunistically

648
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,039
there's stuff that's rack and stack you

649
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,900
can pop it in I did this when I was

650
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
still at kpn as their ceso I popped in a

651
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,940
qkd box I connected it between the Hague

652
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,740
and Rotterdam and we had a little

653
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,419
connection what we also tried to do is

654
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,740
together with the University of delft

655
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,780
built an entire little Quantum backbone

656
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,260
for the Netherlands and um again this is

657
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,299
rack and stack

658
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,580
this is a university

659
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,340
so it's slightly different

660
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,840
um and the clue is that it's a lot

661
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,600
harder excuse me

662
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,559
no it's not going

663
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,620
I'm dying

664
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,700
so

665
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,559
um it's it's not rack and stack but it

666
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,539
will work and it takes about a decade to

667
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,799
get another one of these tables up and

668
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,000
running

669
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
so the other thing you can do which is

670
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,179
also really cool with qkd is you can do

671
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,520
something called free space qkd which is

672
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,840
that you can actually do this without

673
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,400
having fiber because how many of you

674
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
have dedicated fiber between you and

675
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,140
everyone you want to communicate with so

676
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,299
you can do this over free space small

677
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,059
limitation is sunlight

678
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,980
for obvious reasons because you know

679
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,520
lasers Sun confusing

680
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,720
Iris like water vapor

681
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,740
the thing that I believe in the most is

682
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,240
post Quantum cryptography which is

683
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,640
reaching an inflection point

684
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,500
um and

685
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,140
where we are at that is we started

686
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,179
basically a sort of

687
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,700
a thing from nist to try to collect all

688
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,159
different possible new algorithms with

689
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,200
even a quantum computer could not be

690
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,539
broken the best shot at that is

691
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:52,740
something called lattice based

692
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,360
cryptography and I'm not going to

693
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,220
explain lattices right now but I'm happy

694
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,740
to explain it to you after in the Break

695
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,720
um so the clue with lattice base is that

696
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,880
like there are some really solid

697
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
problems that even with a quantum

698
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,900
computer cannot be broken we just need

699
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,880
to refine them so that they're still

700
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,520
usable with that incredibly large key

701
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,500
sizes so we came up with a bunch of

702
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,720
candidates with round four and what

703
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,279
you'll see is we had finalists we had

704
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,080
Alternatives and one of the Alternatives

705
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,440
was psych unfortunately uh psych was

706
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,120
actually broken and it wasn't broken

707
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,440
with a quantum computer it was broken

708
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,020
with a regular computer and this is

709
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,520
again another reason don't roll your own

710
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,260
crypto and it's really possible to break

711
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,419
this so that transition time that we

712
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,700
need to inventorize which crypto do we

713
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,320
need think it through for implementation

714
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,900
make sure we've got policy areas and

715
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,120
start failing early is super important

716
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,140
and

717
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,000
one thing you should know when we look

718
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,559
at the you know other side of the coin

719
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,080
is that China in ages ago already

720
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,880
launched their Quantum satellite they

721
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,100
have a 3000 long kilometer Network where

722
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,380
the EU spends one billion for a 10-year

723
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,260
program China spends 10 billion each

724
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,980
year

725
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,860
each year on Quantum so we're not going

726
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,240
to win this because we're spending the

727
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,100
most money okay we've got to think about

728
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,799
playing Security money ball here for

729
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,940
those of you that have seen the film

730
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,039
just watch it for Brad Pitt

731
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,480
um

732
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,340
so we've got to play Security money ball

733
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,559
and be smarter and not just win it

734
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,820
because we've got more money thrown to

735
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,679
it and you should know that that program

736
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,320
from the Chinese has spurred on a bunch

737
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,840
of other programs of space-based quantum

738
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,720
Q distribution that have real potential

739
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,760
for critical infrastructure and the

740
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
space-based qkd stuff can be used for

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,179
other things maybe it'll be used for as

742
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,279
a bridge between terrestrial repeaters

743
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,500
or have like additional gains for

744
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,720
confidentiality into you know the CIA

745
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,840
Triad or mitigating specific risks but

746
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,580
we need to find the right use cases one

747
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,320
of them could be for example if we want

748
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,880
to have the same type of growth in space

749
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,679
as we do on Earth despite having the

750
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,659
Kessler syndrome is we might want to

751
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:52,820
think about having different

752
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,559
constellations talk to each other do

753
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,539
reconciliation and billing and be able

754
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,299
to hand over data great example for qkd

755
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,820
in space one of the things that I also

756
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,740
did at kpn is we did a presentation it's

757
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,320
available online with the European Space

758
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,080
Agency to look specifically at which

759
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,360
critical infrastructure use cases can we

760
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,539
actually do to get this done again take

761
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,340
a look at the report one of the annoying

762
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,840
things is Vodafone already announced

763
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,820
that they're going to be the first 4G

764
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,000
network on the moon so those of you that

765
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,039
want to do stuff like that I do tell you

766
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,179
that there is going to be an entire

767
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,880
infrastructure that's coming up in space

768
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,440
um although there are a lot of moving

769
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,299
Parts when it comes to cyber security in

770
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,700
terms of resilience and we need to think

771
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,260
about how do we get better at building

772
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,299
stuff with crypto agility as well as

773
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:41,580
supply chain security especially when we

774
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,380
want to put stuff out there

775
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,940
an interesting thing that I hadn't

776
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,940
considered which I really got to mind

777
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,640
because of my current boss was the idea

778
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,100
of Amara's law that we tend just like

779
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,179
you know when we take a look at the

780
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,860
internet for example that we tend to

781
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,020
overestimate the effective technology in

782
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,640
the short run and then underestimate it

783
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,740
actually in the long run and it might be

784
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,900
the case that we're doing this again for

785
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,299
quantum that we're overestimating its

786
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,500
impact right now and then

787
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,059
underestimating actually the real things

788
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,039
that can bring us in the long run what I

789
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,559
would like to ask you to do one thing is

790
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,539
to make sure that this time we're doing

791
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,539
security at the pace of innovation thank

792
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,658
you

793
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,240
thank you

794
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
we've apparently got time for one

795
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,580
question yeah

796
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,039
hey how's it going so in regards to say

797
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
one of the big tree crack Quantum

798
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,360
Computing do you think we know or do you

799
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,559
think be more like the Enigma code

800
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,399
because I do think it'll be like the

801
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,440
does everybody know by the way what he's

802
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,580
referring to

803
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,340
right so the idea was that after uh

804
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,620
Enigma was discovered

805
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,340
the UK had subsequently given examples

806
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,520
of it to the allies and said we got this

807
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,080
stuff from the Germans it looks like

808
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,080
it's good crypto use it and actually I

809
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,260
was in the uh Dutch intelligence agency

810
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,779
well like you are

811
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,460
um so and they have this little Museum

812
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,320
in the in the lobby

813
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,940
and in the lobby they have this old

814
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,500
example of an Enigma machine and um what

815
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,539
was really cool was that they were using

816
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,659
it for quite some time after Turing had

817
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,399
already broken it so I mean like you

818
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,600
have to imagine the Allies were all

819
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,640
going ahead and using their shitty

820
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,500
crypto not knowing that one of their

821
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,020
besties could crack it so I do think

822
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,880
that this will absolutely be the case

823
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,640
when it comes to Quantum Whoever has the

824
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,799
Strategic Advantage is not going to

825
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,080
shout it from the rooftops because they

826
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
want you to use the shitty crypto so

827
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,559
they can listen to everything you're

828
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,960
saying duh and I suppose it's just to

829
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,220
follow up then so do you think it would

830
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,020
be a sequence of events that would prove

831
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,880
that Quantum has been cracked or do you

832
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,500
think it would all accumulate in a cyber

833
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,059
D-Day

834
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,720
cyber D-Day wow no I I don't know I

835
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,559
think it's really difficult to

836
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,179
prognosticate the future so I don't know

837
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,039
what I'm I'm just hoping is that we are

838
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,279
a bit smarter uh and Kinder because what

839
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
I do see happening are other things that

840
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,940
I don't think are so good for scientific

841
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,760
advancement look of course we're gonna

842
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,220
screen countries but we're now not

843
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,200
allowing students to cooperate on

844
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,480
research programs you know and it's a

845
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,039
consequence of our geopolitical

846
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,340
okay but it I find it really killing the

847
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,260
whole purpose of science is like

848
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,059
searching for honesty and truth and

849
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,799
we're it up with our political

850
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,080
nonsense and we're not letting students

851
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,279
work together we're not letting

852
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,799
companies work together we're like yeah

853
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,600
and maybe it's a bit naive to want to

854
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,340
have this better softer Kinder Planet

855
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,440
but um I'm hoping that we don't have a

856
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,880
cyber D-Day but I think that what

857
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,059
behooves US is let's get obviously the

858
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,799
basics right that we've talked about a

859
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,600
couple of times and let's also

860
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,120
anticipate some of the stuff that's

861
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,399
going to come down the funnel and just

862
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,260
kind of get prepared third look if we

863
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,899
are already having issues identifying

864
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,299
and knowing which systems we use and

865
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,760
which protocols we use on our Network we

866
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,559
really don't know which cryptography

867
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,820
we're using

868
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,620
and I find that really terrifying that

869
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,600
we have no way to inventorize that now

870
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,600
successfully across an Enterprise so if

871
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,299
it is weakened we are screwed and even

872
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,279
then even with nist

873
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,320
having a new set of algorithms we need

874
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,539
to be able to like plug it out and plug

875
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,760
in another one just to have this crypto

876
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,860
agility built in because that could also

877
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,960
fail us over time

878
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,310
perfect thank you thank you

879
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,520
[Music]

880
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,559
also on the point of the science

881
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,559
vertical versus political nonsense I'm

882
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,059
glad to see that even though you refer

883
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:57,120
to it as a EU Quantum Flagship the UK is

884
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,100
still a part of it yeah so

885
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,940
it's where he said at the eve of brexit

886
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,940
that in terms of science the UK instead

887
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,820
of tapping out wanted to lean in

888
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,799
and specifically around science and

889
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,200
Joint projects it is not easy I have to

890
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,059
tell you because funding is always going

891
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,200
to be a thing where it's like what are

892
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,179
you doing here you know and

893
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,279
uh but but it is something that is

894
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,500
clearly an ambition is to on those areas

895
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,019
try to find allies to cooperate with and

896
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,460
the corporation for example in the

897
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,580
Netherlands between the Dutch uh of

898
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,620
quantum program and like nist is

899
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,059
excellent

900
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,220
um Etsy works closely with nist in order

901
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,260
to come up with European standardization

902
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,140
so I really believe that Corporation is

903
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,120
our future only be careful who we

904
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,419
cooperate with app

905
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,279
well thank you so much for your

906
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,360
attention I appreciate this is a

907
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,760
difficult subject thank you

908
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,150
[Applause]
