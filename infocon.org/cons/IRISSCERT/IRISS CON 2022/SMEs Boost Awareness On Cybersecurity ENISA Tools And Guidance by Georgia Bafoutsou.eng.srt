6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,640
mean I have charismatic speakers I'm not

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
sure that I can live up to that

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,420
actually I'm sure that I cannot live up

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,779
to that anyway so

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,240
um so as you heard I'm working at

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,059
Tanisha the European Union Agency for

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,620
cyber security

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,660
I'm working

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,020
um I have two roles I'm a member of the

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,700
policy development and implementation

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
unit of Anissa and I'm also a member of

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
the horizontal team for awareness

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,899
raising and education

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,200
so I've come here more with my second

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,640
role for awareness raising and education

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,460
so uh first I don't know how much you

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,940
know about Denisa or if you know a few

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,378
things I can tell you some more

24
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,720
what is it's the European Union Agency

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,720
for cyber security so it's the Union's

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,140
agency dedicated to achieving a high

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,659
common level of cyber security across

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,040
Europe

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,159
so what we do we do several things

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,700
uh we do we help member states to

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,600
implement policy and I actually have a

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,200
common uh implementation of the Union

33
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,259
policies and laws

34
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:39,659
we we do capacity building we organize

35
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,740
exercises and like cyber Europe or

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,840
International cyber security exercises

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
we also work towards cyber security

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,159
certification

39
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,159
to enhance trustworthiness of ICT

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,979
products and services actually soon to

41
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,500
be launched is the 5G certification

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
scheme I'm sure most of you have heard

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,500
about it complex process

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,800
uh we are also working with operational

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,180
cooperation

46
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,300
operation cooperation mostly working

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,060
with research and

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,940
trying to bring

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,180
um the relevant organizations in the

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,160
member states together in case there is

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,620
a large cyber incident so that they can

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,860
work together and get through it

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,060
and Anisa was initially

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,640
um based in iraqion it was always in

55
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,400
Greece first it was in iraqion in Crete

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,980
and then it was strengthened by the

57
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,680
Cyber Security Act and it came in also

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,160
in Athens so now our main there is a

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,140
small office in iraqlion our main base

60
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,019
is in Athens in halandri we have a new

61
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,040
building

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,459
please come and visit us you're we are

63
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,560
we are trying to organize more and more

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,840
events there

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,000
and there's also a small office in

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,040
Brussels this office

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,200
deals mostly with the operational

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,359
cooperation part of our activities

69
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,840
so what we did about smes and how we

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,459
started

71
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,459
um it it isn't too long ago actually it

72
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,040
was in the middle of the pandemic like

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,980
in 2020 that we realized that small and

74
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,900
medium-sized Enterprises

75
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,260
had started are having more and more

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,239
online presence

77
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,580
so they were exposed and they were not

78
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,319
actually most of them they were not

79
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,019
ready to have that online presence so

80
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,120
they were exposed to to threats they

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,819
were exposed to attackers

82
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,140
so we decided at first we we wanted to

83
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
know what was the situation what

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,780
happened I mean what were the the

85
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,580
threats what were the risks that the

86
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,379
companies were facing so we launched

87
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,040
this survey uh to understand what was

88
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,940
exactly the situation at that moment

89
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,060
um so after that after we got the

90
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,400
results of the survey and evaluated them

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
we created

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,699
some guidance so we we create we wrote a

93
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,779
report

94
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,360
the report this cyber security for smes

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,660
report and we also have a small leaflet

96
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,960
that summarizes what is there what is in

97
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
that report so I have some of the

98
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
leaflets here with me and there are some

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,800
more upstairs in the National cyber

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,440
security

101
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,460
agency of Ireland so please have some of

102
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,699
them and try to disseminate them around

103
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,280
we need multipliers we need people that

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,199
can

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,360
can disseminate our work and talk about

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
that

107
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,060
so we also created a tool the secure SME

108
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,720
tool this tool gives advice and also has

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,900
gathered some advice from national uh

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,280
authorities

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,520
and you can check it out in our website

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,940
we try to participate in conferences and

113
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,560
in exhibitions I mean in conferences

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,800
like this one also we were

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,100
um some two weeks ago we were in Germany

116
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,000
in the it's a conference in Nuremberg

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,580
and we went to Greece to Thessaloniki

118
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
International Affair in Thessaloniki we

119
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,820
went to thick in France

120
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,880
uh we participate in online webinars we

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,160
are we are not a lot but we are trying

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,860
to disseminate the work and talk about

123
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
what we are doing

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,139
I yesterday I heard that we are not very

125
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,139
well known and I mean you're right that

126
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,340
you're saying that

127
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,820
we are doing our best to to help you

128
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,900
know us so help us with that

129
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,380
so um what we discovered through this

130
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,060
survey that I talked to you about before

131
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,620
we discovered that 99 of the companies

132
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,199
in Europe are small and medium-sized

133
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,900
companies smes and 93 of them are micro

134
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,580
smes and how we Define what is an SME

135
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,680
what is what is this micro semi micro

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,500
smes are companies that have less than

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,520
10 people

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,240
and and turnover of less than 2 million

139
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,440
as small SME has have uh has less than

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,319
50 people and an annual turnover of less

141
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,900
than 10 million and the medium-sized

142
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,240
smes have employees employ less than 250

143
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,180
people and have a turnover of less than

144
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,319
50 million

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,000
so in our study we had participants from

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,960
250 smes from all sectors ranging from

147
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,360
manufacturing to to even to Advanced I.T

148
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
companies

149
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,819
20 from 25 EU member states

150
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,539
and we had 16 medium sized 56 percent

151
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,819
micro simies and 28 percent small smes

152
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,639
uh these companies we realized that they

153
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,759
had increased dependence on Information

154
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,520
Services and communication services

155
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,500
they used

156
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,340
um the most used Services were of course

157
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,500
teleworking online

158
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,380
conferencing tools emails banking

159
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,479
transactions but some of them also use

160
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,280
the learning and e-commerce

161
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,419
and these companies faced a lot of

162
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,240
challenges they had a lot of problems

163
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,300
during mostly during the covet pandemic

164
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,740
so 85 percent of them were very much

165
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,699
concerned about cyber security

166
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,360
84 of the attacks were based on social

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,060
engineering I know that we are going to

168
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,520
hear more about social engineering from

169
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,580
Sharon following the following talk

170
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,240
and 41 percent of the attacks were

171
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,979
phishing attacks

172
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,160
people were tricked to clicking links to

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,919
going to fake banking sites

174
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,419
um so

175
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,080
our research showed that uh while a lot

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,459
of smes had to turn towards new

177
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,220
solutions to be able to survive to to

178
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,200
new

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,839
um solutions that could facilitate

180
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,899
teleworking they were not prepared so

181
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,560
they had some basic security

182
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,500
measures applied they had mostly they

183
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,680
had the antivirus and some backup and

184
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,740
firewall

185
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,080
uh but few of them had an incident

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,420
response plan or a business continuity

187
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,820
plan so they were not adequately

188
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
prepared

189
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,160
and of course there was these were there

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
are some of the challenges that they

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
faced

192
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,000
um low cyber security of the personnel

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,360
lack of budget of course and this goes

194
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,839
together with low management support

195
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,420
so if you do not

196
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,320
okay I'm hearing something you also

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,700
it's not coming for me okay so there is

198
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,519
law management support so that's why

199
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,860
there's not there was this lack of

200
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,440
budget management was not convinced that

201
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
they should invest

202
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,640
there is lack of cyber security

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,160
specialist and this is natural if these

204
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,560
are there are small companies

205
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
they they don't have dedicated Personnel

206
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,980
to to cyber security

207
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,240
and people are were trying to work from

208
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,580
everywhere they were going to work from

209
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,040
home so they took their personal laptops

210
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
with them and the the infrastructure

211
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,920
that the company provided was not

212
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,380
adequate to support them so they had to

213
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,480
use their own means they use their own

214
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,000
cloud services they own email accounts

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,240
that made them even more vulnerable

216
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,000
to the threat to threat to actors to

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,040
attackers

218
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,240
so we got some examples of smes that

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,940
were attacked and one of them was a

220
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,700
ransomware attack in 90 software service

221
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,339
provider with less than 50 employees

222
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:55,320
there was a not secure a remote desktop

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,180
connection so they were attacked by

224
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,380
ransomware 14 of out of the 15 servers

225
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,240
that they had

226
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,540
another one an email account of

227
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,820
marketing and branding company was

228
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,260
hijacked

229
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,860
and it was used to commit fraud

230
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,600
and there was a stolen laptop an

231
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,060
employee took their business

232
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,140
laptop at home and there there was a

233
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,560
personal data of customers uh stored so

234
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,040
the laptop was stolen personal data

235
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,300
was compromised and another one the CEO

236
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,480
fraud type of attack

237
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,079
um the financial people of the company

238
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,019
were tricked to paying money to

239
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,760
transferring money to a false account

240
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,860
because they thought that they got this

241
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,680
instruction from the CEO

242
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,399
foreign

243
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,260
and what are the lessons learned so from

244
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,279
these cases so we companies need to have

245
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,459
backups they are necessary to be able to

246
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,480
to recover from a ransomware attack

247
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,760
strong password policy employee

248
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,820
awareness are this is basic employee

249
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,920
awareness that's why we are trying to

250
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,220
promote very heavily in in my team

251
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,839
Indonesia

252
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,360
the

253
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,320
implementation of the need to know

254
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,339
principle for accessing sensible data

255
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,380
VPN for secure connections

256
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,959
some of the recommendations more are

257
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
listed in this leaflet that I talked to

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,120
you about and in our report

259
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,839
so we we tried to to split these

260
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,079
recommendations in three areas

261
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,860
um categories for people processes and

262
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,600
Technology

263
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,560
I don't have to go through all of them

264
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,940
I've already talked about some of them

265
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,959
um

266
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,519
so management buy-in I I stress once

267
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,620
again it is very important it is very

268
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,240
important to

269
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
to to present a good business case and

270
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,139
be able to persuade management that

271
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,200
actually investing in cyber security is

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,540
value for money it's worth the

273
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,839
investment because it is possible that

274
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,720
the money you're going to lose in case

275
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,440
there is a Cyber attack are less than

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,260
the ones that you would have spent

277
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,500
investing in measures and in cyber

278
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,519
security

279
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,680
proper measures and policies

280
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,079
again our actions so

281
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,139
um we have the security the dedicated

282
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,519
leaflet

283
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,459
and we run actually this year a campaign

284
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,000
about smes with some videos and a nice

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,899
Pac-Man game

286
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,060
um this you can be fined you can find

287
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,979
all of them in our website

288
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,120
and our next steps we are now finalizing

289
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,399
a work on

290
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,519
cyber security maturity assessment for

291
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,920
small and medium-sized Enterprises so it

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,260
will be an online tool that you will be

293
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,880
able to use

294
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,260
and assess

295
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,360
the maturity as far as cyber security is

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,200
concerned of your company

297
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,600
answering some simple questions and

298
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,940
getting them some graphs so that you

299
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,339
know are you the companies can know if

300
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,139
they are mature enough or they they have

301
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:49,040
to invest more

302
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,720
so this leaflet that I talked to you

303
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,060
about more than once is also translated

304
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,019
in Irish I cannot of course read it and

305
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:02,040
we don't have it printed but we have it

306
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,519
online please download it

307
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,240
um

308
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,540
and this is like a small video

309
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,279
foreign

310
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,660
foreign

311
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,639
thank you

312
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,899
so um about cyber security awareness we

313
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,959
are doing some more about it

314
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,220
uh we are having soon to be

315
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,640
launched in our website uh what we call

316
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,880
a awareness AR in a box awareness

317
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,660
raising in a box so this will be a tool

318
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,919
a framework

319
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,619
that will have information and

320
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,679
guidelines and templates and videos

321
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,500
and checklists for the companies to be

322
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,359
able to build their own cyber security

323
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,119
awareness programs and what is the cyber

324
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,460
security awareness program it is a plan

325
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,220
that encompasses multiple awareness

326
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,380
raising activities over a long period of

327
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,299
time following the organizational

328
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,780
strategy for cyber security so employees

329
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,059
will be teached how to mitigate the

330
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,039
impact of cyber threats

331
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,760
and this program will it is recommended

332
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,220
to have activities materials training

333
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,280
also games to be able to promote a

334
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
culture of cyber security

335
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,780
these things will be included in this

336
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,280
box of ours

337
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,500
that will be downloadable from our

338
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,660
website

339
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,400
some of these documents that we will

340
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,720
have here

341
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,299
a guide for a cyber awareness program a

342
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,780
guide for cyber awareness campaign what

343
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,480
are the tools and from channels that you

344
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,039
should use depending on your target

345
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,179
audience

346
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,260
what are the metrics that you can use to

347
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,260
be able to to evaluate the the success

348
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,179
of your program

349
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,059
and of course as I told you games are

350
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,059
very important we have a game actually

351
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,240
there and a guide on how to run this

352
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
game

353
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,280
and a communication strategy what is the

354
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
what is the communication strategy is

355
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
that you should follow for your program

356
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,120
to be successful

357
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,640
this is part of our game some quizzes

358
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,340
that we have prepared some cards like

359
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,679
gaming cards that kids used to play with

360
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,520
with

361
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,480
having some easy multiple choice

362
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,140
questions that have a simple answer

363
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,940
we've tried to play them in the

364
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,460
conferences that we were attending in

365
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,620
the exhibitions they were actually very

366
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,860
very successful people like them and I

367
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,440
think that they will be enhanced up to

368
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,440
now we have a few of them on the site on

369
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,580
our website

370
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,380
but they will be enhanced to include

371
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,440
more it is an easy way to to teach

372
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,500
employees and they are not bored if you

373
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
use it

374
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,059
they can be used in in team building

375
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,580
events and combined with team building

376
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,679
events in the companies

377
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,620
this is a screenshot of this tabletop

378
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,080
game that we are having there is a

379
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,900
scenario of a company being hacked and

380
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,299
the employees of the com of the are

381
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,760
splitting groups and they are trying to

382
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,299
find out who actually did the hack who

383
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,460
was affected who was the victim who was

384
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,440
the first victim of the hack

385
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,400
and then there is this algorithm a

386
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,340
decrypting algorithm and using some the

387
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,100
hints that they have already found they

388
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,360
should

389
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,280
try and find out and decrypt the the

390
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,679
file name of the of the encrypted file

391
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,320
so several versions of this game

392
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,380
tabletop one using a presentation and

393
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,799
Mini game this is the mini game

394
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,520
and finally these are some screenshots

395
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,539
of Health Care sector campaign that we

396
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,200
run this year in June

397
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,860
to coincide with the Cyber Europe 2022

398
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,400
December Europe exercises was focused on

399
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,960
health care so we ran our campaign

400
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,820
during that period we had the mascot Dr

401
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,039
Schreiber

402
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,020
who delivered a very useful advice

403
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,260
having to do with fishing with cyber

404
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,160
hygiene and with ransomware

405
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,260
um and and other campaigns that we did

406
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,799
this year was about the energy sector

407
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,640
here we didn't have Dr cyber but we had

408
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,700
the Cyber Sparkle our little Sparkle

409
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,520
yellow one and it became green and red

410
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,620
depending on the situation

411
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,960
uh so electricity this was targeted to

412
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,539
a transmission system operators next

413
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,340
year we'll have another one for

414
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,900
distribution system operators so

415
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,840
this thing or this campaign material

416
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,620
that is I know it's sector specific

417
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,460
because I've talked to you about

418
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,120
Healthcare and energy we plan to have it

419
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,440
sector agnostic and to include it in our

420
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,380
box you know in our awareness raising

421
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,780
box so that I know that all the

422
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,080
guidelines may be useful but more useful

423
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,140
for the companies could be ready-made

424
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,380
material that they could just download

425
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,620
and use the language barrier

426
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,000
is a problem

427
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,179
so I we know that we need to translate

428
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,960
our material in as much more languages

429
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,720
as we can as many languages as we can

430
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,600
the actually the SME leaflet is

431
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,179
translated to almost all European

432
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,240
languages you can find it online

433
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,620
we are trying to use our ad hoc groups

434
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,380
and our stakeholders to help us with

435
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,720
translation of the material

436
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,740
and we want also multipliers we want

437
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,919
ambassadors for our work so please join

438
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,919
us and help us disseminate our messages

439
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,260
and thank you for your attention

440
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,520
any questions I think okay

441
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,020
and look

442
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,960
just okay uh thank you for the talk it

443
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,240
was very interesting I'm I applaud the

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,100
12 Steps it's really good because I know

445
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,679
a lot of small companies just haven't

446
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,320
even thought about this but on the other

447
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,500
hand isn't it a bit expensive not in

448
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,080
terms of cost of like money but in terms

449
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,240
of overall cost of having to invest in

450
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,460
such such things because you know we're

451
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,140
talking micro smes less than five people

452
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,960
potentially how do they actually balance

453
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,520
that with the work that they have to do

454
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,320
in keeping their business open have you

455
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,419
thought about that

456
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,960
foreign

457
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,179
I mean I I guess you mean in general

458
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,299
cyber security not awareness about cyber

459
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,539
security in general of course I mean we

460
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,140
know that it is expensive

461
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,140
I mean we we realize that this is an

462
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,179
investment a serious investment on

463
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,460
behalf of the companies

464
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,520
but I I think that there are ways to be

465
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,740
able to do it with less cost

466
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,740
we are I mean cyber security awareness

467
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,620
is one of these methods

468
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,120
uh I mean we cannot just base on

469
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,320
technology

470
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,799
so we have to to base

471
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,020
especially small companies have to base

472
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,419
their defenses on their people

473
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,860
so

474
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,880
it is not expensive

475
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,740
to enhance the cyber security awareness

476
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,000
there are open tools there are

477
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,460
that's why we are doing these activities

478
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,400
we are offering

479
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,100
opportunities for companies to be able

480
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,780
to use

481
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,780
our material to train their personnel

482
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,120
and to enhance awareness

483
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,159
and I in in general I believe that that

484
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,100
of course there is some investment that

485
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,440
should be made in cyber security and

486
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,860
there is

487
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,460
with a minimum cost it should be done

488
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,159
because as I said before

489
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,940
it is it should be it would be more

490
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,440
expensive to

491
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,740
to face the impact of an attack

492
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,039
than the the cost that you would have

493
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,299
done in order to prevent prevention

494
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,720
is surely better than cure yeah

495
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,419
I know it's not easy I mean we are

496
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,340
trying to find ways in Indonesia that's

497
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,740
what we are trying to do

498
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,620
to be able to to help small Enterprises

499
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,840
especially with micro smes

500
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,640
to do it as a

501
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,100
as more as less

502
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,959
expensive as possible

503
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,419
thank you so much for a wonderful

504
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,000
session that was fascinating I think the

505
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,919
the actual answer that question is can

506
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,799
companies not afford to do it as it were

507
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,720
um not can they afford to do it looking

508
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,000
at the amount of threat actors that

509
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,799
we've seen that are out there operating

510
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,419
um my question would be um on your

511
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,940
slides you look at um cyber security as

512
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,559
a team sport

513
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,900
um what sort of work if any areanese are

514
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,640
doing with other organizations across

515
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,200
the globe like Caesar or the national

516
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,059
cyber security Center in the UK because

517
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,559
they seem to be very strong parallels

518
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,779
with some of that work

519
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,960
foreign

520
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,640
actually with Caesar if I'm not mistaken

521
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,760
uh last year we had a common uh campaign

522
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,740
about uh smaller medium-sized

523
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,600
Enterprises not last year or the year

524
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,740
before

525
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,960
so we did

526
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,120
um

527
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,740
do some common

528
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,440
events a common campaign we launched a

529
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,559
common campaign with Caesar and

530
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,720
um this um framework has been based in a

531
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,179
lot of UK initiatives for maturity

532
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,159
assessment Frameworks

533
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:26,460
uh we have a

534
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,480
um we are running uh groups that are

535
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,020
comprised of people that are also in in

536
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,600
the private sector and are also in of

537
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,320
the public sector so we have a group a

538
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,179
working group for small and medium-sized

539
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,000
Enterprises there are people there

540
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,279
from the private sector and from the

541
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,260
public sector from various European

542
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,799
countries we also have another group for

543
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,740
awareness raising and education

544
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,200
that is members of this group are people

545
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,020
from both public and private sectors so

546
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,000
that we are able to work with all

547
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
organizations that do relevant to work

548
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,620
for us and this work

549
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,400
is referenced in this security we have a

550
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,679
referencing we have been referencing

551
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,100
work of um other authorities in other

552
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,919
European member states of course our

553
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,900
work is mostly in Europe less with us

554
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,539
we know that they're very Advanced out

555
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,380
there

556
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,900
we have some limitations but we are

557
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,000
trying we have even an international

558
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,980
strategy

559
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,260
that we are trying to cooperate with

560
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,140
authorities and organizations in Europe

561
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,980
outside of course outside of Europe

562
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,120
uh one last question

563
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,559
thanks for the presentation I just want

564
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,840
to go on a point of the gamification

565
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,179
piece because I think it's excellent

566
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,159
to engage people through the

567
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,900
gamification piece because people will

568
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
find topics or documentation slide decks

569
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,779
whatever very boring and you would get

570
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,000
disconnect from zacies or hire with

571
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,179
people there'd be less technical so if

572
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,220
you guys are continuing to drive the

573
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,159
gamification piece that'd be great to

574
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,480
engage with people in the cyber security

575
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,059
awareness piece you know because that's

576
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,760
how you and get a good engagement it's

577
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
all about getting engaging because

578
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,320
people see cyber or or trainings or

579
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,820
something they go at you I'm not doing

580
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,440
that I have something important notes to

581
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,020
do so if you gamify it it's more

582
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,640
engaging I think

583
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,399
yet we realize that so that's why we are

584
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,340
trying to build this um these games I

585
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,200
mean this is a simple game just a simple

586
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,940
scenario for a company that has been

587
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,520
hacked and you have to to resolve the

588
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,940
the myth to resolve the game and find

589
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,299
out who did it we played it on ourselves

590
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,960
between ourselves and it was exciting uh

591
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,940
it doesn't take a lot of time just an

592
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,020
hour

593
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,320
so and we have the mini game that's even

594
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,279
less and we we are also planning and we

595
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,659
hope that we are going to do it next

596
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:12,600
year to have it online I mean have a

597
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,260
game online using a probably a platform

598
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,020
we haven't figured out yet how to do it

599
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,980
but yes we are we are trying to do we

600
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,000
acknowledge the the value of the games

601
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,840
in uh in enhancing and awareness raising

602
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,418
okay so thank you
