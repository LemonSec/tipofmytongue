1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,460
good morning everybody and you're all

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,820
very welcome to Iris Khan 2022 the Irish

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,800
conference on cybercrime

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,780
thank you all so much for coming I can

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,980
see just even by the the seating

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,599
arrangements we're expecting the biggest

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,980
numbers we've ever had of the conference

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,480
that's fantastic great to see such

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,500
support

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,119
I'm your host for today my name is

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,100
Gordon Smith I've been covering cyber

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,859
security as a journalist and on podcasts

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,180
and blogs for the better part of 20

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,180
years I get the honor of introducing our

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,399
absolutely amazing lineup of speakers to

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,719
you today

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,460
it's entirely appropriate I think that

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,680
we're here in the Aviva Stadium a venue

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
that down through the years has hosted

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,480
some real rock stars on Michael Buble

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,700
now I'm sure our speakers are far too

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,379
modest to ever refer to themselves as

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,420
rock stars even if at least one of them

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,800
still rocks a ponytail and another one

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,879
plays bass guitar but that's another

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,320
story

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
there is no denying though the enormous

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,219
respect and influence they have in the

29
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,660
profession and in the industry we're

30
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,460
absolutely privileged to have them I'm

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,780
going to steal a line in fact from

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,000
Cooper who many of you may know he's

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,739
been videoing our conferences for a

34
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,659
number of years and he said on Twitter

35
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,280
just recently

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,799
I count at least five names in the iris

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,299
Khan schedule who will be the main

38
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,820
speaker at any other conference Cooper

39
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,320
knows what he's talking about he covers

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,140
at least 30 security conferences a year

41
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,640
it's a hell of an endorsement but he's

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,439
absolutely right as soon as I saw the

43
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,240
lineup I was just absolutely couldn't

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,100
wait it's so you're in for a treat folks

45
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,540
you really are

46
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,520
now just to set the scene I'll set the

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,380
context for for a few minutes the

48
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,880
advantage of holding a conference late

49
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,860
in the year does does afford you a

50
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,720
chance to look back and I always like to

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,939
pick out some significant events and

52
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,680
moments in cyber security that we can

53
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,060
kind of look back on

54
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,820
obviously this is taking place against

55
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,799
the backdrop of an interesting year to

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,240
put it mildly

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
um Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led

58
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,280
to an uptick in damaging cyber attacks

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,320
that's not just me saying that recent

60
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,840
reports from the UK National cyber

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,360
security Center andanisa both name

62
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,360
checked this but um even close at home

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,939
there's Recent research by lhk an

64
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,380
insurance group here in Ireland I found

65
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,780
that 70 of companies with more than 100

66
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,940
employees had been affected in the last

67
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,800
year by some form of cyber threat or

68
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,780
invoice fraud and only a minority of

69
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,280
companies actually say they're extremely

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,020
confident of the steps they take to

71
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,520
avoid fraud

72
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,379
but I'm actually going to cheat when I

73
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,000
look back I'm going to go all the way

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
back to December 2021 still counts

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,660
because it happened after last year's

76
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,420
Iris Khan but you may remember in

77
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,280
December the Health Service executive

78
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,580
published a 157 page

79
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,739
post-incident review Into the Conti

80
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,360
ransomware incident it had suffered the

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,220
previous May a quick show of hands has

82
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,860
anybody seen or read the report

83
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,440
yeah quite a few quite a few so you'll

84
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,120
know then that it doesn't exactly cast

85
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,000
the HSE in the most flattering light and

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,099
the report's pretty honest about the

87
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,800
shortcomings and policies procedures and

88
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,560
quite open about what the HSE got wrong

89
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,300
so what's this got to do with Iris Khan

90
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,459
well since the very first Conference was

91
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,099
held not 500 meters from here back in

92
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,220
2009 a constant running theme has been

93
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,739
sharing information why do we share

94
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,120
information because it's what makes the

95
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,800
community better we understand the

96
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
threats that are out there we pull

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,819
resources everybody improves and

98
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,900
everybody gets a little bit better

99
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,280
protected

100
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,319
so I think the HSC deserves some credit

101
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
for publishing a report that frankly is

102
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,220
quite warts and all

103
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,599
they had a lot to lose if you think

104
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
about it I mean their major stakeholder

105
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,900
the government they could they could

106
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,459
certainly have lost a face not to

107
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,599
mention the public

108
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
but again I believe they did so in the

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,620
knowledge that this information being

110
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,940
out there in the public domain would

111
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,840
help to uh others to learn from absorb

112
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,700
the lessons and maybe do things better

113
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,159
themselves and improve keep in mind this

114
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,480
isn't always the prevailing culture and

115
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
security I don't know if you saw but

116
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,920
about a month or so ago in the U.S uh

117
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,959
Uber's former Chief information security

118
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,659
officer Joe Sullivan was convicted for

119
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,700
covering up the data breach that Uber

120
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,400
had had back in 2016 involving the loss

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,459
of 57 million customer records so this

122
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,500
idea of openness and transparency it

123
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,480
hasn't percolated totally through the

124
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
security Community but that culture is

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
changing and I believe

126
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,019
I can say this as a partial Outsider I

127
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,880
guess and I'm lucky enough to host this

128
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,918
but not being immersed in security all

129
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
the time but I think I research deserves

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,060
huge credits as well because since day

131
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,639
one they have been banging the drum for

132
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,380
information sharing that's how we make

133
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,020
the community better now I'm not kind of

134
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,699
saying that that makes them some kind of

135
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,740
security hipsters apologies if that word

136
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,360
is triggering for some people so let me

137
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
just put it this way they were doing

138
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,840
information sharing before it was cool

139
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,900
okay that hipster joke worked so much

140
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,120
better in their rehearsal so speak

141
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,180
speaking of

142
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,560
what rehearsal

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,060
speaking of Throwbacks to the earliest

144
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
days of the conference again remembering

145
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,560
2009 there was a strong law enforcement

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,940
presence there and I'm delighted to say

147
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,979
we've got speakers from angada Shia Kana

148
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,600
we've also got the national cyber

149
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,639
security center from Ireland and also

150
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,620
Anisa as well we're very honored to have

151
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,699
them

152
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,020
um and our diverse lineup of speakers

153
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,240
include some returning favorites and

154
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
some new names who are joining us here

155
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
for the first time

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,220
I'll introduce each of them in turn as

157
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,600
they come to the stage but just to give

158
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,860
you a little bit of a taster of what to

159
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,540
expect we're going to be covering things

160
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,039
like Security in The Internet of Things

161
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,500
ethical social engineering the evolution

162
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,560
of online crime Cloud security

163
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
ransomware of course at security

164
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,240
awareness for smes and so much more

165
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,500
now as well as the Fantastic

166
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,840
presentations happening right here we've

167
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,699
also got a challenge event in parallel

168

thanks Gordon and good morning everybody

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
don't worry I'm not going to speak for

better speakers here to to talk as well

226
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,500
I just want to Echo what Gordon has said

227
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,440
is that it's since last year it's been

228
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
an interesting year to say the least

229
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,039
I've been in cyber security and the

230
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,900
landscape out there has changed

231
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,720
significantly uh we as professionals

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,800
face a lot of challenges and that's why

233
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,539
events like this are so important is

234
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,639
that we not only get to hear and learn

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,220
from uh experienced professionals

236
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,139
talking about cyber security but we also

237
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,940
get to live to learn from each other

238
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,240
during the breaks and the the afterwards

239
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
as well that we have a chance to to

240
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,620
mingle and share experiences uh a key

241
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,300
message I think you heard from Gordon

242
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,460
and we'll hear from anger Corner Etc

243
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,440
later on is that we need to share

244
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,259
information uh that's the more we share

245
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,720
it the stronger we're going to get and

246
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,000
we're going to be able to to face the

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,919
time challenges of cyber criminals and

248
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
nation states that are out there

249
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,820
Gordon mentioned the the Russian

250
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,580
invasion of Ukraine causing uh change

251
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,679
the threat landscape we're also seeing

252
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,399
significant financial troubles ahead you

253
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,080
know Facebook announced yesterday the

254
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,420
the massive layoffs so there's going to

255
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,980
be downturn there's going to be lots of

256
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,040
people out of work who probably be

257
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,380
tempted to turn their hands to nefarious

258
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,660
means so the threat landscape is

259
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,959
continues to change and we need to be

260
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
able to work together and and share

261
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,680
things better so look welcome everybody

262
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,620
