1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,520
so

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,500
um Brian will tell you that I'm quite

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,059
cantankerous

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,099
actually I don't think he said that he

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,400
said something much worse but I am quite

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,279
opinionated and

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,440
my daughter says that you know

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,359
says worse but quite frankly the one

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,859
thing that annoys me more than anything

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,240
about this

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
wonderful industry that we work in is

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,240
one word

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,240
sophisticated

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,899
because we've all heard the term and and

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,880
typically what sophisticated means it's

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,680
a byproduct for

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,899
yeah there's nothing we could have done

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,660
and you know you've seen it before when

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,700
any attack happens typically what

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,860
happens is we know about the company

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,200
that's been compromised and the one

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
thing that everybody is desperate to

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,340
know is who did it

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,940
and we care about who did it not because

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,860
we want to learn about their ttps and

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,539
share that with the industry so we can

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,000
actually protect everybody no why we

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,640
care about that is because

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,520
it's interesting or perhaps for the

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
organization to be able to say there's

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,299
nothing we could have done this hack was

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,720
far too difficult for us to stop

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,420
I actually think

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,939
this is complete nonsense and

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,040
the reason why I think it is that is

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,080
because look we've all seen charts and

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,479
graphs like these in fact

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,580
um we produce that some time back but

39
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,820
ignoring the fact of that we see these

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,259
particular statistics and we hear about

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,079
these wonderful groups apt-40 Mustang

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,000
Panda fancy bear

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
and we wrap this up in this mystery that

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,720
we've got this

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
quite frankly nation-state groups that

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,259
are going out and carrying out attacks

47
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,420
they're using computers like

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,579
script kiddies or they're using attacks

49
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,579
like organized crime groups and

50
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,560
we kind of make this assumption that

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,659
because they are nation states because

52
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,640
they are doing the bidding of government

53
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,259
agent entities

54
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,360
that some way shape or form they are

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,259
more capable than anybody else out there

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,160
now a few years back I had a remarkable

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
opportunity to actually observe a

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,680
nation-state group in operation

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
see because the great thing about

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,239
working in the vendor space is

61
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm no longer a Cesar

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
and

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,980
but the downside of this is that

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,080
typically what will happen is if there

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,700
is any breach if there is any attack

66
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
anything that's even remotely successful

67
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,900
typically what happens is we get a phone

68
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,400
call and we say your software didn't

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
stop this ergo it is entirely your fault

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
and I will tell you that that happens

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,700
more times than I care to mention and

72
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,900
usually

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,239
it happens around about Christmas just

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,860
as I'm kind of settling in to start

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,120
eating and watching Polar Express

76
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,260
so a few years back I got a telephone

77
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,120
call from an organization and they said

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
look

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
we've been compromised and your

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
antivirus software didn't stop this

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,260
and I was like okay let's have a look at

82
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,540
it and typically the reason that this

83
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,280
happens is because

84
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,099
they need somebody to blame

85
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,019
usually it's their jobs on the line

86
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,080
usually it's the CEO or the CIO that's

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
saying well why did this happen and it's

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,379
of course it's much easier to blame the

89
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,480
vendor

90
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,800
and so what happened was there was a

91
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,900
long-term Espionage campaign that we

92
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,580
managed to uncover and all of this was

93
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,700
done really to try to determine how the

94
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,980
adversaries got in and fundamentally to

95
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,800
show the organization and say Hey look

96
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,959
maybe it wasn't just the technology that

97
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,760
was a failure perhaps

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,099
perhaps you have to shoulder some of the

99
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,799
responsibility as well that is a very

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
interesting conversation usually

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,420
now in this particular case it was

102
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,760
remarkable because as we started to

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,060
don't under undertake the analysis what

104
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,980
we found was that the the adversaries

105
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,980
had been in there for seven years

106
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,799
it was a nation-state group in operation

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,440
for seven years and part of the reason

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,480
why I think attribution matters and I'm

109
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,920
just you know going to get to this is

110
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,000
because

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
it was because we were able to attribute

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,399
this to a nation-state group that

113
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,779
finally this got the attention of the

114
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,738
CEO

115
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,899
because before it was just there's

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,460
anomalous Behavior there's anomalous

117
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,919
traffic and now all of a sudden it was

118
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
there are State secrets that are leaving

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
this organization and have been for

120
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,340
seven years

121
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,919
but of course we had to address

122
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,259
the elephant in the room which was why

123
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,240
did our antivirus software not stop a

124
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,240
nation-state group for seven years

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,860
so that was an interesting discussion

126
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,360
because of course

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
my first question was

128
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,259
hey there have been alerts in your

129
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,419
environment did you not think about

130
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,419
responding to them and the response I

131
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,759
got was yeah but we get a lot of alerts

132
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,560
said okay well what did you do with

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,740
these alerts oh we turned them off

134
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,479
it's still your fault by the way it's

135
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,300
like yeah I appreciate that

136
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
and then we had to do something

137
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,479
remarkable which actually has never

138
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:12,000
happened to me in my career because

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,040
typically from an incident response

140
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,479
perspective

141
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,759
the first thing that you want to do and

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,020
the first thing that the client wants

143
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,720
you to do is throw out the adversaries

144
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,460
get them out of my network now

145
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,419
it's reasonable

146
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,300
but the challenge is and this is the

147
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,220
biggest challenge we face is that in

148
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,539
this particular case and in most

149
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,160
particular cases

150
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,479
if there's an adversary in your

151
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,520
environment for seven years

152
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
they will establish additional

153
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,240
persistence mechanisms they'll have more

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,220
back doors in that particular

155
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,900
environment that you probably don't even

156
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,300
know about

157
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,460
and so we then had to have a very

158
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,699
awkward conversation with the CEO to say

159
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,400
do you mind leaving the actors in the

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,820
environment

161
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,020
sorry did you just say you want to leave

162
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,060
threat actors to continually steal

163
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,759
exfiltrate data that are Nathan's secret

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,400
and continue to watch them and let them

165
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,199
do it it's like yeah that's exactly what

166
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,360
we want to do

167
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,940
and I can tell you that you know we talk

168
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,699
about attribution as a kind of badge of

169
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,820
honor or as a vehicle to be able to say

170
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,960
well there's nothing we could have done

171
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,259
or perhaps to generate PR and press but

172
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,479
in this particular instance it was

173
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,340
imperative because

174
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,280
this actually allowed this particular

175
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
organization to acknowledge the fact

176
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
that they were dealing with a part in

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,120
the English but a sophisticated attacker

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,740
and by doing so we were able to identify

179
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,199
about 20 to 25 additional back doors

180
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,940
that we hadn't accounted for

181
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,520
and what was even more remarkable was we

182
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,960
actually found additional staging

183
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,060
servers and we actually found the data

184
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,800
that had been taken and stolen out of

185
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,720
this organization

186
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,940
and it became a hugely political issue

187
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,500
because the prime minister's office then

188
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,840
ended up sending Consultants on site to

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,340
double check our work to make sure we

190
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,239
were doing the right thing

191
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,699
but what it gave me for the first time

192
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,699
ever actually is the opportunity to sit

193
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,199
and actively watch

194
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,160
nation-state criminals and and not

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,199
hackers because I that term can't be

196
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,880
used for this but these are criminals

197
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,039
working on behalf of a nation-state

198
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,660
stealing information

199
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,400
and for the first time we actually got

200
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
to watch how they work I was actually

201
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,780
sitting on their shoulder

202
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,060
and and what I realized very quickly is

203
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,060
they don't actually work very hard

204
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,060
so

205
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,419
those are the hours they worked I mean I

206
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,520
don't know about you but that's a pretty

207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,659
decent work-life balance

208
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,460
because you don't work weekends and so

209
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,020
if you want to work for a nation-state

210
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,240
group working out of Southeast Asia

211
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,340
it's only like five days a week and you

212
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,720
only need to do a couple of hours now

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,000
and then and you just come in and steal

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
some data and then

215
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,860
go skiing or whatever you do right it's

216
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,280
I kind of realized that actually

217
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,580
we're not necessarily dealing with

218
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,139
the most

219
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,840
maybe the word is committed but

220
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,340
certainly not the most committed threat

221
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,960
actors out there

222
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,960
and of course when we start to consider

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,759
the types of threat groups and the type

224
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,340
of nation-states out there

225
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,560
we kind of make this assumption that

226
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,299
okay there's only maybe three or four

227
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,700
countries that are actually doing this I

228
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,279
mean if I was to say to you which nation

229
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,320
state groups are the most active

230
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,339
you would say

231
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,899
I heard of China

232
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,480
I heard of Russia right typically

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,680
countries that have red flags

234
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,420
[Laughter]

235
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,880
but the reality is and you know we

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
actually

237
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,779
fundamentally got an insight into this

238
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,180
Market into this industry with the

239
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,000
hacking team and the gamma exposures

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,740
because like citizen lab actually

241
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,040
published details of customers of

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,080
organizations that sell offensive cyber

243
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,760
tools

244
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,680
now this is the first time that we ever

245
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,959
got this and what we see and what we

246
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
witness is when we talk about nation

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
states we make the assumption that

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,700
they're all sophisticated

249
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700
but we never really talk about I don't

250
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,480
know

251
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,260
Mongolia as a threat actor group but

252
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,600
they were one of the customers we never

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,580
really talk about organelle countries

254
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,140
such as

255
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,640
Paraguay

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
and it kind of reminds me of that Lily

257
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Allen song like everybody's doing it so

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,399
why aren't we and

259
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,800
the harsh reality is when we talk about

260
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,540
nation-state groups when we talk about

261
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,420
sophisticated attackers

262
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,060
everybody is doing it

263
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,519
genuinely everybody is doing it

264
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,560
and if you don't have the internal

265
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,180
capabilities to develop the code

266
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,740
yourself

267
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,200
you can Outsource it and you can buy it

268
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,700
from commercial cyber security companies

269
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,500
maybe not cyber security companies but

270
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,180
you get the drift right

271
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,279
you can buy it from commercial companies

272
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,880
or

273
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,760
as we've learned you can basically

274
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,820
follow security researchers on Twitter

275
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,500
and download exploit code and then just

276
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,880
run that yourself

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,399
and so one of the things that I urge and

278
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,860
encourage us as an industry is to move

279
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,500
away from like rhetorics like this and

280
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,060
we've all seen this and we've all grown

281
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,279
up with this you know the capability

282
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,740
graph where people turn around and say

283
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,540
well there are script kitties and then

284
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,160
there are organized criminal gangs and

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,720
then you have nation state groups and

286
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,519
the level of capability goes up and down

287
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,980
depending on which bucket you sit in

288
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,480
it's

289
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,720
and it has been for a while

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,000
we need to start to accept the fact that

291
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,459
the cyber crime ecosystem

292
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,459
is made up of capable technical people

293
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,579
that are effectively guns for hire

294
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,200
and whether they're working for nation

295
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,700
states or whether they're working for

296
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,899
organized crime or whether they're

297
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,300
working for ransomware groups

298
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,700
ultimately it's a Payday for them and

299
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,200
we've kind of saw that with operation

300
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,540
Tovar a number of years back

301
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,940
you know so like we have to start to

302
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,860
move away from this and you know when we

303
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,620
start to think about this that's part of

304
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,240
the reason why we're seeing a level of

305
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
capability and investment and Innovation

306
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,200
from ransomware groups really escalate

307
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,040
and go through the roof

308
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,519
so you all remember Colonial pipeline

309
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,519
Colonial pipeline of course was the um

310
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
dark side or black matter ransomware

311
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,760
group

312
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,560
and historically we would have been told

313
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,140
well you know these groups are lower or

314
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,720
less capable than nation states and of

315
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,240
course back in the past ransomware was

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
well we'll send an email and somebody

317
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,779
will click on it

318
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,660
but actually if you look at the level of

319
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,459
capability and the kill chain that is

320
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,459
used by ransomware groups it is actually

321
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,560
really quite capable

322
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,079
so this is the dark side uh modus

323
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,399
operandi

324
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,260
and what we see in what we witness and

325
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,180
and this is why security has become so

326
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,200
difficult

327
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,279
is the tools that they're using aren't

328
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,860
malware per se they're not you know

329
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,240
known bad

330
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
they're using Enterprise tools against

331
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,540
you

332
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,940
and the challenge required to protect

333
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,640
against these types of attacks

334
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
is to cut outwards to identify the

335
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,140
signal in the noise

336
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,959
if you use RDP in your environment they

337
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,040
do as well

338
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,579
if you're using VNC they do as well how

339
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,800
do you determine amongst the 27 000

340
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,380
Powershell you know implementations in

341
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820
the environment the two or three that

342
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,519
are actually got a malicious payload

343
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,519
much like today we're seeing the growth

344
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,700
and rise in data exfiltration

345
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,320
if you remember a couple of years back

346
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,180
when Kaspersky published the carbonack

347
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,620
report these were attacks against

348
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,079
Eastern European Banks and I think the

349
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,720
urban myth goes there was a CSO that

350
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,399
actually saw data leaving his

351
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,959
environment and for some reason it was

352
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,519
going to China and he said oh that's odd

353
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,320
that shouldn't be going there and that

354
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,500
kind of begun the investigation

355
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,959
that's not happening anymore

356
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,060
the exfiltration of data are using

357
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,279
Enterprise tools like our clone and

358
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,519
sending it to legitimate cloud services

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
and so if you're filtering or you're

360
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,440
looking for you know traffic to known

361
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,380
malicious C2 infrastructure

362
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,000
that's not happening because what

363
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,380
they're doing is they're using your

364
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,540
tools against you

365
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,339
now I would argue this is sophisticated

366
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,839
but it doesn't look sophisticated does

367
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,899
it because it's not an O day it's not a

368
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,300
pegasus spyware it's not a hundred

369
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,040
thousand dollars to kind of carry out an

370
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
attack what it is

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
it's using tools that we use every

372
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,060
single day against us

373
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,240
and our challenge as an industry is to

374
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
be able to identify amongst the millions

375
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,740
and millions of events that you get a

376
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,279
day the two or three or four

377
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,160
that are potentially malicious

378
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
and I will tell you the challenges that

379
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,899
these attacks are only increasing and

380
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,519
the number of alerts that we have in the

381
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,519
environment are only increasing

382
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,100
you know as Dave and Miko have said

383
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,380
earlier the number of systems we have in

384
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,079
our in our own homes are going up

385
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,839
let alone our own environment and you

386
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,160
know remember

387
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,100
I I used to give a talk on iot and I was

388
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,720
I always used to ask the audience and I

389
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,579
said how many iot or how many IP

390
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,079
addresses or how many devices do you

391
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,279
have in your home

392
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,180
and on average it was about 20 to 25.

393
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,880
I think I'm at about 65 now most of them

394
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,860
in my daughter's bedroom

395
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,480
and there was one guy that put his hand

396
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
up he says I have 250.

397
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,800
well that's like I bet you're single

398
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,519
laughs

399
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,300
but that's the challenge

400
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,399
Even in our own homes the number of

401
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,740
devices we have that are going up and in

402
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,240
our own environments they're going up

403
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,459
and all of these devices are creating

404
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,680
alerts and every single one of those

405
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,899
alerts that I've seen when I get called

406
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,100
in to do incidents are being ignored

407
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,160
and it's not just nation-state attacks

408
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,320
um the soda nakibi gang carried out an

409
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,940
attack against an organization I had to

410
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,100
investigate again blaming me for their

411
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,060
failing

412
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,699
and I had to tell them and I said well

413
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,620
judging by the investigation the

414
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,060
attackers have been in your environment

415
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,980
for seven months

416
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,139
and they compromise an external RDP

417
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,459
server to get in

418
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,500
the response from the CIO is it's still

419
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,699
your fault

420
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,800
is it all right you do know the password

421
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,139
that you had on your external RDP server

422
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,420
was welcome one two three his response

423
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,820
was still your fault

424
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,440
and that's the challenge that we face

425
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
within the industry today

426
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,820
the same tools the same miter attack

427
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,980
techniques the same capabilities that

428
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,420
are being used by nation states are

429
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,699
being used by ransomware groups why

430
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,199
because it works and because it's

431
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,019
successful it's a darn site easier to

432
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,040
use

433
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,980
our clone than it is to send it to a

434
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,660
established an infrastructure hosted

435
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,399
somewhere Shady at a bulletproof hosting

436
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,860
site and potentially get blocked

437
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
that's the challenge that we're facing

438
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,639
within the industry today

439
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,820
and thread actors today

440
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,339
I have to stress

441
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,420
are watching what we do as an industry

442
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,339
the biggest issue we face today is the

443
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,000
asymmetry of information we as the

444
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,500
Defenders

445
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,259
publish exploits on online we release

446
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,500
stuff on GitHub we talk about and we

447
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,880
release vulnerabilities out there

448
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,339
usually on a Friday night at 4 30. thank

449
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,079
you very much

450
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:55,680
um

451
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
and the threat actors are out there and

452
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,639
they're watching what we do and we've

453
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,500
seen that we've seen the use of tools

454
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,439
you know this particular attack was

455
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,500
um the Microsoft DDE issue and within

456
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,179
four weeks of that vulnerability being

457
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,980
posted we actually saw activity from

458
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,919
fancy bear targeting organizations in

459
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,959
Western Europe

460
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,599
they don't need to buy o days they don't

461
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,760
need to develop exploits because we do

462
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,619
that for them

463
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,780
and there is no way that we're going to

464
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,099
get around it because we need our

465
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,959
followers especially now that we're a

466
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,460
mastodon and we have nothing and we're

467
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,440
starting from zero but that's the

468
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
reality it that's the reality of the

469
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,799
situation that we have

470
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,539
is there is this asymmetry of

471
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,039
information

472
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,559
and so my ask of all of us today is

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,940
simple

474
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,280
when we start to think about

475
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,179
attribution when we start to think about

476
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,559
who's actually behind the attacks and

477
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,940
we've heard about data sharing we've

478
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,160
heard about information sharing

479
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,419
first of all if we're going to be

480
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:55,980
sharing information let's make it

481
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,039
actionable let's make it usable

482
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,600
if we're going to be talking about

483
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,480
threat actors let's start to share the

484
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,059
ttps that are used by the groups

485
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,860
right

486
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,400
let's because this sounds crazy but

487
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,320
many of these threat groups and these

488
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,620
apt groups do have

489
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,660
not necessarily a signature set but they

490
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,059
do have an MMO

491
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,620
moreover if we're going to be sharing

492
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,539
information let's talk about the tools

493
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,820
that they're using and if you're going

494
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,520
to be using an MDR provider if you're

495
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
going to be using a cyber security

496
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,419
company talk to them about the fact and

497
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,760
say hey look we don't use mimikats in

498
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,440
our environment for red teaming so if

499
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,940
you see that in the network you can

500
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,500
block it

501
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,080
as part of the onboarding

502
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,840
iocs let's actively start to share this

503
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,419
information amongst us as an industry

504
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,460
and let's make it more difficult for

505
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,020
them

506
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,880
you might recall a couple of years back

507
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,980
there was these you know DDOS extortion

508
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,960
tactics and they were going after the

509
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,140
U.S sorry UK financial sector and they

510
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,419
went after Bank One Bank two bank three

511
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,299
and Bank four using the same Mo the same

512
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,919
tactics

513
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
that can be stopped if we're just a

514
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,360
little bit more open about what we share

515
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,320
and the timeliness of sharing that

516
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,340
thank you very much

517
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,260
any time or did you wanna

518
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,320
it's okay

519
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,020
the track like that

520
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,880
hey how's it going I have very good talk

521
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,620
there thank you just just a quick one in

522
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,160
regards to the Deep Harvest aspect so

523
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,919
he's found additional 25 back doors

524
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,780
there and obviously you were noticing

525
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,980
that they weren't really monitoring

526
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,660
inside the environment when you started

527
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,100
closing those back doors was there an

528
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,020
influx of the activity or

529
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,140
yeah so actually we had to do we had to

530
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,960
um plan what we call a strike day

531
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,880
um and so one weekend what we had to do

532
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,220
was we had to effectively bring

533
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,320
everybody on site we had to do a

534
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,179
Kerberos golden ticket reset because we

535
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,559
were concerned that well they have

536
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,059
completely poned the active directory

537
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,340
environment we identified those back

538
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,220
doors and then that one day

539
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,200
everything was shut

540
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
because the challenge was uh and if you

541
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,520
remember I think it was the bank of

542
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,799
Taiwan heist where they used Hermes

543
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
ransomware to cover their track what we

544
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,039
were concerned about was

545
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,780
if they knew that we were onto them they

546
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,280
were going to burn the environment so

547
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,559
the strike they had to be coordinated in

548
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,559
a way that we closed everything off shut

549
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,480
out shut them out as quickly as we could

550
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,640
and then monitor the environment to make

551
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,440
sure that we hadn't missed anything but

552
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,679
um yeah that was a very very stressful

553
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,179
weekend

554
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,980
I can imagine and did you see any

555
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,419
activity of them trying to get back in

556
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,919
or was it just once it was closed they

557
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,620
kind of just gave up

558
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,000
all right well I haven't named the

559
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
customer so I haven't named the

560
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,660
organization so I can say that we hadn't

561
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,880
seen them go back and then all of the

562
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620
work that we said well once this is done

563
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,880
we're then going to go through an

564
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,400
exercise with you around rebuilding your

565
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,900
environment strengthening your security

566
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,700
and you have to do investment they said

567
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,159
yeah thanks we'll get back to you so I

568
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,080
expect a call but

569
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,059
um I don't know when it's going to

570
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,980
happen but yeah as far as they were

571
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,480
concerned it was fine but what was

572
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,080
interesting was we actually got the iocs

573
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,700
um and then we tracked the prevalence of

574
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,260
the campaign across the globe because

575
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,480
obviously we had like Global Telemetry

576
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,880
and the campaign that we saw wasn't just

577
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,679
directed at that one organization it was

578
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,659
actually a global campaign against

579
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,320
defense contractors all across uh Asia

580
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,780
and Western Europe so they're still

581
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,159
active and the same tools were being

582
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,320
used but we published all of the iocs

583
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,480
and made it available to all of our

584
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,840
competitors as well perfect thank you

585
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,399
anyways I think you've got one more

586
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,520
hi there um you mentioned that uh

587
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,260
adversaries are using more living off

588
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,539
the land and Cloud infrastructure

589
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,760
does that imply then that attribution is

590
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,679
getting harder over time or are we just

591
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,679
moving on to different methods

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,559
that's a great question

593
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,678
um

594
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,659
using with technical indicators is a

595
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,580
Fool's errand

596
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,940
um and so we're actually

597
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,440
reevaluating our attribution policy but

598
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,740
what we can do is we can use uh during

599
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,980
that earliest earlier pyramid and start

600
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,539
to indicate or have confidence

601
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,220
indicators as to who we believe to be

602
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,260
behind that one thing that we've made a

603
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,880
decision on is we won't actually say it

604
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,400
was country a or country B we say a

605
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
level of confidence and the likely

606
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,520
threat group behind it

607
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,980
you know we're not we're not law

608
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,059
enforcement we're not the government

609
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,860
we're not here to point fingers at

610
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,780
countries what we are there to do though

611
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,299
is reveal the methodologies that we

612
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,220
believe specific threat groups are using

613
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,020
and share that methodology with the

614
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,700
industry so yeah we're quite circumspect

615
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
about it

616
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,159
um for that reason

617
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,400
all right

618
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,960
thank you very much thank you
