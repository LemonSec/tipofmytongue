1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,080
good afternoon folks I've got what I

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,340
call the graveyard shift just before

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,260
lunch so I'll try not to keep it too

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,040
long

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,559
um I'm new to this game I'll be very

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,880
upfront about it

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,379
um my background is primarily an

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,480
economic crime that didn't involve

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,180
securing and presenting digital evidence

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,340
um but I suppose

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,019
as opposed to many of the speakers here

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,240
today many attendees here today the clue

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,980
is in our name we're a crime

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,080
investigation Bureau so

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,719
um we offer advice I'm engaging people

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,700
regarding security but our primary

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,739
function is to prevent detect and

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,559
investigate crime okay and cyber crime

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,360
is no different to any other crime

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,719
oh so where we just to give you the

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,760
background not too much obviously um

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,500
we're part of organizing serious

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,539
criminal and garden Chicana and I

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,460
suppose most of you would recognize the

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,899
names of some of the units here they're

26
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:55,980
rather than that what we know as a

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,120
national detective units such as

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,579
immigration Bureau of criminal

29
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,500
investigation economic crime Bureau and

30
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,180
we sit under the control of the

31
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,680
assistant commissioner and organize the

32
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,180
serious claim

33
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,920
again you can see our roles prevention

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,860
detection and investigation of crime

35
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,799
we've I suppose one of our strongest and

36
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,060
primary functions is from computer

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,979
forensics we assist our other National

38
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,140
units

39
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,119
regarding a vast array of crime to such

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
what I suppose are a function from an

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,140
investigative point of view

42
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,780
would be cyber dependent

43
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,259
types of crime okay so again this is

44
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,520
what we as I said before this is where

45
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,100
we sit in the organization we

46
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,780
um would love to have three detector

47
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,040
inspectors more we don't we've only got

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,939
two

49
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,540
um

50
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
we've divided up our various I suppose

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,900
sides of the house with what we do you

52
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,520
can see here we've a computer forensic

53
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
side try adding

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,360
and we have recently which I'll get on

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,439
to the next slide now is that I've

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,060
developed satellite hubs and we continue

57
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
to expand and I suppose to try and keep

58
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,979
up with the game such

59
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,399
so um really what we've been doing the

60
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,960
last number of years is trying to expand

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,479
our investigative side as part of that

62
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,040
we now have satellite hubs throughout

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,799
the country we have four currently

64
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,258
um we have Mullingar Which is closest we

65
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,800
have cork Wexford and Galway we have

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,560
plans to develop a further Hub in the

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,060
cavern area

68
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,580
and as we expand further we intend to

69
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,200
have an actual Hub in Dublin as well

70
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,120
because primarily as the national Europe

71
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,459
in Dublin we tend to focus on the and

72
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,620
the Dublin related crime and tasks

73
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,360
when you're looking I'm actually wearing

74
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
a suit today because we're in the

75
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,440
process of moving premises and we'd all

76
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,420
have hard hats on and jeans on the last

77
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,400
couple of weeks so along with the other

78
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,260
National detective units we're now

79
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
moving to a purpose-built facility in

80
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,620
Military Road just up to Houston Station

81
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,440
that's ongoing that will allow us to

82
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,640
expand

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,459
um and I suppose one of the I haven't

84
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,720
spoke to another people at our stand

85
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,739
today

86
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,940
um many people are asking about

87
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,440
Recruitment and how they would you know

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,379
join the cyber crime Bureau or popular

89
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,000
options and one of the things the

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,620
organization is looking at and hopefully

91
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,959
in quarter one quarter two is to employ

92
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,660
uh civilian forensic analysts however

93
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,860
you don't have to be powerful and guard

94
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,680
a Chicana or a swollen member you can

95
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,000
apply directly and that's one of the

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
things that will be coming online in q1

97
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,239
Q2

98
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,879
um and what I'd say in general is

99
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,640
um from our perspective our goal is to

100
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
ensure that at every level in the

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
organization somebody has somebody has

102
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,300
some form of cyber knowledge

103
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,800
to the two o'clock in the morning for

104
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,360
initial Rose new cards your local Garden

105
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,879
station at least the memory you meet

106
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,340
will have the idea of the first steps

107
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,500
that need to be taken and thereafter

108
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,900
our specialist units would step in so

109
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,459
that's part of our role is to ensure

110
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,379
that members that you meet on the

111
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,819
database have some sort of cyber

112
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,040
knowledge about crime and about how to

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,980
react to it as I said

114
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,140
we have our satellite hubs as well and

115
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,760
we also are training digital evidence

116
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,980
First Responders that will go out to the

117
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,140
sites of of searches

118
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,879
um crimes Etc and be able to secure

119
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,659
evidence in that regard

120
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,099
so there I suppose there are primary

121
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,260
functions that set out there to provide

122
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,400
support

123
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
our forensics are very obviously is a

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,780
very very important part of what we do

125
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,840
um and obviously to educate and engage

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,459
with our stakeholders and attempt to

127
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,040
prevent crime and obviously then as I

128
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
said we're trying to expand our

129
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,440
investigations such as a previous

130
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,620
speaker's program ransomware attacks Etc

131
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,000
um

132
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,740
I suppose that's our operating model has

133
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,600
kind of covered that ground already

134
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,540
um you know we we at the lowest level I

135
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,220
said we we want to train all our members

136
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,259
to have some sort of cyber knowledge

137
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,840
and our hopes perform a very very

138
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
important parts of our plans now to have

139
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,740
a more localized response to these

140
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,699
issues

141
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,280
and obviously then ourselves then at the

142
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
top tier then you know we look at policy

143
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,639
and expansion and you know legislation

144
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,160
that we can use software techniques

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
Hardware all those things we examine um

146
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,940
constantly we engage with external

147
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,400
partners and also with our own I.T

148
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,199
within and the Department of Justice

149
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,740
Anna garage

150
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,840
so um many of you will see I'm going to

151
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,860
show you next

152
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,600
um and a lot of the other speakers have

153
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
covered this I mean cyber crime is a

154
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
matter of perception and

155
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,960
cyber attacks are a matter of perception

156
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,699
so

157
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,800
if you look here

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,020
that's what we see so very often when we

159
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,759
look at we look inwardly at what we're

160
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,539
doing

161
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,320
um

162
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,780
how we're protecting ourselves

163
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,479
we very very often see only what we're

164
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,940
doing I'm not not what we haven't done

165
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,940
okay so

166
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,340
if I ask to Define four circles there

167
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,060
okay

168
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,520
and all I'm saying about that is that

169
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,300
very very often and we we focus on you

170
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,580
know what we can stop

171
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,320
we need to look what we can stop what we

172
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,419
haven't done what can we do what more

173
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,520
can we do what who else can we engage

174
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,799
with what controls be putting in place

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
um as I said my previous background is

176
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,360
an economic crime and um

177
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,820
you could you could apply this quote

178
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,460
um from Robert Miller to say we had a

179
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,860
saying back in the day that there are

180
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,080
those companies who have been defrauded

181
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
and those companies who don't know

182
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
they've been defrauded and there is a

183
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,539
mirror to cyber attacks as well

184
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,500
um

185
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,660
and there's also those who have been

186
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,160
hacked and don't know they've been

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,060
hacked

188
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,740
as in the now Okay so

189
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,139
we need to be aware

190
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,060
of the tracks

191
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
and when we identify the threats and we

192
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,479
realize Something's Happened we need to

193
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,919
take action and that's where we come in

194
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,919
very much after the fact

195
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,780
so the type of crimes that we're seeing

196
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,160
primarily

197
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,759
um so on the left are what we call

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,080
generally cyber neighbor crimes or

199
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,580
normal crimes but they'll involve a

200
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,039
cyber element and obviously the vast

201
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,979
majority of what we see

202
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,380
is Choice sexual abuse material okay and

203
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,960
that probably takes us 60 of what we

204
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,100
deal with

205
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,199
from a friend forensic perspective in

206
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,479
particular now

207
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,639
very often we'd assist with Gathering

208
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,840
evidence and respect to those matters

209
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,819
but again with other National units such

210
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,620
as the national Protective Service

211
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,780
Bureau and local Protective Services

212
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,000
units will actually investigate those we

213
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,220
will provide a backup service on a role

214
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,039
in in securing evidence

215
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,319
any type of crime the biggest thing

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,020
we'll see nowadays every crime organized

217
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,180
crime how they communicate with each

218
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,940
other drugs extortion

219
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,620
all of these now have a cyber element

220
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,240
which is the huge change obviously we're

221
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,180
seeing in the organization there's very

222
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,520
very few serious crimes that have been

223
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,720
investigated that don't have a cyber

224
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,280
element if somebody hasn't used a laptop

225
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,099
to communicate all these matters okay

226
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,940
and then

227
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,740
mirroring what our previous speaker said

228
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,199
we're obviously are engaged with the

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,240
investigation around somewhere and and

230
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,460
and information attacks as well and

231
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,440
that's our primary investigative

232
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,259
responsibility there

233
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
looked and these are some figures

234
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,280
obviously um I think the counter group

235
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,940
we are estimated to have made 150 plus

236
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,220
they think at this stage

237
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,960
um and varying amounts of phishing

238
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,319
attacks you know phishing attacks can be

239
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,819
anybody that's engaging

240
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,039
any company that has to engage in an

241
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
individual or an organization or anybody

242
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,299
that's expecting contact from an

243
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,919
individual or an organization is open to

244
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,200
an attack it could be 100 euros it could

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,919
be 150 000 Euros for a CEO fraud or

246
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,799
um so because of the world today we're

247
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,540
constantly communicating with service

248
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,200
providers energy providers Banks

249
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,959
and anybody who's engaging or expecting

250
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,220
um contact

251
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,680
I know isn't I suppose Terror

252
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
is open to attack

253
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,080
um if I just get I suppose there's two

254
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,420
key messages today

255
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,480
um and one of them is this message

256
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,380
um

257
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,480
because we're a law enforcement agency I

258
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,580
suppose that's that's our business

259
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,300
um

260
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,980
our position is that you shouldn't pay

261
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,899
around them and I know that's

262
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,220
I know our previous speaker spoke about

263
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,220
the economic implications

264
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,480
um for a small to medium-sized firm

265
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,980
we're paying around some resultant end

266
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,180
of business

267
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,360
what we would say is that there is no

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,740
guarantee that your data will be

269
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,480
decrypted

270
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,260
there is no guarantee that your data or

271
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,260
certain data won't be leaked

272
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,940
it leads to in the center for

273
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,200
criminality

274
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,300
and I think one of our first speakers

275
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,300
the smart Amico mentioned um

276
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
in his country in Finland there's less

277
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,040
armed robberies now than ever

278
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,160
there's a reason for that

279
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
it's not lucrative this is okay

280
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,600
so

281
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
what I'd say is that

282
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,580
you ultimately by paying ransomware

283
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,620
you're supporting criminality and I and

284
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,180
I appreciate that's easier said and done

285
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,580
so our position and position of law

286
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,019
enforcement ages you shouldn't pay

287
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,399
Ransom

288
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,600
okay

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,760
I get it first in some cases it's very

290
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,320
much an economic rather than a moral

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,880
decision but that's that's our position

292
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,740
and that's one of the messages probably

293
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,880
we would like to convey today

294
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,700
um as I spoken previously

295
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,680
the way in which we engage with outside

296
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,320
agencies the way in which our lives have

297
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,580
changed

298
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,420
um

299
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,360
you know banking from a phone

300
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,600
banking from text messages alerts about

301
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,279
attacks

302
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,579
don't log in please log into this all of

303
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:51,720
these

304
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,880
um our interactions now are subject to

305
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,579
disruption and we can see from energy

306
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,899
providers

307
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,380
banking all these where people are on a

308
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,620
day-to-day basis have become immune to

309
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,240
engaging with people at a very very

310
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
simple level

311
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,620
you know on an individual basis we need

312
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,180
to be aware

313
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,640
and then on an organizational basis when

314
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,339
we received unsolicited Communications

315
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,140
you know do we need to have our CEO's

316
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,320
email on our website you know do we are

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
we checking emails that are coming in

318
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,320
having a mailbox that's filtered

319
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,660
are we examining email addresses

320
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,740
correctly

321
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,320
heavy processes in place

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,019
to say that you know a two three-step

323
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,760
process regarding processing payments

324
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,399
all of these issues any weakness in that

325
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,540
regard will be exploited

326
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,000
there's a few um I suppose

327
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,420
and be very very careful as well as

328
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,420
very often the weaknesses in what

329
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,899
happens or when we're victims are people

330
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,940
and as a result of that when I say that

331
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,740
automatically

332
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,320
um we need as a police force we thrive

333
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,880
on intelligence and we Thrive and engage

334
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,820
on time we thrive on people reporting to

335
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,380
us and speaking to us from the lowest

336
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,940
level to the highest level

337
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,220
so when we say the people Factor we're

338
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
very very conscious then straight away

339
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,620
if somebody has made a mistake clicked

340
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,820
on something they shouldn't have clicked

341
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,920
are not far on the protocol straight

342
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,040
away we're in blame territory okay

343
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
but

344
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,500
um

345
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,320
very very often

346
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,019
very often the weakness lies in people

347
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,880
not in systems we can improve our

348
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,800
systems and we can identify

349
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,680
and we can be self-aware that our

350
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,440
systems are not 100 watertight but we're

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,019
aware of that we can identify it we can

352
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,399
very hard for us to identify the people

353
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,480
Factor

354
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,320
um

355
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,899
I spoke with somebody uh not that long

356
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,120
after my arrival into cyber crime and

357
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
they gave the analogy of

358
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,120
um

359
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
someday you go on and you're very

360
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
exciting by your first house on your

361
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,300
first house you walk in you go I'd like

362
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,279
a TV there I'd like a sofa there I'd

363
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,660
like a table there

364
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,480
someday I'll afford also those solid

365
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,160
walnut floors

366
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,380
you get all that done and you're just so

367
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,560
happy and you get a nice rug and 45 inch

368
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,600
TV surround sound everything then you

369
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,459
look around your house and you go

370
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,040
hmm not quite sure about that garden

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,899
fence I think I'll build a wall

372
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,760
you build a wall

373
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,380
you feel a bit more secure in your home

374
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,120
then you know I think I got a gate at

375
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,940
the front can you save up your body gate

376
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,279
then you then you get really really

377
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,320
aware you might have young children I

378
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,700
need to get an alarm in my house when

379
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,380
you get an alarm in your house and you

380
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,480
think I made then your neighbor gets to

381
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,980
that will either monitored alarm you get

382
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,860
your you get a monitor of the lamp

383
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,800
then you go hmm that guy three doors up

384
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,420
has CCTV

385
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,000
you get CCTV put in

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,279
you might get a ring doorbell

387
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,139
the main doorbell

388
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,839
if you're like me and you have a 16 year

389
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,180
old boy whose head is in the ground and

390
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,579
he's and he's and he's the first he's

391
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,959
the last person to leave the house in

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,519
the morning and he doesn't turn the

393
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,779
alarm on

394
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,060
you've raised a lot of money

395
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
so

396
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
that's the people Factor he's a great

397
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,700
kid sorry but uh

398
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,300
um you can I I can't I can't allow for a

399
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,260
fact

400
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,200
despite repeat fair to fade with them if

401
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,519
he doesn't turn the alarm on in the

402
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,480
morning

403
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,600
if he doesn't follow the protocols I

404
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,459
don't want that type of houses okay but

405
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,380
if he if he doesn't follow protocol so

406
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,880
he doesn't you know do what he's

407
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,100
supposed to do if he doesn't follow the

408
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,680
process is that the company has put in

409
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,420
place

410
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,579
you have an issue okay and that's the

411
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,920
people Factor okay

412
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,779
um so you can see there's a list of um

413
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,540
you know the processes are there

414
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,360
and very often we're aware of the

415
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,180
processes we're aware of the weaknesses

416
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,800
maybe our own

417
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
Pride will tell us where we were 90 you

418
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,839
can see down about where 90 there we

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,600
forget about the 10 but

420
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,320
um

421
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,260
I'm in the room and I've had experts are

422
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,420
speaking today on security these are

423
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,639
just our observations and my these

424
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,139
observations take back from my time in

425
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,699
economic crime investigation where

426
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,980
people thought they were watertight and

427
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,160
then

428
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:26,339
or they realized when they engaged

429
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,260
somebody from a security perspective

430
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,180
that those things weren't watertight so

431
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,240
it's just something to be aware of

432
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,940
looked many of the beware of these

433
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,399
um pointers smart pointers you know

434
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,920
restrict public facing information okay

435
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,560
again this gets back to the fact that

436
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,180
we're in a society where we want to

437
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,040
engage with people we want people to see

438
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
what we do we want to sell ourselves

439
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,579
we're very very conscious about

440
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,380
information you put out in public when

441
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,579
there's not and make sure there's

442
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,560
controls about it

443
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,500
um simple things like passwords

444
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,720
Authentication

445
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,519
all those type of things protect your

446
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,139
online meetings

447
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,720
again most common ones it was commonly

448
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
referred to CEO frauds

449
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
be aware of emails coming in

450
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,279
you know don't assess them either

451
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,100
privately or as an entity beware

452
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,740
everyone solicited emails

453
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,959
back to processes ensure that the

454
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,420
software you have is updated and the

455
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,040
latest available

456
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,620
and the last thing which is part of what

457
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,199
we get onto now ourselves is um

458
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,000
tell

459
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,560
tell somebody internally and

460
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,120
accidentally certainly the right people

461
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,220
that something has happened and the

462
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,019
second I suppose the second key message

463
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,339
from today

464
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,800
I would say and I can answer his report

465
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,699
report report

466
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,079
we have a number of examples that might

467
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,600
obviously the the game when we don't we

468
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,740
can't name names or speak about

469
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,740
individual cases but I mean We've ran

470
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,000
somewhere for a large engineering

471
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,560
company

472
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,300
um via fishing

473
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,759
letter privileged escalation by the by

474
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,419
the by the suspects within the systems

475
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,819
exploitated that amount of data last

476
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,540
currently are known suspects identified

477
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,740
investigation ongoing

478
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,119
a solicitors firm 1.1 million and

479
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,819
again see what was commonly referred to

480
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,339
as the CEO type fraud where an email

481
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,260
proportionably from somebody internally

482
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,900
wasn't and led to the transfer of funds

483
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,419
phones were not recovered

484
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,080
um and suspect has been identified

485
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,700
so there's look there's a number of

486
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,020
Statistics there

487
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,539
um I'm just I suppose there's quite a

488
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,220
lot there I'll pick out a couple

489
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,780
um

490
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,360
I suppose the main thing is I'm getting

491
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,440
back to reporting from our perspective

492
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,179
those that paid Ransom

493
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,039
according to recent reports eight

494
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,559
percent got their data back

495
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,620
25 got less than half

496
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,179
and I suppose the most frightening is

497
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,880
like we believe that's only concerning

498
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
19 of the actual instances only 19 are

499
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,820
reported okay

500
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,679
um

501
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,900
I suppose the the key

502
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,640
um the key

503
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,860
take away the second key takeaway is the

504
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,059
reporting of these matters

505
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,039
um and I go back to the house

506
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,380
um hopefully I'll get home safe today

507
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,640
and you wake up tomorrow morning

508
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,440
everything is fine but let's just say

509
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,200
one of you wakes up tomorrow morning and

510
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,299
you look out on the street outside where

511
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,340
your car is parked and the wing mirror

512
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,260
is broken on your car

513
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,299
now the first reaction is

514
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,220
first reaction is oh

515
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,620
second reaction is I've got to get to

516
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,520
work

517
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,020
somebody's after work and body during

518
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,520
the night to kick the wing mirror off my

519
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,620
car

520
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,880
I mean the police the guards how long

521
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,740
will it take for them to get here I'm in

522
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,620
a real hurry hmm I don't have I haven't

523
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,780
got the ring doorbell in this case I

524
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,419
haven't got CCTV it probably happened at

525
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,620
three o'clock in the morning there's

526
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,440
nobody around

527
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,140
will I report it I'll think about it

528
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,520
maybe I'll report this evening but if I

529
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
go this evening it'll be it might be a

530
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,520
cue at the police station

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,039
uh no I won't report it okay

532
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,240
let's just say in your housing estate

533
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,179
that's happened eight times that night

534
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,640
and everyone had the same attitude as

535
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,419
you

536
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,860
I can tell you haven't been an

537
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,799
operational policing six months ago

538
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,600
that the following morning the local

539
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,940
superintendent is having a meeting about

540
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,120
what's happened in the previous 24 hours

541
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,500
and

542
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,240
he doesn't know anything about your car

543
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,280
being broken being broken outside your

544
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,620
house he doesn't know anything about the

545
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,660
other eight people

546
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,179
so as far as he's concerned it hasn't

547
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,580
happened so

548
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,740
now I know for a woman are telling you

549
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,299
that every wing mirror

550
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,700
that's broken in a car leads to somebody

551
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,020
being cut

552
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,140
or but what I can do

553
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,480
is it can allow ourselves and other law

554
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,100
enforcement agencies to know what's

555
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,059
happened

556
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,360
to analyze Trends to see

557
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
can we take preventative action

558
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,679
can we anticipate

559
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
can we increase our knowledge with how

560
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,299
to investigate matters can we find new

561
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,880
ways of securing evidence can we meet

562
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,860
people along the way who've had similar

563
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,280
experiences so from that perspective I

564
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,679
have a list of reasons there why we say

565
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:31,020
please report okay

566
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,760
and I'm not for women are telling you

567
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,559
that every time you report a crime of

568
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,380
any type that the culprit will be cut

569
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,580
okay but increasingly police work has

570
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,200
become about crime analysis and

571
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
anticipation and also

572
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,940
believe it or not we have finite

573
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,640
resources people think we don't what we

574
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
do but we need to deploy our resources

575
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
effectively the same way a private

576
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,000
sector or the public sector bodies use

577
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,620
their resources as effectively as

578
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,679
possible we need to do that too okay and

579
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,559
if we see increasing Trends and if my

580
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
chief superintendent is looking for more

581
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,480
staff or more

582
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,360
um resources we need to be able to say

583
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,919
well that particular type of crime is

584
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,840
increasing we need to address it okay so

585
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
I would encourage you

586
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,100
um privately and as part of your your

587
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,740
companies and your entities to please

588
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,620
report and engage with us okay and at

589
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,020
least at the very least it's a knowledge

590
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,179
sharing exercise

591
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,020
um

592
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,419
and that's and as I suppose as law

593
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,220
enforcement that has to be our position

594
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,039
we we need crime reported we don't

595
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,260
nobody likes to hear the crime is

596
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,419
increasing in any area or any country or

597
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,480
any in any particular field because

598
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,260
um

599
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,020
I suppose the the flip side of that is

600
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,220
then there's an element well have we

601
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,620
failed in some way but we need to know

602
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,480
what's happening okay and in order to

603
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,980
build our response and build our

604
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,900
expertise and our knowledge we need to

605
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,100
know about what crimes are happening

606
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,720
um that's kind of um really it from from

607
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,280
my perspective

608
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,220
um as I said the name was in the title

609
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,200
was just people with far more disabled

610
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,799
security and and I suppose

611
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,860
um the intricacies of Watson fives very

612
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,960
much we are and after the fact per

613
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,480
consideration very very often because we

614
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,059
come after that has been a problem

615
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,799
um I've dealt with it all my life it's

616
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,419
fine when people see me call into the

617
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,880
door they know it's bad news but um very

618
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
often when people are are contacting us

619
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,480
something has happened at this stage

620
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,860
okay

621
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,559
um so I suppose with any crime that's

622
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,320
been reporting reported you know and

623
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,960
even at a technical level is that when

624
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,659
you come to police please have some sort

625
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:48,120
of idea what exactly has happened

626
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,740
okay

627
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,360
um and we will try and help you with the

628
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,140
Hawaii

629
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,600
and and and and obviously take it from

630
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,740
there

631
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,340
um

632
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,700
I have fortunately I have a colleague

633
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,980
Paul Johnson who's 21 years experience

634
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
and a cyber investigations and cyber

635
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,120
crime

636
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,760
um and

637
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
he's very young

638
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,900
um but and if any questions

639
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,299
um obviously not about specific cases

640
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,940
but if you have any questions in general

641
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,220
um probably Paul probably the best man

642
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,919
to ask to bring him up to the stage and

643
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,659
so we're happy to take questions and

644
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,220
just thanks very much for your time and

645
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,580
your attention

646
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,860
thanks very much um that was actually

647
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,419
really interesting because it ultimately

648
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,940
brings it down to our communities I do

649
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,400
have a question about the low levels of

650
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,580
reporting particularly for small very

651
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,919
small medium Enterprises I work out in

652
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,120
the community and do a lot of these kind

653
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,980
of talks as well

654
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,659
um what are your thoughts about how you

655
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,460
can increase

656
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,900
um the chances of people reporting

657
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,100
things like I was speaking to someone

658
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,440
and he called it an idiot tax that he

659
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,760
paid

660
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,799
um was worried about the gdpr

661
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,919
implications so said nothing

662
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,900
um but the bigger issue there is that

663
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,520
you've endangered a wider Community

664
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,620
because those customers are now more at

665
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,440
risk of fishing their data's been leaked

666
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,940
and maybe they aren't aware that that

667
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,620
was the route if you have any thoughts

668
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,820
about it you talked about something like

669
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,480
19 of people report so it's a public

670
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,700
issue for everybody any thoughts about

671
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,860
how you can encourage participation that

672
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,140
if some if it happens to a small company

673
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,179
that they do report it because they have

674
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,919
to protect their customers as well I

675
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,299
hope I've encouraged some people today

676
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:40,440
have I

677
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,520
um now look I I said my background prior

678
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,799
to the Cyber Bureau was economic crime

679
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,140
and and let's let's call a spade a spade

680
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,659
it's the reputation of the issue

681
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,240
um it's what's the name the Pringles of

682
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,400
Madagascar smile Away by smilingwave

683
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
cute and cuddly everything's just fine

684
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,080
you know so there is that element to it

685
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,880
um that you know

686
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,880
people are concerned from a reputation

687
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,860
perspective and entities are concerned

688
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,960
because you know we've been a victim of

689
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,100
ransomware I'll take my business

690
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,440
elsewhere thanks very much we've we've

691
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,419
been burgled I won't leave my I won't

692
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,720
leave my property in your premises and

693
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,760
that's that's the long and short but

694
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,760
um I suppose our message is

695
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,400
um if you don't think crime this crime

696
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,539
is going to happen to you if your head

697
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,940
in the sand but we very very much have a

698
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,799
collaborative approach with victims and

699
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,880
that's how we work we work

700
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,820
collaboratively with people and you know

701
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,700
and look the answer to it is is for us

702
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,159
to get the message out and all not just

703
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,260
the Cyber time Bureau but in general

704
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,440
which we try to do is that you know in

705
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,539
order to for the the bigger picture to

706
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,220
work we need people to come on board and

707
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,860
and engage with us um it is easier said

708
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,299
and done and I don't have the answers

709
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,100
that are going to Paul

710
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,580
I I could say ditto at that stage um

711
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,320
we what we're seeing at the moment is

712
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,600
that a lot of the more primary targets

713
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,340
now of the likes of ransomware are the

714
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,600
SME sector

715
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,720
and and that is increasing significantly

716
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
as far as that is concerned yeah as

717
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,340
Jared said at the end of the day we have

718
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,600
to work together I was at a meeting

719
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,580
there recently in The Hague and a

720
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,919
comment was made by by one of the

721
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,840
partners in law enforcement and what

722
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,940
they said is that it takes a network to

723
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,380
defeat a network

724
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,600
and at the end of the day the the Cyber

725
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
criminal Community is a network

726
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,340
and and you are part of the other

727
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,140
network along with us

728
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,840
and if we don't work together we're

729
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,100
constantly going to be coming from

730
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,620
behind and there is a reputational

731
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,080
impact potentially as far as companies

732
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,400
concerned if they put their hand up and

733
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,500
say yeah we've been hacked but if they

734
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,720
don't the colleagues and other companies

735
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,100
are going to have exactly the same

736
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,679
impact both from the ransomware itself

737
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,740
and from a damaged reputation and I

738
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,080
could be a bit facetious and say that if

739
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,659
you do report it there may be a

740
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,539
reputation a reputational positive from

741
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,520
your customers saying well they are

742
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
prepared to say yes we have a problem

743
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,419
and we're addressing it and we're doing

744
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,400
something about it but we have to work

745
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,380
together because it can't be about law

746
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,720
enforcement and corporate sector or law

747
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,760
enforcement and private sector and

748
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,919
nobody works together we'll never win

749
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,360
this battle if we do that separately

750
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,820
so I have an interest in Reservoir

751
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,559
statistics as you'll see later when I

752
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,340
speak

753
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,659
um but I'm just curious in your specific

754
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,940
context you obviously keep some details

755
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,679
about cyber crime statistics here in

756
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,419
Ireland do you share those with any

757
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,220
other law enforcement entities worldwide

758
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,440
do you speak to any academics about how

759
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,520
you could use that data in different

760
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,919
ways does it does it go anywhere outside

761
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,679
of Ireland well we have looked many of

762
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,200
our reports are on public Forums on our

763
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,659
portal there are publicly reported and

764
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,220
and then obviously we gauge with

765
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,500
Interpol and Europa and we have we have

766
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,360
Specialists you know that are answer

767
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,279
common to your Apollo interpal

768
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,740
specifically in cyber and obviously

769
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,960
Trends are analyzed we'd like that to

770
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,580
happen on a more regular basis probably

771
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,340
and have more resources doing that but

772
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,080
part of our remit is to engage with our

773
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
partners across Europe and Interpol to

774
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,940
look at look at areas and and obviously

775
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,279
you know examine look the biggest

776
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,559
challenge we face in law enforcement is

777
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,380
that we I think every speaker's hit on

778
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,679
it today is around our borders okay huge

779
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
huge challenges

780
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,299
um the problem that we have on getting

781
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,100
back to our function it's crime

782
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,039
investigation and detection so what we

783
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,320
know is one thing or we can prove on

784
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,700
evidence is a completely different

785
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,659
Factor so the answer is we we share to

786
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,940
statistics all the time when our law

787
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,620
enforcement is true you're appalling the

788
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,480
ball in various forms and Paul goes to

789
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,400
the Hague regularly as well but what I

790
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,039
would say is that um the difference with

791
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,900
the challenge we face is evidence and

792
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,640
Gathering evidence across border and

793
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
securing it and presenting it in court

794
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,620
and that's our biggest challenge so

795
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,500
this off oh there we go

796
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,299
um yeah I would just Echo that and say

797
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,400
that you know the ransomware risk is not

798
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,679
evenly distributed across the globe and

799
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,240
part of the reason we need to study this

800
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,679
and I'm asking this question is so that

801
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,480
you can see that because if you fire an

802
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,919
mlat with another country that doesn't

803
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,899
have any ransomware incidents or doesn't

804
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,640
have many then it's very hard to get

805
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,020
them motivated because they're literally

806
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,760
not dealing with the same level of risk

807
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,980
as you are here in Ireland so that's why

808
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,500
I'm trying to yeah we're the same as

809
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,880
something else we build relationships we

810
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
need to build relationships with all the

811
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,399
law enforcement agencies

812
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,260
um and that's that's part of it and you

813
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,760
know

814
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,220
particularly having been abroad you know

815
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,980
with EU different types of even vat

816
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,260
frauds online frauds

817
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,880
it's in everybody's interest to get

818
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,559
together and we obviously that's part of

819
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,820
something we wish the faster and we're

820
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,419
part of as well

821
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,740
okay okay thanks very much
