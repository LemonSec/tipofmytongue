1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,600
thank you very much

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,660
thanks to all of you for being here and

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,880
thank you for inviting me back to

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,299
ariscon it's great to be here indeed

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,220
my name is mikkom and many of you

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,980
remember me as the Finn who was working

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,859
for this company called f-secure well

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,539
f-secure split up into two different

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,300
companies this summer to Consumer side

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,960
and to business to business side I'd

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,180
like to think that the largest cyber

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,040
security company in the nordics split

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,960
into the largest and into the second

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
largest cyber security company in the

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,399
nordics that's basically what we did

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,260
and I work on the with secure side

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,239
nowadays although I also do advisory

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,940
work for f-secure so I'm still you know

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,800
doubling in all all sides of this

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,500
company for which I have indeed worked

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,800
for since 1991 and since floppy disks

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,719
were mentioned

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,340
some of you know that I always travel

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,440
with one to remind myself of where I'm

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,199
coming from so those of you in the

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,840
audience who have no idea what this is

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,420
it's the USB thumb drive of the 1990s

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,860
that's what it is and indeed

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,140
if someone would have told me in the

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,299
beginning of my career that we would end

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,400
up here where we are today I simply

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,680
would not have believed it

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,240
someone would have told me that we will

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,420
end up in a situation where we're not

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,119
fighting teenage boys riding viruses for

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,659
fun but we're fighting organized crime

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,159
ganks and we're fighting foreign

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,060
intelligence agencies and that cyber War

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,100
is not going to be a thing from science

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,020
fiction books it's going to be real it's

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,780
really going to happen all of that would

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,479
have been impossible for me to believe

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
the world has changed

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,100
throughout these years more than any of

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,600
us could have believed and it has

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
changed because of the biggest

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,759
technological Revolution ever in

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,600
Mankind's history

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,979
so yeah indeed the title of my talk is

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,560
the title of my book which is someone

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,239
called it the hooponin law I think I

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,760
said it first somewhere on some stage a

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,420
couple years ago while speaking about

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,200
these

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,640
computers

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,500
that don't look like computers because

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,680
these are computers nowadays

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,020
most of us here are computer security

59
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,200
people I'm a computer security guy I've

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
been a computer security guy all my life

61
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,360
and I used to think that that means that

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,120
my job is to secure computers I'm a

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,220
computer security guy I secure computers

64
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,900
but slowly

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,720
and surely computers have become to look

66
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,580
like this

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,040
and they've become to look like the PLC

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,739
systems and OT systems that run our

69
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,420
factories

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,660
and our cars have become data centers on

71
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,379
four wheels slowly but surely everything

72
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,140
goes online everything becomes a

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,720
computer and that means that my job has

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,140
changed our job has changed

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,420
we are no longer securing computers we

76
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,640
are securing the society

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,040
that's what we're doing

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,540
we're not thinking you're in computers

79
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,459
because computers run our society we are

80
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,260
securing the whole society and that's a

81
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,379
pretty big responsibility to be put on

82
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,080
on a bunch of Geeks and nerds we didn't

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,879
really sign up for securing the whole

84
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,500
society but that's

85
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,879
the job we have today

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,379
so I spent seven months writing the book

87
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,319
I clearly couldn't have gotten it out

88
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,360
without the pandemic so thank you

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,060
covid-19 because I was trying to work on

90
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,040
this project for a decade I wasn't going

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,620
anywhere but then when travel ended I

92
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,060
had no excuses

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,560
so my tip for writing a book is to get a

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,019
really good editor I did write this by

95
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,540
myself I didn't use no ghostwriters but

96
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,220
you really do need a professional to

97
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,319
help you to build up the structure and

98
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,200
you to give you constructive feedback I

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,939
was working with this really experienced

100
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,019
editor called Ilona and she was so nice

101
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,180
because the way we worked was that I had

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,220
a deadline every Friday for seven months

103
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,840
every Friday I submitted a factual

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,900
um chapter and then two stories or

105
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,120
anecdotes and she would read them

106
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,800
through and give me

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,680
criticism man and and when she deleted

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,199
my stuff and she deleted a lot of my

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,919
stuff

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,860
she was so nice she was like yeah I love

111
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,660
this great story

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,600
we'll put it in the next book there we

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,800
go delete it

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,620
but that's that's the way we worked and

115
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,979
that's the way we actually got it out

116
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,699
um

117
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,740
I actually originally wrote it in my my

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,600
native language of Finnish it was

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,940
translated to English and now I just

120
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,040
signed up the German translation which

121
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,320
is going to be called vasverness is

122
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,080
you gotta love the Germans don't you you

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
seem angry even when they're not

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,419
so

125
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,699
I guess the main theme and the thing I

126
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,060
keep repeating in the book is that

127
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,699
internet is the best thing

128
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,520
and the worst thing which has happened

129
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,800
during our time

130
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,500
the upsides are obvious we all know how

131
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,180
much the world has changed for the

132
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,080
better

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
and the downsides are obvious especially

134
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,460
for us who work with computer security

135
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,240
how crime has changed how risks

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,300
have changed it really is the best thing

137
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,919
and the worst thing I love the internet

138
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,199
but I know very well how much it has

139
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,660
changed our risk level

140
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,300
and in a nutshell the reason for both

141
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,940
the upside and downsides is that what

142
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,919
internet does is that it deletes

143
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,180
geography

144
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
internet deletes geography

145
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,600
online there is no distance there are no

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
distances there are no borders there is

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,160
no geography which is great

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,860
if you have a company which could be

149
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,360
anywhere on the planet but wants to go

150
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Global that was really hard to do before

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,699
the internet now people don't really

152
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,160
care where you're from you are online

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,380
you can sell anywhere especially if

154
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,660
you're selling virtual goods for example

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,880
this gaming companies coming from all

156
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
parts of the world because it really

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
doesn't matter where you are that's

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
great

159
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,780
and it's

160
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,300
it's also obvious that the risks have

161
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,039
changed when you look at how crime

162
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,620
changed from local

163
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,020
to Global

164
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,120
so my home country of Finland has five

165
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,740
million people it's not a very big

166
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,819
country

167
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,860
30 years ago

168
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,620
around 1992 every year on average we had

169
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,139
120 bank robberies

170
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,360
in my home country of Finland of 5

171
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,460
million people so twice a week someone

172
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,460
somewhere in Finland grabbed a gun and

173
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,300
walked into a bank to steal cash

174
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,520
twice a week

175
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
the last time we had a bank robbery like

176
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,000
that

177
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,599
was 12 years ago they are no longer a

178
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,580
thing we don't have bank robberies

179
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
anymore why

180
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,139
because we have no more Banks the few

181
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,460
physical Banks we have left have no cash

182
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,099
so bank robbers have done the same thing

183
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,940
we all have done we have digitalized

184
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,780
our work they've gone online

185
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,139
today's bank robbers don't drop banks

186
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,099
with guns to steal cash no they use

187
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,940
banking Trojans or they use BEC scams to

188
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,319
reroute money traffic inside

189
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,440
corporations or they use key loggers to

190
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
collect credit card numbers or they

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
break into cryptocurrency exchanges to

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,460
steal Bitcoin ethereum Monero and Zed

193
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,199
cash

194
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,240
and the difference

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
between the bank robbers of 1992 and

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,699
bank robbers of 2022 is that 30 years

197
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,520
ago the criminals were local they were

198
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,039
rubbing their own bank they woke up

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
Monday morning with a headache and no

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,280
money so they grabbed a gun and walked

201
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,520
into their own bank to steal some cash

202
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
the criminals were from the 10 mile

203
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,659
radius from the bank that they were

204
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,179
robbing and today when we look at the

205
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,000
online bank robbers they are not local

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,240
they can be and they really are anywhere

207
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
on the planet

208
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,560
geography has disappeared

209
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,820
and the mankind

210
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,240
has walked on this planet

211
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,860
a hundred thousand years I really like

212
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,779
this photo taken from the Moon that's

213
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,180
Earth that's where we all are

214
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,860
for a hundred thousand years the mankind

215
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,500
walked the planet for

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,779
whatever we did and we did did it all

217
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,980
offline we've been offline all this time

218
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,920
we went online

219
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,279
during our time and now the mankind will

220
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,640
be online forever we you and me we were

221
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,200
just we just happened to be born during

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,980
this crucial switch when we go from

223
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,399
offline world into online world so if

224
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,339
these things sometimes seem awfully

225
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,500
complex and hard to understand it's okay

226
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,080
none of this has never been done before

227
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,500
and we Our Generations we will forever

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,660
be remembered as the first people who

229
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,980
got online

230
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,980
when a future historian writes a history

231
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,760
book about the early 2000s let's say 500

232
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,220
years into the future and describes us

233
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,440
the very first thing

234
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,800
they will tell about us the very way we

235
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,480
will be remembered forever is that we

236
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,580
are the first ones to go online

237
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,440
the first people who live their lives in

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,920
the real world and in the online world

239
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,040
biggest technological Revolution

240
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,959
we've ever seen

241
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,940
if you want to compare the significance

242
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,160
of this revolution

243
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,140
the only comparison I can come up with

244
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,540
is the revolution which started 150

245
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,980
years ago

246
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,860
150 years ago most big cities got their

247
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,160
first electricity grid

248
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,019
the revolution of electricity was

249
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,019
massive

250
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,080
and today all modern societies are

251
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,200
completely reliant on electricity

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
I had a really interesting chat with a

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,800
professor last year she studies solar

254
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,079
storms and she's confident that we will

255
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,519
be facing

256
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,399
a global scale solar storm in the next

257
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,100
20 years which will likely cut off long

258
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
distance electricity connections for a

259
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,640
year or five

260
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,779
which is going to be pretty drastic

261
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,000
because we can't live without

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
electricity modern societies do not

263
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,779
function anymore without electricity

264
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,540
that's why when we do have blackouts

265
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,220
they're typically very short with build

266
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,899
systems so that we can recover very

267
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,040
quickly

268
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,140
because if electricity goes down nothing

269
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,260
works we can't communicate we can't move

270
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,959
we can't hit our buildings we can't make

271
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,120
food for our people the only people who

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,860
would carry on normally are the people

273
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,440
who can grow their own food which is

274
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,380
most which is not most of us very few of

275
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,019
us can actually do that

276
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,820
so was it a bad choice

277
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,959
150 years ago when our great

278
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,899
grandfathers embraced electricity

279
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,339
no

280
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,560
clearly they made the right choice

281
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,500
because the upsides we received from

282
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,420
electricity over the last 150 years are

283
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,700
obviously much much larger than the

284
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,800
downsides but we are now reliant on that

285
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,140
technology and my friends

286
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,060
this is exactly

287
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,540
the same decision we you and me are

288
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,019
making right now for future Generations

289
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,760
about connectivity

290
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,940
it's exactly the same thing

291
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,980
connectivity

292
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,620
isn't yet mandatory

293
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,480
but it will be

294
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,980
right now

295
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,800
if electricity goes down we would detect

296
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,899
it immediately this prom would be pitch

297
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,899
black if right now connectivity internet

298
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,480
would go down we wouldn't notice it from

299
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,300
anywhere in a couple of minutes some of

300
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,860
you would start to wonder why WhatsApp

301
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,839
isn't updating or something but I mean

302
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,120
lights would stay on

303
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
water would still be coming out of the

304
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,620
tap buses would still run on streets

305
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,800
planes would still take off certainly

306
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
you know

307
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,980
Airlines wouldn't be selling much

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,480
tickets

309
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,120
or you know you couldn't do many of the

310
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,680
things that we need connectivity for but

311
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,860
the society as a whole would carry on

312
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,019
we would still be able to make food for

313
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,519
our people today in 2022

314
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,260
but what's going to be the situation in

315
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,940
20 years

316
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,279
in 20 years

317
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
a cut in connectivity is going to be

318
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,740
almost as drastic as a cut in

319
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,839
electricity eventually it's going to be

320
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,899
exactly as drastic eventually let's make

321
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,420
a forecast eventually

322
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,220
when we have a cut in connectivity

323
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,040
that's going to cause the cut in

324
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,079
electricity as well because right now of

325
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,399
course it's the other way around when we

326
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,380
lose power we lose Internet because

327
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,060
routers don't work without electricity

328
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,120
what I'm saying is that one day

329
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,920
we will have a problem with connectivity

330
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,600
and that's going to cut electricity and

331
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,279
I know it sounds crazy but watch me when

332
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,500
it happens remember I said it

333
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,360
and if it doesn't happen never mind

334
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,639
so should we then Embrace connectivity

335
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,839
exactly in the same way as our great

336
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,459
grandfather made the right choice by

337
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,620
embracing electricity we are making the

338
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,839
right choice by embracing connectivity

339
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,120
because the upsides are much bigger than

340
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,180
the downsides but we must understand the

341
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,279
responsibility we have

342
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,940
when we are making this new technology

343
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,100
mandatory for future Generations we

344
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,899
should not take this lightly and we must

345
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,300
understand the risks it includes and we

346
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
must do our best to minimize the risks

347
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,360
but yet I do believe it is the right

348
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,000
choice to make the upsides are much

349
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,160
bigger than the downsides

350
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,920
five years ago I started speaking about

351
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,139
cyber crime unicorns

352
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,220
back then it was

353
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,060
a half joke

354
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,339
what I was talking about was a reference

355
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,980
to unicorn startup companies companies

356
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,720
value that over a billion dollars

357
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,180
typically technology startups and I

358
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,339
started wondering if one day some of

359
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,139
these organized cybercrime gangs would

360
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,420
be so powerful and so wealthy we should

361
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,720
be considering them to be unicorns well

362
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,120
five years ago that was not so obvious

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,760
today it's actually getting scarily

364
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,339
close to where they are and there's two

365
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,959
reasons

366
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
why this is happening the reason number

367
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,120
one the money made

368
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,399
by the biggest organized online crime

369
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,699
gangs has almost doubled every year for

370
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,560
the last five years

371
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,440
with attacks like blackmailing with

372
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
denial of service attacks taking down

373
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,300
online stores or BEC scams stealing

374
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,160
massive amounts of money from

375
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,320
corporations by rewriting money traffic

376
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,740
within their financial department or of

377
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,459
course

378
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,100
ransomware

379
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,899
but that doesn't explain the whole

380
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:58,680
picture

381
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,959
the other part that explains why they

382
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,940
have become so wealthy is the fact that

383
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,579
they mostly keep their wealth in

384
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,620
cryptocurrencies

385
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,180
over the last five years the amount of

386
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,220
crypto the valuation of cryptocurrencies

387
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,920
in general has increased

388
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,500
50-fold 100 fold depends on the currency

389
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,420
you're holding certainly there's lots of

390
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,459
fluctuation but overall if you had a lot

391
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,199
of Bitcoins five years ago you are

392
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,620
wealthy today and this change is the

393
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,440
kind of things the online criminals can

394
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,880
do

395
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,980
so what's the first thing they do when

396
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,120
they have a lot of money well you know

397
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,399
what it is they go and buy a Ferrari

398
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,220
or a Lambo or Audi R8 some of them like

399
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,800
to buy rolls royces this is

400
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,079
one example

401
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,360
but once they've done the obvious

402
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,699
then many of these gangs start running

403
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:51,480
their operations more professionally

404
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,940
run their own data centers hire people

405
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,220
to run it professionally

406
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,699
start to pay monthly or be monthly

407
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,740
salaries to their employees have

408
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,020
physical offices

409
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,900
hire an HR unit recruiting more hackers

410
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,020
to work for them set up fake front ends

411
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,520
for security companies so you can

412
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,040
recruit pen testers to work for you so

413
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,359
that they don't even realize that

414
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,699
they're working for the enemy

415
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,660
hire lawyers higher business analysts

416
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,400
business analysts are quite handy for

417
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,859
answerware gangs because when runs over

418
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,839
a gang steal files from the victims

419
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,059
among those files are Financial records

420
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,100
for the victim company the bookkeeping

421
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,440
records which you can give to your own

422
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
criminal business analyst who goes

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,980
through the books and then tells you

424
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,480
exactly how much money you should be

425
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,000
asking as a ransom from the victim which

426
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,820
makes the negotiations much much harder

427
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,760
oh we couldn't possibly pay you 5

428
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
million euros actually that's exactly

429
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,419
what you could pay us because we have

430
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,520
your books our analysts tells us that

431
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
that's exactly what you have in cash and

432
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,679
in short-term loans and in publicly

433
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,900
traded stocks which you could sell

434
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,419
overnight we would like to get 5 million

435
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,440
because that's what you could pay us

436
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,940
tomorrow

437
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,500
really

438
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
nasty scenario and it's gonna get worse

439
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,700
because what we haven't seen yet

440
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,260
is automation on the side of the

441
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,799
attackers

442
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,960
we started building the first machine

443
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,980
learning Frameworks for our company in

444
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,620
2005. granted back then we didn't use

445
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,240
terms like machine learning or

446
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,100
artificial intelligence we weren't

447
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,780
clever enough to figure out that's what

448
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,059
it was we spoke about automation we're

449
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,179
automating our Labs work today

450
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,640
I'll relapse like labs in all security

451
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,539
companies are highly automated

452
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,980
automatically collect new samples with

453
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,840
honey Nets and honeypots bring them into

454
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,640
our back-end systems run them in

455
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,260
different simulation and virtualization

456
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,720
systems with different settings see what

457
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
changes when you execute the samples or

458
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,919
run the exploits figure out

459
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,539
automatically based on machine learning

460
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:05,880
is this good is this bad should we

461
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,620
detect this if we should detect it

462
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,299
automatically build detection test

463
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,660
detection and deploy it back to clients

464
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,660
happens very quickly in minutes

465
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,480
this is all thanks to automation built

466
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,740
on top of machine learning or

467
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,919
major advancements in endpoint security

468
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,360
over the last 10 years have been Thanks

469
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,919
to these kind of Technologies which

470
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,340
means right now today Defenders work at

471
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,100
machine speed

472
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,559
attackers work at human speed especially

473
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,299
when you look at things like malware

474
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,600
campaigns like ransomware operations

475
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
think about it

476
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,700
the group behind a new ransomware

477
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,919
starts deploying it they decide to use

478
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,020
malicious emails which contain links to

479
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,640
websites which contain exploits which

480
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,340
drops a Windows binary on the infected

481
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,900
machines which is then the ransomware

482
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,840
sure they start spamming out the emails

483
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,240
fairly quickly they'll notice that their

484
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,280
emails are blocked and blacklisted by

485
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,799
automation built by the defender so they

486
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,419
have to change the emails change the

487
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,580
addresses rewrite this stuff then they

488
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
realize that the link gets blacklisted

489
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,940
so they need to register new domain

490
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,860
names then they realize that the actual

491
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,840
website based on content is blocked

492
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,400
automatically so they have to recreate

493
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,320
the site then they realize that the

494
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,539
binary is detected by endpoint

495
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,299
production or EDR xdr MDR what have you

496
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,280
so they have to recompile it at layers

497
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,480
of obfuscation recode it manually

498
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,360
they're doing this manually at human

499
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
speed and then when they recreate the

500
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,660
attack it's again blocked with

501
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,120
automation at machine speed this is

502
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,240
what's gonna what's gonna change they

503
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,880
will go to machine speed as well and

504
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,740
they haven't yet how do we know they

505
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,480
haven't because they're still still too

506
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,440
slow

507
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,720
their reactions are so slow we know it's

508
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,620
there done by humans

509
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,940
so why haven't they done it already

510
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,340
because there's such a lack of skill

511
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,440
it's hard to find people

512
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,660
who know how to build machine learning

513
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,100
Frameworks who would be willing to work

514
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,260
for the criminals but clearly the

515
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,960
barriers are coming down and the money

516
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,419
the attackers can invest is going up

517
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,160
it's going to happen

518
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,500
it's going to happen in the next year or

519
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,799
two and then my friends then we will see

520
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,160
that the only thing which can stop

521
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,820
a bad AI will be a good AI

522
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,799
but it's not all

523
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,860
bad news in fact I think we are living

524
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,440
the golden age for cyber security in

525
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,299
many ways

526
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,159
the technical security of our systems

527
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,960
has never been better and I know it

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,340
doesn't look like that

529
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,860
I know it looks

530
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,780
like we're going to hell in hand basket

531
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,000
but it's not the case we actually have

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,559
better technical security we've ever had

533
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,320
you look at the security systems you're

534
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,820
running you look at the operating system

535
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,679
you have on your computer compared to

536
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,299
where we were 10 years ago it is like

537
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,280
night and day creating exploits today

538
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,220
for modern operating systems is hard

539
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,080
this is why most of the attacks we see

540
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
go through humans it's the only really

541
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,179
easy route left

542
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,039
and maybe the single biggest security

543
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,039
improvement over the last 15 years is

544
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,900
this

545
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,580
and I know what you're thinking what the

546
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,380
hell

547
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,539
why is he showing us a picture of an

548
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,159
Xbox

549
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,440
well

550
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,559
you never hear about malware outbreaks

551
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,200
on Xbox do you they never get hacked do

552
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
they

553
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,720
funny isn't it because it is a computer

554
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,659
it's a computer which has a CPU

555
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,520
runs code

556
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,220
has Ram has storage it's online what's

557
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,720
the operating system inside this

558
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,880
computer it's windows because it's made

559
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,900
by Microsoft yet it's awfully secure

560
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,299
how come

561
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,340
because it's a closed environment it's a

562
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,620
computer you own which you the owner do

563
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,780
not have the right to program

564
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,360
if you have an Xbox you don't have the

565
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,940
right to write programs for it so it's a

566
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,220
closed system restricted system and this

567
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,200
is a very restrictive environment but

568
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,539
it's also a very secure environment

569
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,960
so why am I speaking about Xboxes

570
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,380
because this is an Xbox

571
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
the phones and the tablets we use have

572
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,419
exactly the same security architecture

573
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,659
as a games console the iPad I have right

574
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,940
here I could do anything I could do with

575
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,539
my MacBook on this thing it's a very

576
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,940
powerful computer the only difference to

577
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,740
my MacBook is that I can't write code

578
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,059
for this one

579
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,700
I'm not allowed to write code and run

580
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,140
code on this one the only way I could

581
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,480
run code on my my own iPad is to write

582
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,100
code and send it to California to be

583
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,100
approved by Apple then I could run the

584
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,200
code on my own device which is a very

585
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,419
very restrictive model

586
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,880
but also very safe model

587
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,799
and maybe one of the things we should be

588
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,240
doing more

589
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,120
is to take away the possibilities for

590
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
end users to shoot themselves into foot

591
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,200
by not giving them full-blown computers

592
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,179
by giving them more restrictive things

593
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,679
including Chromebooks which are I've

594
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,840
actually worked on two cases where

595
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,000
companies recovered from ransomware

596
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,220
cases and when they recovered

597
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,320
they deployed Chromebooks to most of

598
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,980
their employees

599
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,000
certainly not everybody can do their

600
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,679
work with a Chromebook but actually very

601
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,320
big part of our employees could all they

602
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,240
need really is a browser

603
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,520
kind of hard to hack a system when there

604
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,799
is no

605
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,659
exes you could run on these systems

606
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,340
arbitrary code

607
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,960
and I know what some of you are thinking

608
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,419
why is he praising the security of these

609
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,919
devices when we've all read the

610
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,500
headlines about how Pegasus in fact

611
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,220
iPhones of parliament members and

612
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,140
diplomats and the prime minister of

613
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,280
Spain

614
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,740
well my friends this is not a security

615
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,919
failure this is a success story

616
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,299
this right here is a success story why

617
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,500
because it costs 100 000 Euros

618
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,860
to hack an iPhone with Pegasus

619
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,039
one hundred thousand Euros which means

620
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,580
not everybody can be targeted Jeff Bezos

621
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,740
can be targeted and he has been targeted

622
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,360
with Pegasus

623
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,400
prime minister of Spain can be targeted

624
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,039
most of us maybe all of us none of us

625
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,500
will be targeted by this

626
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,299
because we're not worth hundred thousand

627
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,520
Euros this is an example of just how

628
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,700
hard it is to break through the barriers

629
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,039
we can build into closed environments it

630
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,580
is not a failure it is a success

631
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,340
because obviously we cannot create

632
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,539
completely unhackable systems we can

633
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,860
just raise the barriers and if the

634
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,020
barriers are 100 000 Euros High pretty

635
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,679
good barriers

636
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,020
so the only ones left who can do attacks

637
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,039
like these are governments

638
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,659
and during this year

639
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,940
this unusual year we've seen

640
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,100
plenty of examples of what governments

641
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,679
are willing to do with offensive cyber

642
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,159
attacks

643
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,320
when I hop on a car in my home and drive

644
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,940
to the nearest highway there's a road

645
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,140
sign

646
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,940
not too far away from my home in

647
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,539
Helsinki which says Saint Petersburg 270

648
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,299
kilometers I live

649
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,039
not next door but close by

650
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,600
to Russia both my grandfathers fought

651
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,279
the Russians in the second world war

652
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,740
we've always had

653
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,840
a very big and very unpredictable

654
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,760
neighbor

655
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,480
and when tanks crossed the borders from

656
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,520
Russia to Ukraine on the 24th of

657
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,419
February in many ways the world changed

658
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,740
we right now have a war in Europe in the

659
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,299
very center of Europe

660
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:09,480
and it's been full of the prices

661
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,400
in the beginning we saw plenty of

662
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,320
activity which we attributed back to the

663
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,840
Russian government but the last major

664
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,120
attack like that we saw in the end of

665
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,440
April

666
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,419
that was the in Destroyer too with which

667
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,460
they tried cutting power again in

668
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,740
Ukraine and failed this time since then

669
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,260
we've seen plenty of attacks which are

670
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,240
linked to the crisis but which or to do

671
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,980
the war but which are not done by the

672
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,900
government but are done by patriotic

673
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,840
hackers groups like killnet or no name

674
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,919
57 or hacksnet or done by cyber crime

675
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,200
gangs aligning themselves from their

676
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,520
interests with

677
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,039
their Homeland Russia but these are not

678
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,120
part of the government

679
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,100
now this is quite surprising we don't

680
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,860
really know why my best theory on why

681
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,720
Russian government hasn't been using

682
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,779
more cyberpower during the war since

683
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,720
April is that right now the war is being

684
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,380
run by old schools generals who believe

685
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,320
that the role of cyber belongs to the

686
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
beginning of the war to soften the the

687
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,100
enemy before real war starts but then

688
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,500
when missiles start flying and bombs

689
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,620
start dropping cyber takes the back seat

690
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,360
that's maybe what they're thinking right

691
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,279
now and of course that's not the way it

692
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,860
would have to be but maybe that is the

693
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,120
explanation

694
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,799
it is a bit of a mystery

695
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
so we are living in the middle

696
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
of the biggest

697
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,700
technological revolution in Mankind's

698
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
history

699
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,820
hard for us to see just how big the

700
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,220
revolution is because we are living

701
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,340
dead center in the middle of it but we

702
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,820
will be remembered forever

703
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,799
as the first generation in Mankind's

704
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,779
history which went online and the

705
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,880
internet truly is the best thing and the

706
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,900
worst thing which has happened during

707
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,279
our time

708
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,450
thank you very much

709
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:17,400
[Applause]

710
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,660
we have a synonym

711
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,000
[Laughter]

712
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,940
all right shall we take some questions

713
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,020
all right

714
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,640
one or two questions from the audience

715
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,799
anybody and to make it more exciting the

716
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,480
first question we'll get a copy of my

717
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,279
book

718
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,559
right there

719
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,960
all right you're not going to get a copy

720
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,240
of the book I will give you a signed

721
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,919
punch card so you can use it as a

722
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,059
bookmark in your book because that's

723
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,039
what I do

724
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,220
yeah I so you mentioned the the cost

725
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,720
barrier the hundred thousand to use

726
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,460
Pegasus when do you see the

727
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,740
commodization of that kind of software

728
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,760
right yep certainly the tricks used in

729
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,740
the Pegasus we've seen the exploits and

730
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,539
the exploit chains we've seen used in

731
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,480
Pegasus developed by NSO in Israel

732
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,580
they've been changing all the time

733
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,580
because Apple keeps closing the holes so

734
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,500
the the window of opportunity of course

735
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,039
is there but if you consistently are

736
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,919
able to create exploit chains

737
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,559
which are able to exploit systems which

738
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,720
are so hard to exploit that an iPhone

739
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,120
right now is the value for that will

740
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,399
remain high Apple has proven that

741
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,020
they're able to fix these very quickly

742
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,020
and apple or in particular iOS and iPad

743
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,260
OS has remarkably quick update rate when

744
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,059
you look at statistics how quickly

745
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,039
people update to the latest version of

746
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,200
Android it takes years how quickly

747
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
people update the latest version of iOS

748
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,220
and iPad OS it takes a week or two which

749
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,159
is surprising so sure it does bring

750
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,580
opportunities for criminals like pickups

751
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,580
is used by governments but the window of

752
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,740
opportunity is still fairly small it is

753
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,779
still in my book a success story it's

754
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,880
probably the best example we have of

755
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,340
security created by closed systems

756
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,199
and I'll get you a punch card after this

757
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,260
um you mentioned that it's inevitable

758
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,820
that we're going to have a society based

759
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,140
on connectedness

760
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,059
is it inevitable that that's going to be

761
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,159
a centralized surveillance based

762
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,140
connected economy or is there a

763
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,940
possibility of

764
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,500
having a society that's more like the

765
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,200
original intent of the internet

766
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,419
decentralized and heterogeneous

767
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:32,039
well right now it doesn't look very good

768
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,679
does it unfortunately many of the big

769
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,240
Innovations

770
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,960
um

771
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,419
didn't turn out to create the kind of

772
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,179
society we we were wishing for email is

773
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:44,700
a prime example we all used to run our

774
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,740
own websites we all used to run our own

775
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,380
email servers today

776
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,059
pretty much nobody runs their own

777
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,860
personal website anymore and companies

778
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,419
don't run their own email servers

779
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,460
anymore and of course social media is as

780
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,880
centralized as it possibly could

781
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,140
um

782
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,179
there seems to be the attitude of Winner

783
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,679
Takes it all because there's so much

784
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,779
money to be made

785
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,940
when the web came around

786
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,860
I set up the first website for our

787
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,380
company in April 1994. there was like 15

788
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,080
websites in our country at the time

789
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,899
and when we saw visitors coming in and

790
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,659
browsing content or on our website you

791
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,700
know it clicked you know this is this

792
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,679
works people come here and this is easy

793
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,260
to use like a web with images and links

794
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,399
and you can click on it anybody could

795
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,840
use this this is going to grow it's

796
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,520
gonna be a success story

797
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,260
but then we were chatting about it in

798
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,880
the lab like okay if if this is gonna

799
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,500
grow and if you're going to have lots of

800
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,659
websites and lots of content and maybe

801
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:43,080
news or weather reports even movies

802
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,260
online one day how are we gonna pay for

803
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,419
it because clearly newspapers are not

804
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:49,860
going to bring their stories online for

805
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,059
free there's going to be a payment

806
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:54,000
mechanism and the way we've figured it's

807
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,659
gonna work in 1994 is that browsers will

808
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,899
have a payment button I want to read

809
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,080
this news article click and I pay five

810
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,679
cents two cents half a cent to read the

811
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,520
article

812
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,919
that was 1994.

813
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,260
25 years later we still don't have the

814
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,360
button in our browser

815
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,580
instead we came up with this completely

816
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,080
different way of paying for Content

817
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,720
which is profiling the users and selling

818
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,019
access to advertisers to Target us

819
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,840
through that kind of profiling which I

820
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,340
clearly didn't see coming and it's a

821
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,200
prime example of the very you have we

822
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
are going towards more centralized than

823
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,659
towards a society which doesn't preserve

824
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,059
or respect our privacy

825
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,159
and for that you get a copy of my book

826
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,080
find me after that thank you very much

827
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,980
thank you
