00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,620
foreign

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,180
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,400
firstly can you hear me okay

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
perfect so the purpose of this threat

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,840
briefing here today is to give you a

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,940
high level strategic overview of the

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,500
threats that we as a company are seeing

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
over the past 12 to 18 months

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,820
specifically in regards to the e-crime

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,760
ecosystem so financially motivated cyber

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,220
criminals and we use the word ecosystem

12
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,160
very deliberately so whereas in the past

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,380
one group would have conducted an

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,020
operation from start to finish that is

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,700
now rarely the case and we're just

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,280
seeing a greater diversification and the

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,140
increase in the number of groups but

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,000
also the specializations that they

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,579
conduct as well so we'll go a little bit

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,500
more into detail about all the various

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,079
actors and the plethora of services that

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,719
they're offering

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,000
no need for introductions as you give me

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
a very warm welcome there

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,920
so just to touch upon the agenda first

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,840
so we're going to look initially at the

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,899
adversarial threat so why we as a

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,119
company Focus uh very heavily on the

29
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,700
adversary and then we'll look into the

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,580
eco e-crime ecosystem itself so what are

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,439
the major trends that we've seen over

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,619
the past 12 months and then we'll dive

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,900
into the uh

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,020
access operations how the actors gain

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,880
initial access into a victim's

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
environment and then pushed exploitation

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,460
how they're moving laterally to find the

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,780
information that they then want to

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,479
exfiltrate and then finally how are they

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,119
then monetizing that information

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,200
foreign

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,619
so firstly the adversarial threat so the

43
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,720
key for is we as a company like to say

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
to our clients is you don't have a

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,500
malware problem you have an adversary

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,840
problem and fundamentally we as a

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,860
company believe that uh over time uh

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,740
Trends and techniques can shift but

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,299
fundamentally understanding the

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,860
adversary and understanding their

51
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,280
motivations is key to protecting your

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,740
environments

53
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,560
so we do use the term crowdstrike we are

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,020
an adversarial focused cyber security

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,560
firm so whilst malware and whilst

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
techniques can shift over time

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,959
infrastructure can shift over time

58
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,700
fundamentally there is an individual or

59
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,099
a group of individuals out there with a

60
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,260
distinct set of motivations to Target an

61
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,959
organization to Target a sector or even

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,599
a particular geography as well so

63
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,480
linking events to an adversary and

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,099
understanding how they're shifting their

65
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,379
tactics over time is often the key to

66
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,660
staying ahead in modern cyber defense

67
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,920
foreign

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,140
so at crowdstrike we categorize the

69
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,540
adversary into three major buckets so

70
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,300
firstly nation state adversaries and

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,519
this typically revolves around law

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
enforcement military and intelligence

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,739
services but fundamentally they are

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,540
acting at the behest of their own

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
national government

76
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,500
then e-crime adversaries so these are

77
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,540
financially motivated cyber criminals

78
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,640
and their motivation is nothing more

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,420
than pure profit and then finally

80
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,040
hacktivists so these are adversaries who

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,560
will compromise Network to essentially

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,620
further a social or a political aim

83
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,840
there so this is our adversary Universe

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,940
this is a list of all the known

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,159
adversaries that we are tracking that

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,680
have been active and attempting to

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,840
compromise our clients environments over

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,080
the past 12 months so this is not an

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,299
exhaustive list of the adversaries that

90
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,920
we track but these are the ones that

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,959
have been the most active over the past

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,540
12 months and this is just the tip of

93
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
the iceberg so just to go into a little

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,980
bit about how we attribute events to

95
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,440
known actors so we have a number of

96
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,659
major collection points the major one

97
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,239
being endpoint Telemetry so we have

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,940
access to over 40 million endpoints and

99
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,040
that's generating over a trillion events

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,560
a day which is an unmanageable number

101
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,959
for any human or team of humans to

102
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,180
interpret so we use a number of various

103
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,580
techniques including machine learning to

104
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,639
initially identify clusters of activity

105
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,399
so discernible malware campaigns

106
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,019
discernible targetings or particular

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,560
organizations and particular sectors but

108
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,540
then finally the final piece is the

109
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,340
attribution and this is often the most

110
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,280
difficult part and fundamentally this is

111
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,699
a dynamic situation as well so only and

112
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,199
once we have enough evidence to

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,780
attribute that activity cluster to a

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,360
known adversary we will do so and

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,979
potentially this can take weeks to

116
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,680
months and the activity cluster May

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
remain as an activity cluster and then

118
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,759
evidence comes later on down the line

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,160
but then allows us to attribute that to

120
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,900
a known adversary

121
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,759
on the flip side as well if this is

122
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,380
something new and unique that we've

123
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,600
never seen before potentially that can

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,300
then be graduated to become a new known

125
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,840
adversary

126
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,340
so this slide here relates to our

127
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,800
overall Telemetry that we're seeing at

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,860
crowdstrike and we're using 2019 as a

129
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,139
baseline there in terms of the overall

130
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,180
Telemetry we are roughly seeing an

131
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,180
increase Sevenfold over that time period

132
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,520
so if you look at the red line there in

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,580
regards to nation state activity more or

134
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,860
less that's remained fairly consistent

135
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,199
up until the last quarter of last year

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,060
and the beginning of this year for

137
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,340
obvious reasons but that line is again

138
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,639
beginning to flatten out and in a way

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,500
this makes sense because a lot of

140
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,199
national governments militaries they

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,660
only have so many people so much funding

142
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,240
so much expertise so unless they throw

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,300
more money at those operations these

144
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,039
numbers are unlikely to rise

145
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,740
significantly over the coming years so

146
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,240
we don't anticipate that Rising

147
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,820
significantly however a lot of the

148
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,580
increase is due to the diversification

149
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,820
of this e-crime ecosystem so whether

150
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,699
this is an increase in Access brokers

151
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,160
who are selling access into victims

152
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,680
environments whether it's malware as a

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
service operators ransomware as a

154
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,759
service operators we've just seen that

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,979
ecosystem grow and the number of

156
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,680
characters within it grow as well so

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,500
again that is fueling that rise and then

158
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,180
as we mentioned earlier in terms of

159
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,400
unattributed those will be the activity

160
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,380
clusters that we've initially identified

161
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,259
and again that's a dynamic situation and

162
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,539
then once we get more evidence that will

163
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,259
be linked to a non-adversary

164
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,259
so next we want to look at the the more

165
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,819
common trends that we're observing over

166
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,220
the past 12 months in this ecosystem

167
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,479
so some of the overarching trends so the

168
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,800
first one here we're going to look at is

169
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
novel extortion without the use of

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,960
ransomware so this is actors collecting

171
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,759
information on the deep and dark web

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,819
looking for credentials and data that's

173
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,460
already out there going to organizations

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,860
and run something that for a profit as

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,840
well so that's without the use of

176
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,740
malware

177
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,380
living off the land techniques so once

178
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,020
these uh actors are in a victim's

179
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,240
organization we're seeing an increase in

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,580
living off the land techniques so the

181
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,860
use the the use of legitimate tools and

182
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,560
processes to remain undetected within

183
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,780
that environment and to not trigger any

184
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,860
alerts

185
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,660
ransomware as a service will come back

186
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,560
to

187
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,780
greater criminal collaboration so again

188
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,300
we have a number of active underground

189
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,240
forums and marketplaces where we're

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,240
seeing cyber criminals interact at a

191
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
greater rate and also the likes of

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,500
ransomware as a service dedicated leaked

193
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,080
sites where various Affiliates are

194
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,960
communicating with the larger more

195
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,060
technical groups in order to conduct

196
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,039
certain parts of the operation as well

197
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,900
so again this greater level of

198
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,259
communication is fueling that rise

199
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,360
access Brokers as well offering access

200
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,460
into a victim's environment and we'll

201
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,460
come back to that in a minute

202
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,560
so in terms of run somewhere run

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,660
somewhere as a service we are seeing an

204
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,580
increase in ransomware related data

205
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,819
leaks so for 2021 we saw an 82 percent

206
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,419
increase over the previous year and 2021

207
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,099
was actually an interesting year for

208
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,780
ransomware and run somewhere as a

209
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
service operators so during the middle

210
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,160
of the year we saw high profile events

211
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,379
such as the colonial Pipeline and the

212
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,799
JBS food events which brought a lot of

213
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,020
political and media attention and then

214
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,080
after that law enforcement activity as

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,958
well so we saw a number of groups scale

216
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,240
back their activities and we saw some

217
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,519
groups disband entirely so this

218
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,920
effectively created a vacuum and we saw

219
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,440
new groups emerge so now we're at the

220
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
point where the number of ransomware as

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,080
a service groups overall has increased

222
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,660
so just the demonstration of the sector

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,580
by sector in terms of the numbers that

224
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,740
we're seeing there top four being

225
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,140
industrial engineering manufacturing

226
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,899
technology uh

227
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,600
Professional Services as well so all

228
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,220
Industries holding high value

229
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,800
proprietary information whether that's

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,880
information in regards to new research

231
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,800
manufacturing processes and so on so

232
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
information that firms are willing to

233
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,180
pay for and willing to pay big money for

234
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,240
as well so high level information

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,620
foreign

236
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,779
next we're looking at the number of

237
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,820
services that are offered on the deep

238
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440
and dark web and how this is

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
facilitating a rise in that activity as

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,420
well so we try and break that down into

241
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,120
three buckets so service distribution

242
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
monetization

243
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,100
so Services that's the actual

244
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,620
facilitation of criminal operations as

245
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,360
well that's going to be the likes of

246
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,100
your ransomware as a service operations

247
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,880
that'll be the access Brokers as well on

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,500
the distribution side the distribution

249
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,580
of malware spam campaigns fishing kits

250
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,500
and so on and then finally the

251
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,720
monetization so after a successful

252
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,360
operation has taken place out of the

253
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
actors then actualize those gains

254
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
typically in the form of cryptocurrency

255
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
Into Cash

256
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
so we're going to look at access

257
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
operations so higher adversaries gaining

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,580
access initially into those victim

259
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,300
environments

260
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
so we're going to talk about access

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,700
Brokers we've seen a rise in the number

262
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,220
of access broker groups specifically

263
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,100
dedicated access broker groups who will

264
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,279
conduct reconnaissance on specific

265
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,260
organizations who will conduct spear

266
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,600
phishing campaigns who will search for

267
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,459
leaked credentials that are already on

268
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,100
the deep and dark web package those up

269
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,959
they will then look to use the likes of

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,899
brute forcing techniques credential

271
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,120
stuffing attacks to gain initial access

272
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,760
into a victim's environment but they

273
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
have no intention of going any further

274
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,839
they will then sell that access on to

275
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,579
some of the more technically Adept

276
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,560
groups as well and there are various

277
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,420
forums and marketplaces where they will

278
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,779
sell this access as well additionally we

279
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,740
do see cyber crime actors that gain ad

280
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,899
hoc access into an environment they

281
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,360
happen upon that access and effectively

282
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,339
they want to monetize that they may not

283
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,140
be technically Adept enough to conduct

284
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,240
an operation but they know they can make

285
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,500
some money at that stage

286
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,240
so this Horizon access Brokers is

287
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,180
effectively

288
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,700
changing techniques for a lot of these

289
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,500
actors who previously where we would

290
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,079
have seen a lot of actors use malware

291
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,779
heavy intrusion methods the use of

292
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,060
custom malware as well to gain entry

293
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,820
into those environments we're now at the

294
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,860
point where the majority of the initial

295
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,839
access vectors that we're seeing are now

296
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,660
fireless

297
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,120
so just to give you the numbers on that

298
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
so these statistics here relates

299
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
specifically to 2021 so 62 percent

300
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,540
malware free versus 38 uh use of malware

301
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,459
and we're seeing the stats for this year

302
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,399
that's getting closer to the 70 Mark as

303
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,019
well

304
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,339
foreign

305
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,320
so this is one of the adversaries that

306
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,940
we track and I just want to highlight

307
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,980
here this is one of the adversaries that

308
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,019
has been Adept in changing their

309
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,140
techniques over time to adapt to the

310
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,180
ecosystem at the moment and to

311
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,760
essentially follow the money so carbon

312
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,600
spider active since 2013

313
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
initially

314
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,839
uniquely just targeted the financial

315
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,399
sector in Russia from about 2013 to 2015

316
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,399
but there was a change of tact around

317
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,940
2015 and the group actually split so we

318
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,920
saw carbon spider split into another

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,220
group called Cobalt spider as well

320
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,800
Cobalt spider fundamentally remained

321
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,300
targeting the Russian financial sector

322
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,940
whereas carbon spider moved to targeting

323
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,639
more e-commerce firms at a global level

324
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
as well card information and so on so

325
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,040
from around that 2015 Mark to

326
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,620
approximately 2019 that was their Prime

327
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,940
their primary targeting profile but from

328
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,800
that point onwards they got into the

329
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,019
ransomware as a service game and big

330
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:27,899
game hunting ransomware as well so

331
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,420
initially using rival ransomware but

332
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,220
then developing their own dark side

333
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,440
ransomware as well and this is the group

334
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
famous for compromising the colonial

335
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,980
pipeline as well

336
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,440
so post exploitation so once these

337
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,180
actors are in the environment what

338
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,620
techniques are they using

339
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,240
so living off the land techniques so

340
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
again we're just seeing a greater

341
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,980
proliferation of legitimate tools

342
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,459
legitimate services to essentially

343
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,079
remain undetected with the in the

344
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,060
environment to not demonstrate any

345
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,579
anomalous activity and to not trigger

346
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,880
any internal alerts as well as an

347
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
example our threat hunting team

348
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
OverWatch

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,579
one out of every 10 intrusions that they

350
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,040
see over the course of 2022 they're

351
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,899
seeing the use of mimikats as well so

352
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,160
this is just an example of how they're

353
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,560
using legitimate tools to move to the

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,940
areas of the network where they can

355
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,279
effectively look at the information they

356
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,480
want to exfiltrate

357
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,519
remote desktop protocols as well so

358
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,000
again over over the covered period we're

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,279
seeing a greater level of targeting on

360
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,699
those RDP environments any desk being

361
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,920
the primary one that we're seeing as

362
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,099
well

363
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,500
so what do the adversaries want

364
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,760
fundamentally they want your data but

365
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,860
moreover they want to monetize that as

366
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,040
well

367
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,420
so in terms of the major ransomware

368
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,160
variants that we're seeing over the

369
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,560
course of this year statistics here lock

370
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,180
bit is by far and away the most

371
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,959
prevalent but a lot of this number a lot

372
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,300
of these numbers come from the past two

373
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,639
or three months so the release of lock

374
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,699
bit 3.0 the newest variant in June of

375
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,000
this year we've seen a massive uptick in

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,980
lock bit operations and a lot of these

377
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,380
numbers relate specifically to that time

378
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,339
period

379
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,899
if you came to the first quarter this

380
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,019
year Conti was by far and away the

381
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,279
largest threat that we were seeing in

382
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
the first quarter of this year but Conti

383
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,199
had a bit of an issue when effectively

384
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,019
Ukrainian security researchers in the

385
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,220
first half of the Year leaked

386
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,440
information in regards to the group's

387
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,620
activities structure and even done to

388
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,260
their chat logs as well so this had a

389
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,300
major impact on their operations and

390
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,639
we've seen those numbers tail off for

391
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,420
the end of this year

392
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,459
again pervasive run somewhere in the

393
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,260
sectors they're targeting so again going

394
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,500
back to those high-level research

395
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,839
proprietary information so you're seeing

396
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
the likes of the industrial sector

397
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,920
manufacturing sector and Professional

398
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,360
Services as well

399
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,519
so again one of the more active or the

400
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,079
most active adversary that we're

401
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,779
tracking in the e-crime space as well so

402
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,300
bit why spider famous for the

403
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,220
development of lockbit and the steel bit

404
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,880
info Steeler as well uh now with the

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,980
development of lockbit 3.0 they're

406
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,040
picking up pace in terms of the numbers

407
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,480
of operations that they're conducting

408
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,339
and the number of victims we are seeing

409
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,259
are rising as a result so in terms of

410
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,120
the numbers three to four victim

411
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,540
organizations a day 35 sectors over 74

412
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,000
countries as well and quite a novel

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,339
business model they use as well so we're

414
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,440
now seeing on the dedicated leak site

415
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,959
for lockbit 3.0 we are seeing the use of

416
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,740
a VIP service where effectively they get

417
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,899
a higher level of interaction with the

418
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,120
group and typically these are trusted

419
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,920
Affiliates that they've worked with in

420
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,899
the past and conducted successful

421
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,480
operations with as well so again they're

422
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,640
controlling access to the service very

423
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
tightly and they know who they can work

424
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,240
with and they know who they they can

425
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,480
trust

426
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,240
so bringing all the elements together

427
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,699
that we've talked about here so what

428
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,799
would a modern attack sequence look like

429
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,260
how are these actors working together in

430
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,660
order to facilitate a successful

431
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,380
operation so initially access access is

432
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,260
going to typically be uh gained via the

433
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,780
use of access Brokers they're taking the

434
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,940
time to conduct the research the

435
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,460
reconnaissance the phishing campaigns

436
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,160
getting all that information together

437
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,320
using various techniques to enter the

438
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,299
environment and then at that point they

439
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,980
have no intention of going any further

440
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,919
they will sell that access on to further

441
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,740
cyber criminal groups

442
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,780
we will then see likely see the

443
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,440
deployment of malware banking Trojans in

444
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,740
an attempt to gain backdoor access

445
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,360
we're going to see lateral movement

446
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,760
typically now more with living off the

447
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,039
land techniques using those legitimate

448
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,679
tools and processes to then move within

449
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,039
the network undetected

450
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,620
locating the information of high value

451
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,320
and exfiltrating that external to the

452
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,640
victim environment

453
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,100
and then finally the use of ransomware

454
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,740
itself to lock up various machines and

455
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,919
to then effectively extort the victim on

456
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,980
their dedicated leak site so they're

457
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,480
effectively trying to pressure the board

458
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
members pressure the cyber security

459
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,520
teams via the use of ransomware locking

460
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,620
up those machines the leaking of

461
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,240
information on these dedicated leak

462
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,360
sites in a a Drip by drip fashion as

463
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,100
well to put the pressure on these

464
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,000
organizations it's simple effective and

465
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,799
it is working

466
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,960
and then finally the actual monetization

467
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,620
phase so using various forms of crypto

468
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,960
mixing services and the like to actually

469
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,419
convert that cryptocurrency into Cash

470
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,700
so that brings me more or less to the

471
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,740
end of the briefing and it will leave

472
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,059
you with one of the phrases that we use

473
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,700
with our clients as well so your ability

474
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,280
to defeat any advanced cyber threat

475
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
depends entirely on your understanding

476
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,960
of the problem so understanding the

477
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,539
threat specific to your organization to

478
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,360
your sector who are the adversaries who

479
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,539
have been targeting that sector why are

480
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,220
they doing it what are what are their

481
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,260
motivations and how have they changed

482
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,940
their tactics over the past six months

483
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,299
to 12 6 to 12 months so understanding

484
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,220
that understanding that change will

485
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,559
allow you to configure your defensive

486
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,140
posture and to stay ahead in terms of

487
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,580
cyber defense

488
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,679
so I think at this point we can field

489
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,280
any questions

490
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,050
[Music]

491
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,400
firstly uh congratulations I think

492
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,559
crowdstrike are doing an awesome job of

493
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,200
protecting their customers thank you a

494
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,840
very impressive statistics recently

495
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,760
um I was looking at

496
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,460
um the recent one with the Mirai

497
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,240
bothness which is iot

498
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
um and what you defended against fairly

499
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,660
recently that was really impressive how

500
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,700
crowdstrike managed to to because

501
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,140
gigantic traffic

502
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,460
yes

503
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,179
so what what do you see is as you know

504
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,980
the future of that is that just going to

505
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,700
keep increasing or how

506
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,380
in terms of the numbers that we're

507
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,720
seeing overall the numbers do seem to be

508
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
increasing overall and that's not just

509
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,160
in the e-crime sector the Telemetry

510
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,220
overall is growing now you can say we as

511
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,840
a company are growing we're seeing more

512
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,120
endpoints at a global level but

513
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,440
fundamentally when you're talking about

514
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,780
events in the trillions

515
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,539
our growth as a company does not explain

516
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,600
that we're just seeing again a greater

517
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,120
rise overall conversely we are seeing

518
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,940
better cyber defenses we are seeing at

519
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,799
board levels in the private sector as

520
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,360
well we're seeing greater understanding

521
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,240
of a more holistic approach to cyber

522
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,360
security so not just plug and play tools

523
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
but understanding the threat at a wider

524
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,520
level as well so whilst whilst the

525
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
numbers are growing we are seeing a

526
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
better understanding on the defensive

527
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,120
side as well so

528
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,400
it could go either way but effectively

529
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
on the e-crime side definitely those

530
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,830
numbers are going to continue to rise

531
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,960
[Music]

532
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,480
um I'm hearing a lot about the triple

533
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,539
trash uh that's now occurring whereby

534
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,659
company data has been leaked the systems

535
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,460
are being locked out but also they're

536
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,159
being hit with the DDOS attack in order

537
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,320
to push more intense pressure on

538
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,679
companies and various institutions to

539
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,900
pay up and pay up quicker yes are you

540
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,020
seeing much of that and second part of

541
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,640
the question are you seeing it being

542
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,340
effective for those employing it

543
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,900
so

544
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,299
once we do see Triple extortion as well

545
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,640
it is in the rise but it's still a small

546
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,960
proportion of what we're seeing on that

547
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,240
kind of ransomware and putting pressure

548
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
on the board side of things as well is

549
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,640
it an effective technique yes it is but

550
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,559
again this goes back to each individual

551
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,780
firm some firms are in a position to

552
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,760
weather that storm better than others as

553
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
well so weather comes down to do you pay

554
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,860
the rents in that situation we would

555
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,720
never advise either way because this is

556
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,059
a company by company decision but

557
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,980
effectively at that level you've got to

558
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,020
be able to justify

559
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,140
do we pay this ransomware how is this

560
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,460
going to affect our company and we've

561
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
seen companies go bankrupt as a result

562
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,260
of some of these uh attacks as well so

563
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,120
fundamentally at that level you've got

564
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,460
to be able to justify either way whether

565
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,799
you pay or you don't pay as well and

566
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,380
that these actors know that they know

567
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,419
this is going on behind the scenes and

568
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,299
putting more and more pressure is we are

569
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,760
seeing that on the increase as well so

570
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,500
it's um

571
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,440
that actual specific technique of triple

572
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
extortion it's on the increase but it's

573
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,720
still a small proportion of what we see

574
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,020
foreign

575
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,480
trend is that they're using this

576
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,419
platform to actually illustrate like

577
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,940
darkness and selling things online a

578
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,480
list of activity Z crime it's a huge uh

579
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,740
increase on this in the last two years

580
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,200
amount due to covet and all this like

581
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,240
have you noticed to yourself

582
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,480
that's specific Forum I'm not too

583
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,039
familiar but I can speak in general

584
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,659
about the threat so in terms of the

585
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,159
actual numbers of forums and

586
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,919
marketplaces that we're seeing they are

587
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,080
growing some are more

588
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,000
they've gained a reputation more than

589
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,340
others as well some of these forums it

590
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,960
is literally recycling of information

591
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,059
that's already out there on the deep and

592
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,760
dark web as well when it comes to the

593
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,640
sale of malware for example or even

594
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
linking up with ransomware as a service

595
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,880
groups those are typically more

596
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,520
controlled by those adversaries and

597
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,799
they're they're very particular in who

598
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,320
they work with as well so it's almost

599
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,780
hackers coming in at the at the bottom

600
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,760
level almost have to prove themselves to

601
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,020
these groups before they'll actually

602
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,900
work with them and essentially they they

603
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,280
want to make sure it's not law

604
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,740
enforcement as well so at the higher

605
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,539
level definitely there's almost that

606
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,720
element of okay what have you got prove

607
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
yourself what kind of information can

608
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,860
you bring to the table and how can you

609
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,140
conduct operations as well so we are

610
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,600
seeing more of that as well and then the

611
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
communication channels within these

612
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,400
forums as well is it is increasing there

613
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,960
is a lot of white noise as well but

614
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,340
actually getting down to the Crux of

615
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,799
finding

616
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,240
concrete targeting as well that can be

617
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,580
quite difficult so again we use a number

618
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,080
of techniques on that side whether it's

619
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,760
digital risk monitoring to look for

620
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,220
specific information in regards to

621
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,020
specific groups as well because

622
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,360
fundamentally there is so much white

623
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,980
noise and so much information out there

624
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,440
so you have to be very specific in what

625
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,480
you're looking for but those

626
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,030
communication channels are growing

627
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,640
[Music]

628
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,220
one of the slides you mentioned yes 70

629
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,860
percent

630
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,120
non-malware or malware free I think was

631
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,640
the caption yes is and that's a rising

632
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,960
Trend that you've seen over a couple of

633
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,279
years any recommendation uh that goes

634
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,600
with it on

635
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,940
more appropriate Telemetry to be looking

636
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,700
at to deal with that kind of situation

637
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,440
so when it comes to the malware free

638
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,020
side of things it has been growing but

639
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,179
this is a fairly recent Trend and

640
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,179
possibly over the past two years and

641
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,580
this ryzen access Brokers has been

642
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,919
fairly new over the past two years it's

643
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,080
been growing within we've seen a curve

644
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,600
like that

645
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
fundamentally what we often recommend to

646
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,279
our clients is having visibility on leak

647
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,840
credentials that are already out there

648
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,600
on the deep and dark web using some form

649
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,940
of rules monitoring to search for your

650
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,980
information and having that visibility

651
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,539
and knowing what's already out there

652
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,659
what's leaked and then remediating that

653
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,120
as well so having that visibility goes a

654
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,460
long way to stemming the threat in

655
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,320
actual terms of at the perimeter

656
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,720
defenses if you're using legitimate

657
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,000
credentials what can you do at that

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,980
stage it's very very difficult to defend

659
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,679
against so we say be more proactive then

660
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,539
look externally what's out there already

661
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,779
in regards to your your organization and

662
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,640
that'll go a long way to

663
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,559
stemming that thread

664
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,600
okay

665
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,710
thank you

666
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,900
