1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,600
good afternoon so as bob said this is

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,440
still very weird being in the room full

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,320
of

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
hundreds of people

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,799
so i'm still using my you know cheat

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,639
code but this time around on my phone so

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,759
if you see me looking down i'm probably

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,359
looking at my notes

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,720
um so

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,960
yeah we're talking about supply chain

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,480
attack interestingly enough i was going

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
to talk about around somewhere but then

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,000
i mean the room is full of ransomware

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
talk so

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
let's do something else um

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,040
we you know we all knew about what

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
happened with solarwinds because i have

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
vsa you know and i'm guessing most of

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,840
you have a question

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,920
what is supply chain

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
you know why am i talking about supply

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,719
chain

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,960
so i like this photo and that's the

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
reason why it's in this slide and i just

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,078
wanted everyone else to see it so

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
what a supply chain um

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
supply chain is a system of resources

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,520
that

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,120
needs to make either a product or a

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,840
service and in this you know in this

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
topic in this in this day we're going to

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
be talking about supply chain from cyber

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
security

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
so what is a supply chain attack a

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
supply chain attack is the type of

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
attack that targets organizations

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,799
um cyber criminals target organizations

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
weakest link so it's not just targeting

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
cyber cyber and cyber organizations or

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,840
i.t organizations but it's the weakest

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,479
link within these organizations

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,280
and

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,520
in this case your weakest link is your

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,880
third party vendor or supplier

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,680
so how does this happen

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,479
the purpose of this attack is to

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
compromise trusted service

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
again solarwinds very popular one um

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,079
and from there they are able to gain

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,040
access into more resources into

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,840
sensitive data into credentials

52
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
i'm going to be talking through the

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
three common types of supply chain

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
attack we have the malicious code

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,520
injection into private code base

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
we have the open source supply chain

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
attacks and in open source supply chain

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
attacks there are three different types

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
of attack vector typos quoting

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
dependency confusion malicious code

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
injection again and vendor email

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
compromise so we're going to be looking

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
at each of these types of attacks

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
so malicious code injection what is this

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
what happens here

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
the purpose of this is

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
an attacker scans

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
your network your company's network and

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,879
they're looking for a vulnerability

70
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,599
right so they find this vulnerability

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,400
and what do they want to do they want to

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,280
find a way to get in so they introduce

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
a malicious code into your vendor source

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
code

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
this is still the similar thing that

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,280
happened in solarwinds where 29 lines of

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
codes were you know added to solarwinds

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,640
on code and this was then you know sent

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
to their customers

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
so during the build process

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
the

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
legitimate code and the malicious code

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,599
then

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
automates into the update server thereby

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
pushing malware to

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,879
multiple customers i mean think of

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,200
trying to update one applications to a

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,519
hundred or a thousand endpoints think of

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
the damage that that could cost

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,879
so you as a customer you get this update

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
or patch as we called it um from your

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,920
vendor your trusted vendor your trusted

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,519
supplier and you then update the server

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
when you update your server you're

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
indirectly

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,400
initiating a communication with the

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,519
attacker

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
unknowingly of course because this was a

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
trusted supplier

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,360
and then you know sometimes behind the

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
scenes it could either be apt or it

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
could be a command and control server

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,959
from a you know a random hacker sitting

104
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,080
down in their

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
backyard

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
we have open source supply chain attack

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
um i think joe talked about security by

108
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,959
default um you know we like to call it

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
industry watch security by design

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,920
um i think the the concept of security

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
by design being essential to a company's

112
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
network and infrastructure

113
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,639
is a conversation that should be had

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,238
between devops team and senior

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,600
management

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,160
um it's not enough to build code to

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
solve a problem you need to build secure

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
code you need to build secure products

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,759
so

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
you're a software engineer right um

121
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
taking calls from the internet is

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
probably

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
might be your day job

124
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
might not be your day job

125
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,600
um i mean if the code exists and it's

126
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,080
ready for use why reinvent the real

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,800
right just use it from the internet

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
but

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,479
there is a downside to that because

130
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
most of the codes

131
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
online

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,080
are infiltrated malware different things

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
the attackers will you know infiltrate

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
public libraries adding adding different

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
types of malicious or malware codes and

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
you just go to the internet and you grab

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,759
that because it's an easy fix right so

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,120
let's look at the different types of

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
attack vectors in open source or

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
software supply chain attack

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,039
dependency confusion

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,320
very very interesting name

143
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
this is

144
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
a technique that involves tricking

145
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
software installer scripts to pull in

146
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,919
malicious packages from public

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,720
repository how is this done

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,759
so

149
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
when the attacker scans your network

150
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
because this can your network for

151
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
information all of this is around

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
reconnaissance so they scan your network

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
and they see that you have

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,800
a package a legitimate package called

155
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
acme node 1.2 right so they're like okay

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
well

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,919
you get

158
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
they might or might not know that you

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
get codes from online

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,240
so they then publish

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
a much higher version that you might

162
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,680
need at some point for your products

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
to the internet

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,400
and then

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
when automated software tools within

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
your organization then tries to

167
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,560
update their dependencies they might or

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
might not go through external or

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,199
internal you know public or

170
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,840
repositories or libraries and then when

171
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
they go external in this case they

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
automatically download malaysia's code

173
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
without knowing once again it's an easy

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,479
fix right so

175
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,160
you have established a connection

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,280
between

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,960
your network and the attacker

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
type of squatting we all make typos i

179
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
still make typos thank god for

180
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
autocorrect

181
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
um here

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
the attacker

183
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,319
pegs on human mistakes very very common

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
mistakes which is you know mixing a word

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
writing

186
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,919
one word before the other when it

187
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
shouldn't be that case

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
the attacker scans for a legitimate

189
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
public package so this this is

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
focused on the public repository the

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,680
public libraries that we would get

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
different quotes from

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
when the attacker scans for this they

194
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,199
then rename the package with a typo

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,840
multiple types of you know random typos

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,520
that we might use

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
and then

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
you as a devops engineer software

199
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,919
engineer you go to the internet and you

200
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
make similar mistakes it's possible

201
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,000
let's not say oh i don't make mistakes

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
we all make mistakes

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
so you then make this typo and then you

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,919
download the malicious

205
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,400
package from the internet down to your

206
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
network server again

207
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
the attacker has tricked you using human

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,520
mind using you know the mistakes that

209
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
human beings would make

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,039
so

211
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,720
what do we do

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
we try and review our

213
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,639
our letters we try and review whatever

214
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,919
we've written same way when you're

215
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
typing a message so fast you try and

216
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,039
read it before you send

217
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,919
and

218
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
it's not an easy fix but this is

219
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,080
something that is very possible to you

220
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,240
know it's a very easy mistake to make

221
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
when you're on the internet trying to

222
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,599
get codes

223
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,919
malicious code injection explained this

224
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,479
before but it's still similar and very

225
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
very common where

226
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,120
we would go to the internet software

227
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,919
teams devops teams looking for easy fix

228
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
trying to pull

229
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,240
data um you know from the internet and

230
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
or the attacker themselves trying to

231
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,679
infiltrate your code and trying to find

232
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,279
out okay what's happening how can i

233
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,200
infiltrate this network and get

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,599
information

235
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,440
vendor email compromise

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,279
it's a very popular one some people

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
might know it as business email

238
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
compromise

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
a lot of us you know different years of

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
experience would have probably heard one

241
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
or two stories about this it's very easy

242
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
but at the same time there's a lot of

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
financial loss when it comes to

244
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
attacks like this

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
here the attacker sends a phishing email

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
it could be you know related to kovid

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
the pandemic the vaccine

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
anything even related to work as well

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
and you as a recipient you get this

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
email it could be really good i've

251
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
failed fishing test as well before so

252
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
you know

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
everyone could be a victim um so

254
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,200
you go and click on this link and it's

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
like oh yeah you know update your

256
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
microsoft account or update your email

257
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
account and then you put in the

258
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,519
credentials

259
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,839
into this phishing site

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,040
and thereby

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
allowing the attacker still your

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
information you're not aware of this of

263
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,959
course but behind the scenes your email

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
address your passwords have been stolen

265
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
and then the attacker then monitors your

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,480
email they don't kick you out of your

267
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,839
email because they need you to establish

268
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
the communication they need you to lead

269
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
them to where

270
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
information or sensitive data or money

271
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,480
is

272
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,440
so

273
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
let's say they are able to get into a

274
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
financial

275
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
um you know accounts and then there's

276
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
invoices payments there's procurements

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
it's just so many conversations going on

278
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
and then what does the attacker do they

279
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,399
monitor the inbox

280
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,640
when it's time for payment

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
they then

282
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,040
reassign

283
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
the actual account that you or support

284
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
you as a client was supposed to pay your

285
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
vendor

286
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
and then you then

287
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
take this fake invoice and you're paying

288
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
the money and then maybe two weeks later

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
your vendor comes back to you to say oh

290
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
yeah i'm still waiting for that money

291
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,640
you know for the job that we've done and

292
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
it's like i paid you you know weeks ago

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
and it's like oh no you didn't pay me um

294
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
i can tell you for one that um i've

295
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
worked in a place where this happened

296
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,079
and it was huge financial loss for the

297
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,600
company

298
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
so why should you care

299
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,519
i mean i'm just probably standing here

300
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
blabbing right

301
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,640
um

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
it affects everyone um whether you're a

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
client you're a company or business

304
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,880
owner you're an employee or you're just

305
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
an individual it does affect everyone

306
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
um

307
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
you know it's there's a whole ecosystem

308
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
of communications of people of

309
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,519
connections

310
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
and it's a ripple effect take for

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
example if slag goes down um companies

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,279
are not able to communicate a lot of

313
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
companies depend on slack if amazon goes

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,800
down um your company could be you know

315
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
running or amazon goes down in a country

316
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
where your services have been hosted you

317
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
know you have a data center there you're

318
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
not able to communicate so maybe you

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
service different clients that's the

320
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,040
financial loss for yourself but this is

321
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,279
as a result of amazon's database going

322
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,560
down not your network just amazon

323
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
so you should care because any of us

324
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
really in this room could be victims you

325
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
could have your data stolen

326
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
from you know maybe an insurer that you

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
give your details to and someone is

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
impersonating you somewhere in china

329
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
and maybe stealing your your money as

330
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
well

331
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
so

332
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
what can we do to manage this threat

333
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,920
so many things we can we can do um i'm

334
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
just going to be focusing on three key

335
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,839
things that i think is important to

336
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
share to you third party risk management

337
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
because we're talking about supply chain

338
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
so supply chain is not just about you

339
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,079
it's about the people that you work with

340
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,320
your organization supply chain who is

341
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
connected to your network who offers

342
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
different services to you who who

343
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,760
provides you know even if it's the

344
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
cafeteria for example that's a supply

345
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
chain because you know they have access

346
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,959
to your building

347
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,800
do they provide you know

348
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
um pppe materials for you that's the

349
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,600
supply chain whether or not you don't

350
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,240
you know service the medical area

351
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
so third party risk management

352
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,279
example of a third party risk management

353
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,079
framework companies need to establish a

354
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,079
risk management framework

355
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
because

356
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,440
it's important

357
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,760
you need to develop

358
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,000
a framework within your organization to

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,959
assess

360
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,680
the risk for your vendors for your

361
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
suppliers

362
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
senior management must understand the

363
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,079
high risk that comes with dealing with

364
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,760
different third parties and what the

365
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,000
organizations are exposed to

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,519
regardless of your organization's risk

367
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
profile establishing a third party risk

368
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,959
management process is very important

369
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,800
and there are different ways to go about

370
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
it let's take for example analysis what

371
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
do you do there

372
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
you make an inventory of the third party

373
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
providers that you want to work with who

374
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,000
are they what do they do

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
where are they located what kind of

376
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,680
information are they going to have

377
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
into your network

378
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,360
why do you want to work with them it's

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,880
very important

380
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,000
because before onboarding a third party

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,639
you have to identify this risk

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
it's not enough whether they're best or

383
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
highly recommended or you know some

384
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
other company that uses them it's not

385
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
enough

386
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
so you develop a security rating based

387
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
on the engagement and the impacts

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
from these vendors into your network the

389
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,639
rating could go from low to high to even

390
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
critical

391
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,079
the purpose of this rating is to

392
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,399
understand where whether this third

393
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,720
party vendor meets your organization's

394
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
risk appetite because first you have to

395
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,880
have a risk appetite you have to

396
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
understand how much you're willing to

397
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,199
lose

398
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,160
or if you're willing to lose at all

399
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,880
and then you bring in contributions from

400
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
subject matter experts it's not enough

401
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
for the procurement team to carry out

402
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,279
the financial risk around this third

403
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
party it has to be from a cyber air

404
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
aspect as well it has to be from an

405
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,120
operational aspect so you're bringing in

406
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,040
delivery managers you're bringing senior

407
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
managers and different people from

408
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,399
different teams to understand

409
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,760
how should we

410
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
approach onboarding or how should we

411
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
approach bringing on this client or this

412
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
third party vendor into our network what

413
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
are the risks are there any risk what

414
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
kind of questions should we be asking

415
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
them and then this goes to engagement

416
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
and approval

417
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,199
so let's say you've carried out due

418
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,480
diligence right

419
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,120
everything is okay ticked all the boxes

420
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,040
how do you then engage this third party

421
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
if the vendor security you know matches

422
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
your risk appetite if you're okay with

423
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,360
it the next step is then to have them

424
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,839
complete a security questionnaire most

425
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
of you are probably very familiar with

426
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,880
security questionnaires with vendors

427
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
most of your vendors here as well

428
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,399
so

429
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,199
why do they need to complete this

430
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,199
risk um questionnaire or what the

431
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,440
security question here it's important

432
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
because

433
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
the questions give you insights into the

434
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,079
third party's security controls that are

435
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
not visible to the outside eyes they

436
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
might not actually have had that

437
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
communication with you during the first

438
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
process

439
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,800
so by giving them this questionnaire to

440
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
fill in you're getting more insight into

441
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,880
their network you're getting more

442
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
insight into their business operations

443
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
you're getting more insights into what's

444
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,040
important to them when it comes to cyber

445
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
security how are they going to manage

446
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,279
your data how are they going to you know

447
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
access your data are they storing your

448
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
data if they're storing your data where

449
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,519
are they storing your data if they're

450
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,079
storing your data in for example the u.s

451
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480
and you're based in europe is that okay

452
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
is gdpr permitting that these are

453
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,600
questions that arise from the security

454
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
questionnaire that you give your vendor

455
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
during the engagement and approval stage

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,920
um denise sp800 171 gives you an example

457
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,839
of the kind of questions that you should

458
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,399
ask your third-party vendor very

459
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,600
important

460
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
so let's say you've you know again

461
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
checked all the boxes

462
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
you're on boarding your security uh

463
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,519
sorry you're on boarding your your

464
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
third-party vendor

465
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,360
what happens then

466
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,519
they've received the approval right

467
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,920
it's important to configure your

468
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
third-party vendor with zero trust in

469
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,880
mind

470
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
i know this sounds again like a buzzword

471
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
but we'll come to it with zero trust in

472
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
mind it's important because

473
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,040
your third-party vendor should not have

474
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
more access than they need

475
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,600
it's not enough again because maybe they

476
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
have access to

477
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,759
they're managing your your your server

478
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,679
maybe one server and they're like okay

479
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,280
well let me just give them access to all

480
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
my servers because they could manage my

481
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,480
server no you need to restrict access

482
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,720
and configure access again with zero

483
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,959
trust giving them just access to what

484
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,000
they need and also making sure

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
that the server or whatever systems that

486
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
you're giving them access to

487
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
is restricted so they shouldn't be able

488
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
to do more than they are doing they

489
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
shouldn't be able to do more that they

490
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
need to do and they shouldn't be able to

491
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
creep around because

492
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,160
as we all know it only takes one

493
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
credentials to leak and then there's an

494
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
escalation of privileges when it comes

495
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,120
to supply chain attacks

496
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,520
so then we go to

497
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
performance and monitoring

498
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
it's

499
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
more important to

500
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
even more more important now that this

501
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
client or this vendor has been of you

502
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
know onboarded to your network to

503
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,919
monitor them

504
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
and monitoring them doesn't just mean

505
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
checking when they log in and checking

506
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
when they log out it's more than that

507
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
it's checking the changes that they make

508
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,200
when they log in

509
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
is checking the times that they log in

510
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
it's checking

511
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,679
the the actions that are taken during

512
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
the times when they're logging whether

513
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,600
it's the right time whether it's not the

514
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,799
right time um i think jorgen mentioned

515
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,559
the thing about the domain account and

516
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,400
checking the 10 minutes and 20 minutes

517
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,799
of the domain accounts lockout those

518
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,960
times are very important

519
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
so if anything

520
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,559
when monitoring them

521
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
make sure that you're monitoring them

522
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
for the right reasons because now they

523
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,799
have access to sensitive data they have

524
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,280
access to your

525
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
i don't know your logs they have access

526
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,240
to your your systems you know your your

527
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
business your business

528
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,679
network it's it's just you're as exposed

529
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,880
as

530
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,160
they are to the internet

531
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,520
so

532
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
you do that and this is where continuous

533
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
security monitoring comes into play

534
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
under performance and monitoring

535
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,679
and

536
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
see at css csm is a threat intelligence

537
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,679
approach that automates monitoring of

538
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,039
information security controls

539
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
vulnerabilities for clients

540
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
the last one exits from the contract so

541
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,840
let's say this client or this

542
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
third-party vendor has fulfilled its

543
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
purpose and maybe you want to move on

544
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,960
you need to make sure you need to verify

545
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
that the access that they had they are

546
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
off-boarded properly so you've onboarded

547
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
them and it's time to off-board them

548
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,039
it's very important to make sure that

549
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,600
the right the access the data that they

550
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
have

551
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,200
is all returned or deleted during due

552
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
diligence

553
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
so

554
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,919
examples of potential risk that

555
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,520
companies faces

556
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
reputational risk

557
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
we could mention the thousand clients or

558
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
customers in this or companies in this

559
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,919
place that have faced reputational risk

560
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
in the last 12 to 24 months

561
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,559
operational risk

562
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,400
cyber security risk

563
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,159
the an answer here talks about 66

564
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,080
percent of the attacks

565
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,039
focused on suppliers code again very

566
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,760
important to know what you're testing to

567
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
know what you're installing to know what

568
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
you're patching to know what you're

569
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
updating also

570
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,840
62 percent of this attacks

571
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
exploit comes from the trust of the

572
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
companies and the customers of their

573
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,760
suppliers so again zero trust in mind

574
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
financial risk we talked about the

575
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,799
vendor

576
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,039
email compromise where you pay money

577
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,440
into the wrong person you pay money into

578
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,039
the wrong account

579
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,360
this happens all well too too much in

580
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
the industry

581
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
implementing a zero trust model

582
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,679
i like that diagram

583
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,799
um

584
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,679
it's you know it's very important to

585
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,320
to look at these things from a realism

586
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,039
point of view because

587
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,440
these cyber criminals are

588
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,919
they that they're trying to use our

589
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,280
minds our our human nature you know the

590
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
trust where you bring in a third party a

591
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,559
trusted third party so not just any

592
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,039
third party trusted third party like

593
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,440
solarwinds into your network

594
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
thousands of companies over 18 000

595
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,559
customers are using you know solo wins

596
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
and then what do they do

597
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
they infiltrate your trusted suppliers

598
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,360
access network into your network just to

599
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,559
gain information it's terrible

600
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
by implementing a zero trust model

601
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,919
organizations are able to control access

602
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
to their data and their infrastructure

603
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,799
by enabling this privilege again giving

604
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,039
them access to only what they need and

605
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,679
not what they wanted to to have

606
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
and this verification process is one of

607
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,240
the aspects that xero trust talks about

608
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,919
where

609
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,159
take for example you have a contractor

610
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,640
that has access to one of your server

611
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
and then the contractor you know might

612
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
need access to a different server

613
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,960
it's not enough to say oh yeah i know

614
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,480
that person or we already give that

615
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
person access to this server so let's

616
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
just give him access you have to

617
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
re-verify

618
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
re-verification

619
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
doesn't stop within your network

620
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,799
especially when you're dealing with

621
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
contractors third-party vendors

622
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,159
third-party suppliers when you're

623
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
dealing with people that have access to

624
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,280
sensitive data re-verification is very

625
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
important

626
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,159
pen testing

627
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,320
another popular one testing testing

628
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,919
testing

629
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,919
a lot of companies set up dev

630
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
environments and say oh yeah we run the

631
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,320
patch you know we we we run this patch

632
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,760
on the dev environment it was fine

633
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,679
nothing went down so it's time to move

634
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,120
to production

635
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,919
but you're not treating your development

636
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,480
environment as your production what are

637
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,159
the security controls are you checking

638
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,720
for abnormalities are you checking for

639
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,280
you know different changes in in code

640
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
lines for example solarwinds again 29

641
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,159
lines of codes that's a lot of code in

642
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
my opinion but that went unnoticed to a

643
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,840
lot of customers even solarwinds

644
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
themselves

645
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,919
so testing your environment for

646
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,840
abnormalities testing your environments

647
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,919
for back doors testing your environment

648
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
for any sort of change that isn't usual

649
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,080
is very important

650
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
so

651
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,719
what are my final thoughts

652
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,040
coming to the end of this feel sad now

653
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,090
[Laughter]

654
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,279
[Music]

655
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,440
the nationals institute of standards and

656
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
technology states in their software

657
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,440
supply chain

658
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
attack information sheets that encode

659
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,440
software supply chain are particularly

660
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
bothersome and insidious because they

661
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,320
violate the basic and assume trust

662
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,480
between software provider

663
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,320
and consumer

664
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,360
they also predict that these attacks

665
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
soft supply chain attacks

666
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
are gonna grow more and more

667
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,840
and we would have

668
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,279
almost no resources almost no

669
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,240
plans to control them

670
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
defenders and those who manage corporate

671
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,200
risk

672
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
must focus on where trust is being

673
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
granted

674
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
trust again

675
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
because well we trust these people in

676
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
our network we give them access it's

677
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
like opening your door to a friend

678
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,360
and

679
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,760
if the trust is abused what do we do

680
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
if you give access to your third-party

681
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,559
vendor and they are compromised and as a

682
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,679
result you're compromised what do you do

683
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
what does your company do

684
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,720
in your

685
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,960
third-party risk management

686
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
do you have plans for when your vendor

687
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
is compromised

688
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
do you have any

689
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
business continuity plan for what you do

690
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,159
when this happens

691
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
we need to shift from a model of trust

692
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
to a model of trust and verify

693
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
re-verification again of access

694
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
of rights

695
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,120
of who has

696
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,279
you know access to your servers to your

697
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,559
network to your firewall all of those

698
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,559
and if we can focus on building

699
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,400
safeguards around our most trusted

700
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,520
assets again knowing your inventory

701
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
it will provide the redundancy that we

702
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,279
need to mitigate

703
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,640
if not even prevent supply chain attacks

704
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,380
thank you

705
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:49,520
[Applause]

706
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,039
sweetheart my timer has been asking me

707
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,520
to stop talking

708
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
does anyone have any questions

709
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,810
yes please

710
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,899
[Music]

711
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,279
that's a good one

712
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,039
during my research i did come across

713
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,159
even fifth and sixth parties

714
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,440
i think

715
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
we have to start with who has you know

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,840
access first to our networks and you

717
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,440
know when it comes to

718
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
the tm

719
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,200
the the or the trm the the risk

720
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,720
management profile

721
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,360
by having your vendor

722
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,240
carry out the risk questionnaire you're

723
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,799
aware you're informed of who has access

724
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,840
to their data and thereby having access

725
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
to your data

726
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
so

727
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
first is awareness because sometimes you

728
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,360
know companies onboard third parties

729
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,679
for a service and those third parties

730
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,000
then outsource the service

731
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
to another third party

732
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
so that's where the fourth and the fifth

733
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
party comes into place so if you

734
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,520
understand the business model of your

735
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,159
third party you would then have you know

736
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,240
the information that you need to know if

737
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
this this service that i'm outsourcing

738
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
now is it going to be re-outsourced and

739
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,720
if it is am i okay with it do i want to

740
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
work for this client and i'm not saying

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
that that's a bad thing in general

742
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
it's just understanding and carrying out

743
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,520
due internal audit due diligence around

744
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,039
who has access to your data and the

745
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,120
person that has access the client the

746
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,440
company the customer that has access to

747
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,159
your data who has access to their data

748
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,200
so it's just all about audits and i mean

749
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
i'm not giving you a quick fix here

750
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,200
because there's none and we always have

751
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
to just

752
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
check these things you know you have to

753
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
check them you have to make sure that

754
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
you take

755
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
not just the boxes but make sure that

756
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,039
you're taking the right boxes as to

757
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,000
you know

758
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,679
where's your data being stored and who's

759
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,799
going to access your data

760
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
so um i've been asked to get off the

761
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
stage so

762
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,000
i think i'm going to go now and i'm

763
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
around to the end so if anyone else has

764
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,559
any questions i'm very happy to have a

765
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,918
conversation with you thank you
