1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,600
um welcome to the 37th ransomware talk

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,879
of the day

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
uh so i mean i

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,599
i guess that is sort of uh

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
right so here we go

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,519
so i mean it sort of goes without saying

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,039
ransomware apparently is kind of a big

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,359
deal uh and we're hearing a lot about it

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
you guys might be familiar with one of

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,840
these um but it turns out it's not the

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,760
only ransomware attack that happened in

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
ireland this year uh there were a few

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,079
others um and probably actually a lot

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,360
more than we know about because one of

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,480
the big problems we do have with

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,239
ransomware is that it is currently

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
massively underreported so the data we

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,520
have while very useful is incomplete

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
it's a good thing to bear in mind as we

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,600
go through um so

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,120
you will recall

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,440
the hse attack i'm assuming everyone's

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,520
heard of that one um

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
it's it's very relevant to the talk

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
track of the ransomware task force

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
because what happened is

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,000
you might have heard of another big

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
thing that's happened recently a thing

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
called covid uh and

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
during the past two years hospitals have

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,479
been sort of attacked pretty much uh

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,560
broad scale across the world

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,119
and so recognizing this

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,799
the institute for security and

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
technology which is a

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
um it's a think tank on the west coast

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,000
in the us and it sort of sits at the

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,640
intersection of security and technology

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
as its name suggests and public policy

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
they sort of look to the fact that the

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
pandemic the actual pandemic not the

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,560
cyber pandemic uh was um i just put that

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,360
in for victoria was was was actually

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
being sort of exacerbated by the fact

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
that hospitals were having to

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
um deal with these attacks constantly

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and that that was impacting um health

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
delivery and so they looked at

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
ransomware and they

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,040
said uh

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
it's it's actually creating a big

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,719
societal issue and we should do

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
something about it

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
so they thought well why don't we create

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
a task force to tackle this

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
and i

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
was a little

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,959
skeptical to begin with

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,959
because um as i think many people have

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
mentioned today ransomware's not a new

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
thing not a new topic

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
and it's been around for a really long

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,200
time if you google ransomware you will

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
find that plenty of security vendors

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
have provided a great deal of

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
information for you to look at telling

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
you things to do about ransomware so

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
my question was how is the task force

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,040
really going to

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
change things build on things you know

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,640
what's it going to do differently

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,040
and and phil who is at the institute of

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
security and technology and who was

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
behind this whole idea his response was

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
we're not doing what they've done our

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
goal isn't to just come out with another

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
thing that says

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
pat your and uh segment your

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
network our goal is to look at societal

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
solutions look at macro solutions

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,840
and really what he was zeroing in on was

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,360
there was a new administration coming

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
into the us so the time frame for this

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,640
conversation was sort of november last

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
year new administration coming into the

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,519
white house

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,519
they'd already said

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,800
hey

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
we are going to focus on security

90
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
security is going to be a big thing for

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,440
us they had committed budget that kind

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,400
of thing

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
and so his point of view was if we can

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
get a group of experts together

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,480
and we can

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
um look at coming up with a set of

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
recommendations that are aimed at

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
policymakers and we can hand it to the

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,440
new administration just to that point

100
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,560
where they've started to get their feet

101
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,599
under them but they haven't actually

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,360
built their full agenda

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
maybe we can actually influence the the

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,280
directions they go in

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
so that was the the idea so then he went

106
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
about and he found

107
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
a lot of different people to talk to um

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,480
the task force officially had more than

109
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
60 people who participated in reality

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
it was i mean just huge numbers higher

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
than that um at least over 100 on a

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,599
regular basis and then we interviewed

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
so many people

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
in organizations that have been victim

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
to attacks in organizations of all

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
different sizes to understand

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,040
preparedness levels

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
we talk to cyber insurers we talk to

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
incident responders we talk to law

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,840
enforcement we talk to lawyers

121
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,439
academics you named it if they have an

122
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,000
opinion on ransomware we talked to them

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
and we brought all of that together and

124
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,358
kind of put it into a melting pot

125
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,000
and um and we came out with a report

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
because who doesn't love yet another

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,639
report on cyber security um

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,720
the report came out

129
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,320
uh for those who are very eagle-eyed on

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
their dates a week before the colonial

131
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
pipeline attack

132
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,400
any suggestion that we may have had

133
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
anything to do with that

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
is completely false uh and the colonial

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
pipeline attack i think was a week

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,840
before hse and then jbs followed very

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
closely after that so we had this sort

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
of weird run of three

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,840
very very very high profile ransomware

140
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
attacks and that actually from a report

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
point of view and a government

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,160
engagement point of view

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,880
was kind of helpful as terrible as that

144
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
sounds

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,720
because the point that it made that it

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
helped sort of highlight to governments

147
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,600
was this is a societal issue it requires

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
societal responses simply taking a step

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,479
back and saying this is on organizations

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
to sort out and figure out isn't gonna

151
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
be enough it hasn't been enough it

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
hasn't got us where we need to get to

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,919
so what else can we do how can we move

154
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,880
forward

155
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
um

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
so

157
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
as mentioned we came up with 48

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
recommendations the really good news for

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
you guys since it is late in the day as

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
i'm not going to take you through all

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
48. um i'm going to give you sort of a

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
high level overview

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,560
the the framework we applied to come up

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
with the recommendations was these four

165
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
principles how do you

166
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
deter ransomware attackers how do you

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,960
disrupt runs away attacks how do you

168
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,600
help organizations prepare at scale and

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
how do you help them respond at scale

170
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
um

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,000
a quick note before i go into the

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
recommendations

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
as i mentioned the

174
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
the sort of guiding principle on pulling

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
together the task force was very focused

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,080
on the us administration

177
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
and

178
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
i was the only non-us i was actually

179
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
more or less the on not only non

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
former us government chair

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
of the task force but

182
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
we had participation from law

183
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
enforcement around the world um

184
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,919
europol was part of it for example uh so

185
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,039
a quick shout out to philip for that

186
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,520
we had ncsc in the uk we had the rcmp

187
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
um in canada we had various

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
organizations from the us government we

189
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
tried to get as much international

190
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
flavor in as we could

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
and our

192
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
view is that a lot of the

193
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
recommendations while the detail of them

194
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,720
the specifics are oriented towards u.s

195
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,120
legislation we believe the principle

196
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
behind them can be adopted more broadly

197
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
by other governments including uh this

198
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,759
one

199
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
so the number one thing was we really

200
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,240
wanted to see

201
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
um a firstly a sort of whole of

202
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,880
government uh response a sort of joined

203
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
up whole of government response but we

204
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,759
also really wanted to see a sort of

205
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,639
senior leadership acknowledgement

206
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
of ransomware as being a societal issue

207
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
um actually it being a national security

208
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
threat which again these are words that

209
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
i think i personally like sometimes

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
think national security isn't that about

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
sort of tanks and bombs

212
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
but actually when you have hospitals and

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
pipelines closing down that that is a

214
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
threat um to the nation

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
uh and to the national economy um the

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the jbs attack

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
i

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
i made fun of the fact that people were

219
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
getting very fired up about the cost of

220
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
chicken wings until a colleague of mine

221
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,199
reminded me rightly

222
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,080
that

223
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,560
in the u.s chicken wings are a staple

224
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
for families that live below the poverty

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
line the fact that chicken wings are

226
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
still 10 cents more expensive today than

227
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,879
they were before that attack has a

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,960
profound effect

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
on those families living below the

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,160
poverty line

231
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
so you are looking at economic and

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
social repercussions we wanted that to

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
be recognized by governments

234
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,879
so what's happened since then

235
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,360
well um firstly the g7 lined up on a

236
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
beach in cornwall to do the macarena

237
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,080
and then they um

238
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,839
awkwardly uh then they put out a

239
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,279
communique they put out this communique

240
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,719
after they meet and it goes through like

241
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,839
all the different things they talked

242
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
about and all the commitments they made

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
and they talked about ransomware which

244
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
is kind of insane and they said hey

245
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
we're going to work together on this

246
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,680
it's going to be a thing and we're going

247
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,040
to try and really focus on it now the g7

248
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
then followed up and said before the end

249
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
of this year

250
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,360
we will meet specifically on ransomware

251
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,959
to come up with a set

252
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
of commitments that we're going to make

253
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,080
that meeting is currently being worked

254
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,440
on for december

255
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,959
and we look forward to hearing what the

256
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,120
commitments will be to take into the new

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
year

258
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
so

259
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,760
the other thing that happened

260
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
is the president of the united states of

261
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
america has talked about ransomware on

262
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
public television

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,160
at least eight times this year which

264
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,959
when you really think about it is kind

265
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
of astonishing i mean it kind of puts

266
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,959
cyber security in a frame for your

267
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,519
average citizen in a way that it just

268
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,279
hasn't before

269
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
so the fact that they did this and then

270
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
the white house sent out a bulletin to

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
people saying like hey you really need

272
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,519
to take action and here's what that

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,920
looks like again these are really strong

274
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
indicators that they're taking it super

275
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,399
seriously the department of justice

276
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
um also reclassified how they think

277
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,959
about uh ransomware and said we're gonna

278
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,040
treat it on the same level as terrorism

279
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,000
there has been a very joined up response

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
through u.s government we've seen

281
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
treasury come out with things we're

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
seeing sector regulators come out with

283
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,839
things we're seeing congress try and get

284
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
in on the act now with reporting

285
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
requirements so

286
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
there is in the us this sort of very

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,240
joined up point of view i will say like

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,200
we've talked to a lot of other

289
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
governments they are

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
not making the noise that the us

291
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
government is making on this but they

292
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
are certainly paying a lot of attention

293
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
to the problem and really trying to

294
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,079
understand how they can also get to the

295
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
sort of joined up response and what that

296
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
would look like

297
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
so this the next big thing was okay

298
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
great you have an individual government

299
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
pay attention and sort of stand up to be

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
counted we would like them to

301
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
collaborate together we would like them

302
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,000
to coordinate

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,360
their efforts

304
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,320
and

305
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
in particular it's very important that

306
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
they tackle safe havens

307
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,399
not because i specifically hate this

308
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
movie though that is true too

309
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
um

310
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
safe havens are nation states that

311
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
basically create a safe space for

312
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
attackers either because they can't

313
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
prosecute or because they won't

314
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,399
prosecute

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,560
so what we would like

316
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,839
is we would like the governments that

317
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,440
are affected by ransomware attacks to

318
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,279
figure out how to address that in the

319
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,839
case of governments nations that can't

320
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,279
prosecute

321
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
that normally comes down to things like

322
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,399
they don't have the resources they don't

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,120
have the training those kinds of things

324
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
so

325
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
the solutions there become a little bit

326
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,760
more obvious right you can you can

327
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
provide training you can you can provide

328
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
funding you can provide staff

329
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
um it's expensive to do it but you can

330
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,200
do it

331
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
the problem comes with nations that

332
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,320
won't prosecute

333
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
and there are all sorts of sort of you

334
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
know dialogue around why nations do this

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
there's you know a lot of people like to

336
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
talk about the fact that it furthers the

337
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,839
political aims or ambitions of certain

338
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,800
nations um

339
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
in this situation

340
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,760
the

341
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,880
classic

342
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,560
diplomacy

343
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,839
um

344
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,639
tools that we have in our arsenal i'm

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,839
trying not to use ministry language but

346
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
it's hard um

347
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
they are they are not working right

348
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,839
sanctions have not traditionally worked

349
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,200
um on this problem and so

350
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,040
sanctions is a completely viable thing

351
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,480
to look into but we have to figure out

352
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,079
how to make it work and how to like get

353
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
it taken very seriously but some things

354
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,160
have happened on this so after that g7

355
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
summit president biden went to russia

356
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
and he met with president putin who

357
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
looks very strange in this picture

358
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
and

359
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,600
um biden said to putin hey you've got to

360
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,560
stop attacking our critical

361
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,440
infrastructure like we're drawing a line

362
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,399
no more attacking the critical

363
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
infrastructure or else

364
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,000
the or else was not super clear but he

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,040
said it and they needed a press

366
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,240
conference afterwards i made a big deal

367
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
about the fact he said it

368
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,880
the jury is somewhat out on what the

369
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
impact of that has been but it does seem

370
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
as though the us government is willing

371
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
to sort of put its money where its mouth

372
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
is and follow through

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,600
they have you know um taken action like

374
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,519
the the recent um action against

375
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,880
our evil i'm laughing because it always

376
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,920
makes me feel like i should do a pirate

377
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
accent like are evil

378
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,600
um

379
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
but yeah so they are now looking at sort

380
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
of actions they can take and ways that

381
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
they can continue to draw this line

382
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,399
i think time will tell

383
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,519
how effective this has been um there was

384
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
some discussion you know about over the

385
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
summer about whether black mata's

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,240
website indicated that ransomware

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
attackers heard this message and got

388
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
very scared and we're not going to go

389
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
after critical infrastructure and it's

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
more likely they were on holiday so

391
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
we've certainly seen attacks ramp back

392
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,440
up again

393
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,839
through um september and october

394
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,079
um other things have happened so uh the

395
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,360
us and nato got together and they put

396
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
out a statement saying

397
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
ooh china bad china stopped using

398
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
microsoft exchange vulnerabilities um i

399
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
had not seen them do something like this

400
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
before particularly nato so this was

401
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
kind of interesting to see them take

402
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
that stance like draw that line

403
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
um

404
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
again

405
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,600
hard to quantify

406
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,399
what impact this kind of thing has but i

407
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,000
think once they make the public

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,240
statements that say we want to draw a

409
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
line the question becomes okay well how

410
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,519
are you going to follow through with

411
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
that how where is that line going to be

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,120
and how you're going to enforce it which

413
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
is when we come back to things like do

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
sanctions work um

415
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
just quick show of hands how many people

416
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
are familiar with the sanctions that the

417
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
u.s treasury department has introduced

418
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,040
connected to ransomware okay so um i

419
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,000
will briefly um

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
so they've taken two primary approaches

421
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
to this one is that they have applied

422
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
sanctions to making payments to specific

423
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,600
ransomware groups ransomware actors

424
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,839
um

425
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
so what they're saying is you can't you

426
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,199
can't make a payment to them right um

427
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,560
they're putting them in a specialized

428
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
group and saying these these people

429
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,000
can't have payments

430
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,839
i i personally think that's a game of

431
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
whack-a-mole i think you are

432
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
uh you're just

433
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,959
all that will happen is they'll rebrand

434
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,880
they'll go underground and rebrand um

435
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,399
the other approach they've taken is

436
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,800
they've put a sanction on a specific

437
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
exchange and cryptocurrency which we'll

438
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
talk about a little bit more is an

439
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,160
avenue that's interesting and worth

440
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,000
pursuing and it's a little bit less of a

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
moving target so i think that has a

442
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
little bit more potential to be um

443
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
impactful

444
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,480
um so the eu and the us also launched

445
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
the initiative against ransomware i will

446
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,360
say this is one of those things where

447
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
they put out a press release that was a

448
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
big thing and then we don't really know

449
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
what it means there hasn't been a huge

450
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,800
amount of substance or follow-through i

451
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
suspect that there are operations in

452
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
flight uh that are happening in secret

453
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,320
and we will hear about them when they

454
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
have successes to share um so again i

455
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
look forward to hearing more about what

456
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
this actually means

457
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,759
so then the next big category

458
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
uh and this is a this is a biggie uh

459
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
this covers a lot of things is reduce

460
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
opportunities for attackers to get paid

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,839
so the rationale here is pretty

462
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,800
straightforward if extortion based

463
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
attacks are basically profit driven

464
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
profit motivated um the reasoning goes

465
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
that if we can uh make it harder for

466
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,560
them to get paid then less people will

467
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,079
flood into the market this is all a good

468
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,680
thing for us so what are the ways that

469
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,639
we can do this there are lots of

470
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,959
different things i mean this

471
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
was the challenge for us as i think it's

472
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
the challenge for everybody in this room

473
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,839
right there isn't a silver bullet for

474
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,759
ransomware unfortunately just once in

475
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,040
security i would like somebody to be

476
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,160
like no you know what there is a silver

477
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,480
bullet i know what it is and here it is

478
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
but that just never happens and so what

479
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
we came up with with our 48 things was a

480
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
lot of little things that you could do

481
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,279
that individually

482
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,040
aren't going to solve much but if you

483
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,360
sort of do them cumulatively

484
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,759
then they might start building a path to

485
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
progress so what do some of those things

486
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
look like well the first is

487
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
cryptocurrencies as i mentioned

488
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,600
there are existing cryptocurrency

489
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
regulations things like know your

490
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,160
customer which somebody mentioned

491
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,199
earlier

492
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
and they are not applied evenly

493
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,959
internationally

494
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
um and so

495
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,320
we're not even saying hey come up with

496
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
new regulation we're saying make sure

497
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
that the regulation that already exists

498
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
is being applied consistently um and and

499
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,799
sort of you know work with international

500
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,119
governments to help make that happen

501
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,799
that should uh improve things a little

502
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
bit i will say

503
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
cryptocurrency is a big focus there was

504
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,319
a white house summit

505
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,119
with about 30 countries in october

506
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,559
cryptocurrency ended up being a big

507
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,640
focus i have

508
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,359
heard it maybe revisited as a topic at

509
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,520
the g7 conversation so i think we can

510
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
expect to see more on this i think in

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
general what we have not seen and what i

512
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
hope we will continue to not see is an

513
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,400
attitude of cryptocurrency as evil we

514
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
should kill it um it is you know if you

515
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
look at any of the reports that come out

516
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
around um cryptocurrency tracking like

517
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
the chain analysis reports and that kind

518
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,840
of thing

519
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,919
cybercrime equates for less than one

520
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,960
percent

521
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,120
of the business conducted so i i think

522
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,320
it would be wrong to just sort of say we

523
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
should get rid of cryptocurrency but we

524
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
do need to think about the role that

525
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
it's playing

526
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,960
next thing is looking at the measures

527
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
that organizations take so

528
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,240
um bob controversially earlier on

529
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,320
mentioned about

530
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
um

531
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
the fact that people sort of spend time

532
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
looking for decryption tools and they're

533
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
not available

534
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
philip responded and said actually they

535
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
are available and we have seen them work

536
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
and we've saved over 900 million uh

537
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
dollars in unpaid ransoms

538
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
um what we found as a group when we

539
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,600
interviewed people

540
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
was that actually

541
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
most people don't look

542
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
um they don't know to look they don't

543
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
think of looking they're in a panic they

544
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
want the problem to go away as quickly

545
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
as possible they sleep straight to a

546
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
conversation of whether or not to pay

547
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
and don't stop to look for decryption

548
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,799
tools

549
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
so

550
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
one of the things that we suggested is

551
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,200
that there could be more of a

552
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
requirement for organizations to do more

553
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
due diligence

554
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
um we do believe that no more ransom is

555
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,640
great project we fully support it

556
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
um we would like the us government to

557
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,120
participate but they they don't want to

558
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,840
um but we we do recommend it

559
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,520
um another thing is that we believe that

560
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
governments particularly um in more

561
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
developed economies should look at con

562
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
whether they can provide a safety net

563
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,200
for their most vulnerable or critical

564
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,559
organizations

565
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,960
so um critical infrastructure and your

566
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
small to medium businesses can you set

567
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,080
up a fund

568
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
that enables them to get on a path to

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,080
recovery and can you also provide

570
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
resources to help them with that um or

571
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,559
can you provide the resources for

572
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,640
preventative measures so for example if

573
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,000
you are

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,600
um

575
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
i was gonna say an sltt but i'm gonna

576
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
have to now go state local

577
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
tribal or territory

578
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,679
and that's what it is in the u.s which

579
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,799
is the sort of local all the different

580
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
types of local government

581
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440
um

582
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,520
scissor the uh department of homeland

583
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
security's department which is the

584
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
critical infrastructure security cyber

585
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,000
security and critical infrastructure

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,919
security agency

587
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,880
um

588
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,400
they have a bunch of free services that

589
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,320
they provide right to help

590
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,559
state and locals and other areas of

591
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
critical infrastructure

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
uh

593
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,400
basically avoid becoming victims so

594
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
that's the kind of thing can we do more

595
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
of that help help organizations adopt

596
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
these um

597
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,159
these uh capabilities give them a fund i

598
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,679
mean you could make it so that they pay

599
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:18,799
back but they pay back through

600
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,400
preferential timings or whatever terms

601
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
um

602
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
and then the other thing

603
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,520
is um mandating reporting so as i said

604
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,400
at the very beginning one of the

605
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
problems we have with ransomware is too

606
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,159
little information too little clarity of

607
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,120
what's really going on um the idea of

608
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,640
having some regulation to mandate

609
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,679
reporting

610
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,840
uh we talked earlier on about gdpr

611
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,559
having some requirement for this the nis

612
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
directive is currently being updated by

613
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,760
the eu

614
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,039
nist ii

615
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,880
will have broader mandates for reporting

616
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
um in the u.s there is a piece of

617
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,679
legislation currently going through

618
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,080
congress which mandates the reporting of

619
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
ransom incidents um and

620
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,240
for the task force one of the things

621
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
that we considered might be an idea

622
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,760
would be to have an independent body

623
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
that people could report to because one

624
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,039
of the things that we hear is that

625
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,799
organizations are afraid of reporting

626
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,159
because they're afraid of regulatory

627
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,159
response so the idea was we would have a

628
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,440
sort of clearinghouse that would

629
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
aggregate and anonymize the data

630
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,400
share it out to the relevant people and

631
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
could act as a liaison with government

632
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
entities or enforcement if necessary but

633
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
wouldn't sort of require it of people

634
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
um

635
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,640
now

636
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,960
the thing we always get asked about is

637
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,039
prohibiting payments should we ban

638
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,240
payments

639
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,679
and we talked about it at length and we

640
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,360
couldn't come to agreement on this

641
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
um there may have been some

642
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,159
friendly arguments over this topic and i

643
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,360
think you know everybody had a sort of

644
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,919
good intent behind it

645
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
pretty much everybody agreed

646
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,600
paying ransoms is not

647
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,880
palatable

648
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,919
and

649
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
in general seems like a bad idea

650
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
in that you are legitimizing crime

651
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
you're funding crime or enabling the bad

652
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
guys to invest more in their

653
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,840
infrastructure and their

654
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,720
capabilities um

655
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
you

656
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
could be funding other kinds of crime

657
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
which is also not very nice

658
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,520
um and the more that

659
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,600
other people see those headlines about

660
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
big paydays the more people flood into

661
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
the market and you get like a lot more

662
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
attackers right

663
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,679
and again the reasoning applies that if

664
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,440
you ban payments and then you send a

665
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,799
strong signal to attackers that says

666
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
you're definitely not getting paid that

667
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,080
then they will go and they will do other

668
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
things with their time they'll just go

669
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,799
i'll go straight it'll be fine um

670
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,120
the reality though is i don't know that

671
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
anyone's super sold on the idea that

672
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,400
they'll just be like time to get a

673
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
proper job um

674
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,200
it's much more likely that they're gonna

675
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
play a game of chicken

676
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
and if i were a ransomware attacker

677
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
which i'm not

678
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,120
uh and i keep saying it into the

679
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
microphone

680
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,679
um

681
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,520
i would start by targeting organizations

682
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
that have the least ability

683
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
to resist payment

684
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,120
so critical infrastructure because they

685
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
have no tolerance for disruption

686
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,159
and small businesses because they have

687
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,880
very little resilience typically

688
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,559
i that's what i would go after so you're

689
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,799
basically if you if you ban payments

690
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,280
today from where we are right now

691
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
you are drawing a giant target i i

692
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,960
believe

693
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
on your most critical and your most

694
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,159
vulnerable

695
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,320
if instead you say hey our goal is to

696
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
get to a prohibition of payments we want

697
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
to get to that goal in two years three

698
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,679
years

699
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,960
then you can figure out what steps you

700
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,080
need to take and then you go back to

701
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,039
looking at the things that we just

702
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,240
talked about things like creating a

703
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,799
safety net having reporting looking at

704
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,039
the role of cryptocurrencies uh driving

705
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
adoption of preventative measures those

706
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,159
kinds of things

707
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,279
so that's why we didn't put in a

708
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,720
recommendation for prohibition of

709
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
payments although there was

710
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
an interest in getting there

711
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,240
so last one i promise you um a clearer

712
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
path to preparedness and response one of

713
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
the things that we heard overwhelmingly

714
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
from people and you might feel some

715
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
sympathy with this after sitting through

716
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,559
37 ransomware talks today

717
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
we heard from people

718
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
that there's a ton of

719
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,720
information about ransomware oh did i

720
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,840
mention i have a bit of a potty mouth

721
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
sorry about that uh and it's

722
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
overwhelming and it's confusing a lot of

723
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
guidance is either like really

724
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,640
simplified or it's really complicated

725
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,240
it's not tailored to your sector it's

726
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,600
not tailored to your size of

727
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,840
organization it's not tailored to the

728
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,080
level of resources you have or the point

729
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
that you're at in your journey of

730
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,720
maturity

731
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,440
and so we heard organizations say it's

732
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,679
just overwhelming they have analysis

733
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,120
paralysis they don't know where they get

734
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
started we say to people you should

735
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,679
patch you should segment your network

736
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,039
you should have identity access

737
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,039
management where's your email filtering

738
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,880
what are you doing for user awareness

739
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
and we talk about it as if that's a

740
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
monday morning for people

741
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
have any of you done that in a single

742
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
morning just out of interest

743
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,279
no

744
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
okay so

745
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,559
one of the things that we heard a

746
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,600
request for a lot was to have a much

747
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,200
more sort of single source of truth on

748
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,159
uh on ransomware something like the nist

749
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
framework or if you prefer the iso

750
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
reference the the iso framework that

751
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
would be adaptable for people and it

752
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,039
would create a path to maturity and you

753
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,679
could have profiles applied to it

754
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
so response to this nist created a

755
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,039
profile for the cyber security framework

756
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,840
um

757
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
i can totally understand why they took

758
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,919
this approach because this view is this

759
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
is defense in depth it's not different

760
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,760
to a standard defense and depth program

761
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
just because there's an emphasis on

762
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,600
backups it's still defense in depth and

763
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
we have a framework for that so why

764
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,200
create a new framework instead let's

765
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,960
apply a profile

766
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
that rationale doesn't seem bad to me

767
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
but the the feedback that i have heard

768
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,640
from people is that they still feel that

769
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
this

770
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,279
doesn't quite get them where they want

771
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
to go

772
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,360
um

773
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
a lot of governments have also taken a

774
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
step of creating a sort of one-stop shop

775
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,520
for information so scissor has a website

776
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,200
called stop ransomware um and it's you

777
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,960
know it's worth checking out those kinds

778
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,799
of resources as well if you're looking

779
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,400
for solutions here

780
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
no more ransom also has a lot of

781
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,039
resources available for people

782
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,720
so that's it i'm now going to stop

783
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,840
talking

784
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,640
um here's the the the place to go if you

785
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
want to look at the full report and read

786
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,520
all uh 48 recommendations um it is the

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
link the link is that's not the full

788
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
link obviously but it's very easy to

789
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
find on that website um and if you have

790
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
questions about it i'd be happy to

791
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,279
answer them although i think we're out

792
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,360
of time for right now but i'll be i'll

793
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
be around um oh okay well we have three

794
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
minutes so if anyone has a question for

795
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
me let's go

796
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,480
yes oh mr honan

797
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,520
i really hoped you weren't going to ask

798
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,880
me that

799
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
so for those who didn't hear the

800
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
question was did ireland participate in

801
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
an official capacity

802
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,879
uh not to the best of my knowledge

803
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,840
sorry

804
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
but but if but if the irish government

805
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
would like to talk to us we'd be super

806
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,918
happy to talk to them

807
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,678
um any other questions

808
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,320
yep

809
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,120
[Music]

810
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,919
yeah we did talk about it um so the

811
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,039
question was

812
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,399
did we think about the role of cyber

813
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,640
insurance companies um

814
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,120
one of my fellow co-chairs was from a

815
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,760
cyber insurance company um and i think

816
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,440
it would be fair to say that we started

817
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
the process very far away from each

818
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,640
other um and i was probably more

819
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,799
accusatory than i should have been

820
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,840
um

821
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,559
and he handled it with good grace um

822
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,279
i

823
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,440
h here's the thing that i learned

824
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
through the process of interviewing an

825
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
awful lot of organizations um some

826
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
basics one

827
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,679
not all insurance companies are made the

828
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,399
same it's a really really complex market

829
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,640
with a lot of variety in terms of

830
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,240
approach and attitude

831
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,120
um

832
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,559
two

833
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,399
if you are looking at organizations at

834
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,600
the lower end of the market if you're

835
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,159
looking at small businesses who have

836
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,399
no real path to resilience cyber

837
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
insurance is often what they have it's

838
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
it's that or nothing and if you take

839
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
that away from them or if you mandate

840
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,320
insurers

841
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,080
to um require a security baseline then

842
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,640
those small businesses lose any sense of

843
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,720
resilience at all and it's not

844
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,240
you can't simply say

845
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,919
well you need to go take preventative

846
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,840
measures because they just don't have

847
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,320
the capacity or the resources to do it

848
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,559
um

849
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,880
that said

850
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
i definitely feel the frustration that

851
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,840
others have shared

852
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,559
around um the fact that insurers

853
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,240
have

854
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,279
at times pushed organizations to pay

855
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,200
and have on staff negotiators as a

856
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
default position and sometimes won't

857
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,679
cover for recovery but will recover for

858
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,720
paying

859
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,799
and i think that's a problem and i do i

860
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,240
think we need to look into that a little

861
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,240
bit more what i can say is at the

862
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
the bigger insurance companies that sort

863
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
of lead the market and have the market

864
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,200
share

865
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,559
are losing money

866
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,120
like handover fists losing money and so

867
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
they are now changing their strategy and

868
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
they are now making requirements for

869
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
security program as part of their policy

870
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
the problem is

871
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
that the industry is built up of these

872
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,039
big guys and then there's like a very

873
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,679
long tail of very small guys who because

874
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,440
what they want is just to get market

875
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,480
share

876
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
they will use it as a usp that they

877
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,320
don't require a baseline

878
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,200
so

879
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
it's tough the other thing that i got

880
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
told pretty consistently was the way

881
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,360
that insurance works is

882
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,919
if you um

883
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
if you

884
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,240
uh legislate in the uk

885
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,760
then they'll move the policies to

886
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,679
switzerland or to the us so you'd have

887
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,200
to get all the countries concerned to

888
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,399
legislate in the same way at the same

889
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,679
time

890
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,600
and now i'm out of time thank you very

891
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,799
much i really appreciate your time
