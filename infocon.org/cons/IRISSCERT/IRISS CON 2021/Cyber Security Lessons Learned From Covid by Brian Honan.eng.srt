8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,439
security center here and he and his team

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,279

the uh

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,280
the stress and the hard work that

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,480
they've put in

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,719
uh not just before they're at the hcc

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,480
ransomware attack but other issues

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
journey and they're they're doing a

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,840
stellar job and uh thank you very much

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
for everything you do

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
so

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
pardon the the slide uh the slides i

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,400
actually put this together on my iphone

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,040
so uh it shows you the technology has

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
has has moved on so i just taught today

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
uh because trust me one of the most

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,080
stressful things you can do is try and

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
organize an in-person conference

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
during covert when the numbers are

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
rising and the government keeps changing

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,960
the guidelines and you're trying to

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,799
organize people from many different

42
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
areas to come so uh i just thought maybe

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,159
using the team i've covered and tying it

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,560
in might be uh of interest

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,360
so

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
you've all heard about ransomware and uh

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
you know i'm not going to go on but too

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
too much it's it's it's it's there

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
before and we've seen the different

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,079
uh

51
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
ransomware attacks that happened uh

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,720
you know at the cert our research we're

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
seeing uh victims happening with it and

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
our own company bh consulting we've

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,520
helped

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
several companies recover but i think

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
the major attacks that we've talked

58
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,719
about we've heard about the hse attack

59
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,960
the colonial pipeline attack they are

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
happening they're becoming more regular

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,640
but they are still relatively rare

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
events and it's it's going to reinforce

63
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,399
what

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,878
victoria was saying earlier on and kiron

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,800
we do have to change this language i

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
think the language we use in cyber

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,959
security is too miraturistic it's too

68
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,680
macho it's too much you know

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
we're it's it's we're using phrases like

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
the dmz and red teaming and stuff like

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
that you know like

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
we're qa in a system that hasn't been

73
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,879
developed properly that's what we're

74
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,160
doing

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
you know i know it doesn't sound

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
exciting but that's what it is

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
and you don't if you take a parallel

78
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
cyber security into

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
physical security you don't hear people

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
in the physical security trade talking

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
about uh

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
military phrases and a lot of stuff they

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,959
talk about shoplifters and they talk

84
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
about you know break-ins they don't talk

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
about it was a sophisticated cyber

86
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
attack hands up here who

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,000
has experienced as a sophisticated cyber

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
attack

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,800
a real sophisticated cyber institute so

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
yeah now

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,640
i know the two people put their hands up

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
and i know they have because of the

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,239
areas they're working

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
but if there's a breach tomorrow what's

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
the press release going to say

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
it was a sophisticated cyber security

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
attack so we do need to change the

98
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
language and we do have to remember we

99
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
do need to stop scaring people we need

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
to assure people we need to build

101
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
resilience in so

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,920
some of the lessons we can learn from

103
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,319
covet and how we can defend and respond

104
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,000
so this is very much tongue-in-cheek

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,480
folks it's just to to you know stand in

106
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
for for richard not being able to speak

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
but we need to look at how we defend our

108
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,879
systems but more importantly how we

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,200
respond and i often say to people

110
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
what you put in place to defend or

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,480
secure your network won't stop the

112
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
attackers

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
it will delay the attackers

114
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
a sophisticated attacker will get by

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
your systems eventually so what you need

116
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,959
to do is design your security that you

117
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
delay them long enough that you detect

118
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
them so that you can respond and kick

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,799
them back out again and that's what we

120
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
need to need to be looking at

121
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
so first thing you do if you all

122
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
remember at the start of covet we were

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
looking for toilet rolls we were looking

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
for

125
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
hand sanitizers and you couldn't get

126
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
them so identify what are your key

127
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,120
assets what is it that you want to

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
protect what that you need best okay so

129
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,478
what's your precious

130
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,959
well what is it that you need

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
you need to keep safe

132
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
make sure you've got a good effective

133
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
patch management place that you've got

134
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
good cyber security hygiene in place

135
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
that you're keeping everything nice and

136
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
and and secure as can be

137
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
uh

138
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
have good effective antivirus in place

139
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
so i'm sure you just be quite happy to

140
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
to talk to anybody who wants to talk to

141
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,040
kaspersky about any of their products

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
and bob from trend will likewise uh chat

143
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,560
way to any of you as well but have good

144
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,639
effective anti-virus products in place

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
there are several

146
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
issues that we've responded to and help

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
clients

148
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
react to and

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
they haven't had effective antivirus

150
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
solutions in place and if they had they

151
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
wouldn't have they wouldn't have had the

152
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
issue

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
in the in the first

154
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,039
place keep good user engagement if you

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
look i know we criticize the government

156
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
because it's the easy thing to do

157
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
but in fairness if you do look at the

158
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
government and the messages they've been

159
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
given out about covert 19 but what we

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
should be doing social discipline

161
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,960
washing hands wear masks

162
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
get vaccinated there are messages that

163
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,199
are being repeated over and over again

164
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
there's very few people in this country

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
that that at this stage don't know what

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
they should be doing with regards to

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
covert 19. can you say the same about

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,039
your user base and your organization

169
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
when it comes to cyber security does

170
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,360
everybody in your organization know how

171
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,680
to act in a secure manner in a secure

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
way so a good effective communication

173
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
again using simple language

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
not to scare the users and keep

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
keep them going and if you do have a

176
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,759
breach

177
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
have very good effective communication

178
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,800
as well

179
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
so if you look at uh coming back to the

180
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
hs to the hsc ransomware attack that guy

181
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
is that what triggered thursday night or

182
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,639
something wasn't it it was a terrorist

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,440
night

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,479
seven o'clock friday morning paul reed

185
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,400
the ceo of the hse was on morning

186
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
ireland

187
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,720
explaining exactly what was going on

188
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
we all knew what was happening tech we

189
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
knew what the impact was we knew what

190
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
was going to happen and we knew the

191
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
government wasn't going to pay the

192
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,440
ransom it was very clear communications

193
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
we have there's a similar ransomware

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
attack currently happening new in

195
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,960
newfoundland and labrador and canada

196
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
and all that our government is doing

197
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
we've had a cyber a a cyber attack and

198
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
we're investigating it now

199
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
if it looks like a dog a walks like a

200
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
dog and it barks like a dog it's a dog

201
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
name it as such you know but they're

202
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,639
refusing to and

203
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
you can see the the confusion in the in

204
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
in the media about what's going on and

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
unclear so make sure you've got good

206
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,240
clear uh communications at all not just

207
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
at user engagement but if you're

208
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,720
managing a a breach as well

209
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,520
have good filtering in place so you know

210
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
your mass filters out the bad stuff

211
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
coming out of your mouth and bad stuff

212
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
that that could be coming into your uh

213
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,720
airways from from other people have good

214
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,039
effective filtering at your

215
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,240
end endpoints

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,479
uh at your perimeter be the email

217
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,800
filtering be that web filtering endpoint

218
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,919
filtering and there are some very good

219
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
sponsors out there who will be very

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,360
happy to talk to i'm sure about some of

221
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,280
the solutions that they that they have

222
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
in place

223
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
harden your systems

224
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
lock them down

225
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
people should not have local admin

226
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
access on their computers

227
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
i don't care what operating system

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
you're running if if the person has

229
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,039
local admin access on their system and

230
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
they click on a link under attachment

231
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
that machine is going to be compromised

232
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
it doesn't matter what it is windows 7 i

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
don't care windows 10 is going to happen

234
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,599
with that as well so lock down your

235
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,240
systems restrict access and keep them to

236
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
keep them secure

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
have good segmentation in your networks

238
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
i know that's easy to say was very hard

239
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
to implement particularly as many

240
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,919
organizations environments have evolved

241
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
over time

242
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,199
we have uh

243
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,199
we

244
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
we have a client now with bh consulting

245
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
that i used to work with way way back in

246
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
my formative days and they're still you

247
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,280
they're still using the same

248
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,199
uh server naming structure i put in

249
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
place was really it was really weird

250
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,800
walking in you know oh whoa i remember

251
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
that serving that's not the same machine

252
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
thankfully but

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,279
it's the same naming convention you know

254
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,159
but

255
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
i think any organization here

256
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,399
won't be able to put their hand on heart

257
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,000
and say they've got good segmentation in

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
place because it just has evolved over

259
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
time networks have been thrown in but

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
it's time to look at that we need to go

261
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
back to segmentation look at how we can

262
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,279
isolate systems so that as eugene in in

263
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,120
in his presentation did with the prison

264
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,519
cells if you keep the bad things in

265
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
place you can lock it down if

266
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
one part of your environment gets

267
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
compromised you can lock it down and the

268
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
whole environment doesn't get

269
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
compromised so have good effective

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
segmentation in place

271
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
have your appropriate instant response

272
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
the best time to do your instant

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
response planning

274
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
is now well it's after maybe tomorrow

275
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
okay but it's it's it's not during your

276
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
res during an instant

277
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,760
it's not that's let's ring a cyber

278
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,440
security company or let's bring the

279
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
cyber insurance company what do we do do

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
your planning now and coming back to the

281
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
example of paul reeve the hse have good

282
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
effective communications have your

283
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,399
effect crisis plan ready your crisis

284
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
message is ready so go through the

285
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
different scenarios you may be a victim

286
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
of have you got a press statement ready

287
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
right now if you get hit by ransomware

288
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
have you got one if you can hit by buy a

289
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
ddos or a debasement

290
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,720
because what you don't want to happen

291
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
then is in the middle of an attack if

292
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
somebody writing the the statement has

293
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
to go to pr to be to to be reviewed now

294
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
it also has to go to legal

295
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,680
you know in the meantime you've got

296
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
reporters and people and stakeholders

297
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,519
ringing up saying what's going on

298
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
so have your crisis communications plans

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,079
up and ready have your instant response

300
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
plans ready have the people who are part

301
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,640
of that team trained and know what

302
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,160
they're going to do and have the tools

303
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,399
they want and do regular exercises to

304
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,480
make sure it works

305
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
try and figure out if you have a breach

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
at eight o'clock on a friday morning

307
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
during this

308
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
during the school term are the key

309
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
people on your team available are they

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
in the middle of the school run or is it

311
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
10 o'clock on a friday night are they in

312
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
the pub somewhere

313
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
or are well probably not anymore but

314
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
then definitely won't be after midnight

315
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
but are they available you know are they

316
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,640
available at those different times

317
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
because you know what

318
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
the hackers don't care what time they

319
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,640
get into your system and that

320
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
they will try and and they work their

321
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
own time lines as well as eugene said

322
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
some of them are chinese speaking so

323
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,839
guess what while we're asleep china's

324
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,959
awake so you could get a phone call at

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,079
two o'clock in the mornings and you got

326
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
a breach can you get your team together

327
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
to respond at that stage

328
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,399
look at ways you can detect anonymities

329
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
and look at indicators of compromise in

330
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
your in your in your environment is

331
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,279
there anything happening in your

332
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,360
environment that could that is unusual

333
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
that could indicate you've been

334
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,160
compromised is it unusual network

335
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
traffic is somebody logging in from

336
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,079
china at two o'clock in the morning on a

337
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,600
sunday night when they should be logging

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
in from dublin

339
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,079
yeah so where where are there any

340
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
unusual patterns like that you will get

341
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
great threat fees from many of the of

342
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,079
the vendors there's lots of good open

343
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,839
source tread feeds if if you're looking

344
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,839
for one a lot the search we we use it's

345
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,880
called nisp it's open source it's free i

346
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,320
know the ncc uses uh many starts to use

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
it you get lots of threat intelligence

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,360
and that that you can then use to feed

349
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
into your seam or your defenses to

350
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,399
identify if if there's any compromise in

351
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
your network as it is so do be looking

352
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
for on you know anonymities or

353
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,560
unusual behaviors

354
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,480
manage your network traffic

355
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,440
you know

356
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
make sure traffic is going where it

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,560
should be going

358
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,320
hands up how many of you monitor your

359
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
dns logs

360
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,560
it's funny one of the people who got hit

361
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
by a sophisticated attack also monitored

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
the day nasa i want is there a

363
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,130
connection but anyway

364
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,639
[Laughter]

365
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
your dns logs will tell you exactly what

366
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
your network is doing where it's

367
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
communicating and what's happening

368
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,600
is there's ftp traffic going to a server

369
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
in kazakhstan somewhere

370
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
and if there is should it be going there

371
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
you know have you got dns calls going to

372
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
ip addresses on this coming back to your

373
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,279
trend and tell if you've got trent until

374
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
none of those bad ip addresses out on

375
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,160
the internet

376
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
have you checked your dns logs to see if

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,519
you any devices communicate with those

378
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,920
bad ip addresses your dns files can

379
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
provide you with a huge amount of great

380
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
intel and

381
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
insight into how your network is working

382
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
uh on behaving and if it's been

383
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
compromised so look at ways of managing

384
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480
your network traffic to keep it secure

385
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
when you do get hit look at ways to

386
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
isolate our uh vulnerable or infected

387
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
systems

388
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
see how you can you know how can you

389
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,360
keep you know coming back to the

390
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
segmentation you know do you unplug the

391
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,680
device do you turn it off can you cut

392
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
off part the network

393
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,560
because

394
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
it's going to take a while to you know

395
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
you need to make sure you don't infect

396
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
the rest of your environment or rest of

397
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,040
your systems at all so it's it's

398
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,440
important that you have ways of of

399
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
isolating those environments when when

400
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
they do happen

401
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
uh

402
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,000
sorry there's something through my mind

403
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
there when i was

404
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,320
going through that this is great you

405
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
know when you don't prepare prepare for

406
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,120
your talk you've got great ideas and you

407
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
go oh shoot i forgot that you know but

408
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,760
anyway sorry excuse me so look at ways

409
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
you can isolate your vulnerable our uh

410
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
our or infected systems uh and that

411
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
could be virtually it could be

412
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
physically uh

413
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
what whatever way it may be

414
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,560
make sure

415
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
on it all comes back to again what karen

416
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
was talking about and victoria what

417
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,600
resilience have you got in place

418
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
if you get hit by a ransomware attack

419
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
tomorrow

420
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,560
can your organization stay in business

421
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,199
can they keep operating

422
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,519
you look at the hsc they had to go back

423
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
to pen and paper

424
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
and there was huge amount of of work and

425
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,839
stress on on the medical environment put

426
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,040
put on that

427
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,519
norse hydro and norwegian aluminium

428
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,279
smelting plant

429
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
got hit by ransomware and actually they

430
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,399
they

431
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
are a great example of how to do instant

432
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,600
response properly do google it they had

433
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,199
regular press conferences they had them

434
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
up on youtube and they talked through

435
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,639
exactly how they respond to the

436
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,800
ransomware attack now i didn't know

437
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,760
until i read about uh norse hydro that

438
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
if you've got an aluminium smelting

439
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,480
plant

440
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
you can never turn that plant off

441
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
because if you turn it off the aluminium

442
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,839
hardens and your whole plant is useless

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
you may as well just throw it out

444
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,120
so their their contingency was

445
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
getting the retired guys and take down

446
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
the old the old

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
paper based instructions on how to keep

448
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
the plant going

449
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,240
do you have that in place

450
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,399
you know so do you have system surveys

451
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
etc to communicate

452
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,120
with people so have your business

453
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
resilience your instant response and

454
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
your business continue in place

455
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,199
i would suggest

456
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
talk to your business continuity people

457
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
and bring cyber security scenarios into

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,839
them as part of their

459
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,639
bcp planning

460
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
and of course when the patches are

461
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,440
available

462
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
apply them

463
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
you know

464
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,839
uh this week was kind of uh

465
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,519
uh and

466
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,040
suppose a strange week for me because

467
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
obviously being you know i do have a a

468
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
son who's uh who will be deemed to be

469
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
very very vulnerable so we're very

470
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,560
cautious about how we've been behaving

471
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
with covert so i've been actually

472
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,759
waiting when's the booster come on

473
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,199
when's the booster coming and then it's

474
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,480
announced

475
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
boosters are available for those over 50

476
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,759
and i've got yes over 50 oh i'm

477
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,079
over 50.

478
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,000
but when it's available

479
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
take it you know the patches are

480
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,160
available apply them

481
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
when they are

482
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
and then looks at ways how do you get

483
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
your business back in line again you

484
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,959
know so you've been hit by the attack or

485
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,880
you've been hit by the the incident

486
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,959
you've recovered your systems how do you

487
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
get back to business restoration

488
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,079
and i

489
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,440
i was going to use the phrase phrase a

490
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
key thing but it's kind of wrong to use

491
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
but a message i've been trying to

492
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
strongly give out over the past few

493
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
months and you know picking on maybe on

494
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
the back of the hse attack

495
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
they took the right stance in my view of

496
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
not paying the ransom now they did get

497
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
the key at the end of the day but the

498
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
key is not some magic pixie dust that

499
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
you can wave over your your compromised

500
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
systems and have them back up and

501
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,880
running with the very next day

502
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,839
you still have to manually go and check

503
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
every individual system to verify it is

504
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,800
not compromised because the last thing

505
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
you want to do is recover from your

506
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,640
ransomware attack turn your computer

507
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,919
back on again

508
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
not address any of the vulnerabilities

509
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,319
or uh check for any compromise uh on the

510
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
device and whammo you're hit again

511
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,160
you know so

512
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,359
just because you

513
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
you know just because you get the the

514
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
ransomware key is no guarantee you're

515
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
going to recover your systems in a quick

516
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,240
efficient way it can take longer colony

517
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,960
pipeline paid 4.4 million dollars for

518
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
for their for the recovery key from the

519
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
the attackers they end up using their

520
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
own backups anyway because the

521
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,080
ransomware key was badly written

522
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,720
some of these you know these keys

523
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
it's not exactly as if you've got a uat

524
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
environment you can test them on to make

525
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,320
sure they work for each individual

526
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
customer so you've got no guarantee

527
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,559
they're going to work from these

528
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,160
criminals and anyway you're dealing with

529
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
criminals how much do you trust a

530
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
criminal

531
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
yeah so

532
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
you get rebuilt get get to rebuild you

533
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
know so

534
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,360
do uh look look around even

535
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,760
with the hc there are still a percentage

536
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
of their environment

537
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
six months after the attack

538
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,039
that have not been recovered yet because

539
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
it takes it's very time consuming and

540
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
takes a lot of work

541
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
so with that that's my quick talk

542
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
through of lessons we can apply to cyber

543
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,960
security from uh covert 19. how are we

544
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,919
doing for for time tom yeah

545
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,200
have memories any questions i'm quite

546
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
happy to take them

547
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
not really a question of your comment

548
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,080
you were talking about patching and

549
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
everything

550
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
i'd add

551
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
check double check and triple check just

552
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
because machines are being patched

553
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
doesn't mean they're actually patched or

554
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
not patching everything so you need to

555
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,320
have a place you don't need to have in

556
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
place a some kind of compliance

557
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,600
dashboard or some kind of tracking

558
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
dashboard or some kind of way to double

559
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
check that you're actually doing it for

560
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,000
example if you're using duo or octa and

561
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
things like that you can actually check

562
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
when a machine is logging in

563
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,400
but it's actually patched and it has the

564
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
right patches in place all banned from

565
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,840
being blocked

566
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,679
so you need to keep that in mind as well

567
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,039
just do the actions you need to check

568
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
that the actions are done yeah

569
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,679
yep

570
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,120
so just for the the video and and those

571
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,559
who probably didn't hear schneiderlin is

572
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
to say that there are people you know

573
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,280
your your anti-virus dashboard might

574
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
show that you've got 100 compliance and

575
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,320
100 uh up-to-date but have you got 100

576
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,000
of your devices with antivirus software

577
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,960
on them

578
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
so yeah we're 100 covered but only in

579
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,320
the devices that the antivirus software

580
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
installed so there could be other other

581
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,360
devices there

582
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
yeah

583
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
sorry

584
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
a few businesses in yeah

585
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,679
have

586
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
most of the work for postpartum hotel

587
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
as you know like i'm a beautiful section

588
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,200
of privacy so i see a lot of policies

589
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,760
coming through on home security and

590
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,320
checking seriously

591
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,799
is

592
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
the point is that uh with cover 19 lots

593
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
of people are now working from home

594
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
how can we as organizations ensure that

595
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
the privacy of the the remote workers

596
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,480
that any of the

597
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,720
uh security systems we put in place

598
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
don't be intrude on their privacy or

599
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,360
others in in in the home but also how

600
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
can we manage cyber security in a way

601
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
and i think that's a that's a very good

602
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,280
point i think we're seeing a lot of uh

603
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
our clients having to maybe look at

604
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
mobile device management uh solutions

605
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,240
because

606
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,679
uh

607
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,400
there are many companies who had staff

608
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
working remotely but not every company

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
had a laptop for every member of staff

610
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
so you've got people working from their

611
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,400
own personal devices uh potentially so

612
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
having a mobile device management

613
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,200
platform or maybe you can have uh

614
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,679
virtual machines or

615
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,919
isolated environments on those devices

616
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,760
where you can have the corporate

617
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
stuff running and they came to keep the

618
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,039
person

619
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
separate that would be something i'd be

620
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,240
looking at but there is going to be a

621
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,200
cost

622
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
but

623
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
you know at the end of the day

624
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
we as organizations

625
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,760
we as a country

626
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,559
have underinvested an under-resourced

627
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,159
cyber security so we are reaping

628
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,240
the seeds of what has well there hasn't

629
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
been that many seeds sown so we you know

630
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
we are paying the price for not

631
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,679
investing properly in cyber security

632
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,480
so uh if companies do not want to

633
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,039
operate in this this model because you

634
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,799
know if you support remote working you

635
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,600
may be

636
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
saving costs elsewhere

637
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
so that's that that's potential way to

638
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,840
work workers

639
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,559
yep uh

640
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,880
so brian the uh you can understand maybe

641
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,039
why some companies use

642
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,600
sophisticated cyber attacks

643
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,399
say our idiot boss enable content

644
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,200
yeah so the question is you can

645
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,120
understand why some companies use a

646
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,760
sophisticated attack uh because it

647
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,840
doesn't make them sound bad

648
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
you know maybe the boss clicked on an

649
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
enable contact or a link

650
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
i think the big problem we have in cyber

651
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
security it comes back to the language

652
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
we use and it comes back to the culture

653
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
we've had in the industry is that we're

654
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,200
very full of bravado and macho and

655
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
machismo and and all that

656
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
that rubbish

657
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
and we have been too quick to victim

658
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
blame

659
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
i if i walk out of the stadium tonight

660
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,880
welcome back to my hotel and i get

661
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,840
mugged

662
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,520
who's to blame for me getting mugged

663
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,760
am i to blame

664
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,200
hse got hacked now we do not know yet

665
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
how the hse got hacked or what caused

666
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
the ransomware attack

667
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,039
i've seen lots of commentary oh it's

668
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
because it runs windows 7 no one they

669
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
got they got breached or or it was a an

670
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,559
email or it was through remote gateways

671
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,400
we don't know yet

672
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,440
but

673
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
really does it really matter

674
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,679
they were victims of an attack the

675
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,840
criminals are the ones responsible and

676
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,520
that's where we need to focus our stuff

677
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,600
and until we start doing that we are

678
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,760
going to have this

679
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
language being used by companies as a

680
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,799
get out clause to sort of like don't

681
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,640
blame us it wasn't our fault it was a it

682
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
was a sophisticated attack

683
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
you know like

684
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,120
i'm not probably going to use a bad

685
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
analogy here but i'm actually trying to

686
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,279
think

687
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,080
bank robberies i've never heard

688
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,440
you know bank robberies in the real

689
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
world i've never heard the news gone it

690
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,640
was a sophisticated bank robber

691
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
you know it was it's a bank you know

692
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,039
it's it they don't talk about

693
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,600
sophisticated crime very often in the

694
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
real world why are we doing it in cyber

695
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,799
security

696
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,679
it says fear

697
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
that's that's that that's my concern so

698
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,880
uh

699
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
unless there's one any one last question

700
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
because

701
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
what's two last questions okay sorry

702
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,799
would take this german here and then

703
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
then that gentleman and then i have to

704
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
finish up for the because if you want to

705
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,440
have lunch we have to finish up some

706
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
stage folks sorry and i'm only meant to

707
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,160
fill in

708
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,679
[Laughter]

709
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,159
sorry go ahead

710
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
no we don't and and anybody telling you

711
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,799
to know why is is just speculating i've

712
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,279
been asked why and i all i speculate is

713
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,159
because

714
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,960
uh in my opinion and i'm based on this

715
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,440
on no fact or any other knowledge in my

716
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,320
opinion when when when you hack

717
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
and hold a company to ransom you're

718
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,600
dealing with the directors of a company

719
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
and they're dealing it's a business

720
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,480
transaction

721
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
you hack a government it's a whole

722
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,840
different world it's a different

723
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,679
ballgame right so when the government

724
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,360
turns around say we are not negotiating

725
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
with you to get the key back you know

726
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,840
that game has been lost

727
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,400
so in my opinion they

728
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
made the key available

729
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
to push the pressure on the government

730
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,279
to stop the data being released

731
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,520
so you know we're not that bad criminals

732
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,360
look we gave you the ransom the the key

733
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
to get your information back we're not

734
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,320
all bad and if he pays the money we

735
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,600
won't release the date on the internet

736
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,360
now they didn't do that in the end

737
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
either that we know of but that's the

738
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
only reason that's one

739
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
and i could be absolutely wrong uh it

740
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,279
won't be the first time and it won't be

741
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,880
the last time

742
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,760
sorry last question then

743
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,520
yeah it's a good question so have we as

744
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,159
a society and and business underestimate

745
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,240
the downside of cyber attacks and the

746
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
impact it could have on us i think we

747
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,400
actually

748
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
we have because

749
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,440
and

750
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,159
i think the problem we have is that i t

751
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,720
as an industry is only

752
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
about 40 50 years old

753
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,360
cyber security is is only 10 15 20 years

754
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,159
old

755
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,559
so we haven't got the disciplines in in

756
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,600
place like the savior to risk management

757
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
in cyber security was meant to be the

758
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
insurance companies yeah insurance

759
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,320
companies they know all about risk they

760
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
can teach us how to do risk

761
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,559
insurance companies went

762
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,080
how much is the ransom and how much is

763
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,919
to recover ransom is cheaper pay the

764
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,080
ransom and what what behavior is that

765
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
generated

766
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,279
cyberlogy respect anybody from insurance

767
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,600
companies in the audience sorry but

768
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,400
i would argue that that behavior has

769
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
encouraged the criminals to to to behave

770
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
that way there is an interview of uh i

771
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,799
can't remember the the ransomware gang

772
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
where uh they're interviewed by uh one

773
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
of the security magazines and they're

774
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,360
asked how do you pick

775
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
companies to target and they said we

776
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
target companies that got to have cyber

777
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
insurance because we know this cyber

778
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,960
insurance companies will pay up

779
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,039
so the next question was well how do you

780
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,679
know which companies are cyber insurance

781
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,200
and the answer was because we have we've

782
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,559
hacked the cyber insurance companies we

783
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,960
have their customer list

784
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
so look we do need to get better at

785
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,279
understand understanding the risk

786
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,520
understanding the impact of the risk i'm

787
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
managing that risk much better so look

788
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
i'm held up way too long now but thank

789
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,240
you very much
