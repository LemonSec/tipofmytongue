1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,560
morning everyone well this is lovely

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,759
isn't it

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,800
um and this

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,679
well what is this exactly

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
any ideas shout out through your mosque

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
if you think you know what this might be

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,279
oh almost stripping the gender away

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
but that's a bit techy for me sorry um

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,519
it's a shameless plug everybody

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,000
[Laughter]

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and so is this actually this is also a

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
shameless plug um there were certain

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
things which like you i did a lot more

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
of during lockdown uh firstly i had far

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,879
too many crisps

16
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,600
um and i'm gonna not talk too much about

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,520
chris because i'm conscious that we do

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,239
have some crisp aficionados in the

19
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,800
audience and when when kieran arrives i

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
will defer to him on specialist crisp

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
and specifically tato knowledge and i

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
also watch far too many cop dramas old

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
70s cop dramas being my favorite um so

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
particularly the sweeney

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
shout it and that kind of thing and the

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,000
professionals which as an ex

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
intelligence analyst i'm particularly

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
partial to that's exactly how

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
intelligence analysis works in law

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
enforcement by the way in case you were

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,759
wondering

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
um but i also like all of you decided to

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,439
use the time to write a book

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,320
and my full confessional which is kind

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
of in the book the tell-all

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
is that my background isn't in

37
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,439
information security or cyber at all i

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
read classics at university my phd

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
is in roman rhetoric in satire that is 2

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,240
000 years old

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
so political rhetoric which kind of

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
comes in handy

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,000
when you look at how governments and

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
vendors and there will be a little bit

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,479
of

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,479
vendor analysis here and criminals even

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,000
represent security issues so i went all

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
the way back to my heritage i started

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
with the emperor augustus

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,760
round about

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,879
zero bce

52
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
talking about all of his achievements

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
what he managed to do in his foreign

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
policy how he protected the empire from

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
external threats i looked at the us

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
national security strategy so think

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
about george w bush and his war on

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
terror

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,599
right and the presidents they write

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
prefaces describing what they're going

61
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,480
to do

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
with their security for the coming years

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
i looked at online harm's rhetoric so

64
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,680
the panic that we can induce in people

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
when we tell them that for instance

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
online grooming's going up that children

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,040
are at risk

68
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,480
and i looked at cyber security and

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
something shocked me

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
what shocked me when i looked at cyber

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,120
was that criminals

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,959
governments and that includes law

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
enforcement agencies

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,840
and

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,000
vendors have a tendency to represent

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
cyber threats in exactly the same way

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
which is kind of weird when you think

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,280
about that

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,200
so there is we have to be honest a

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
certain amount of amplification

81
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
threat inflation

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
tapping into the fear aspect of fear

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,280
uncertainty and doubt there are notable

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
exceptions there are some great

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
exceptions and we see the tide turning a

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,519
little bit on representing these issues

87
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
as amplified but

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
in rhetorical terms in literary terms

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,599
what we're actually talking about is

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
hyperbole so ramping up the threat to

91
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
make it seem sometimes

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
bigger than it is

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
and that's not for a second

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,239
to say that i don't think cyber threats

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
are serious and that

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
you know they don't include threats to

97
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
national security and critical

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
infrastructure they absolutely do but

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
what i'd like you to do just for the

100
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,639
next few minutes

101
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
is a bit of make-believe pretend

102
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
that you are not

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,560
an information security specialist

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
pretend that you are the ordinary punter

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
in the street

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
who has a family who runs a business and

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,479
they want to know how to protect

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
themselves they want to know how to

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,479
prevent

110
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,840
cyber crime and attacks on them their

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,160
loved ones and their businesses

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
and so we're going to do that through a

113
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
little test and a basic search if you

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
like

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
what we also do and as someone who used

116
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,960
to write threat assessments on

117
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
cybercrime i'm pretty certain i've done

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
this as well so you know i'm i'm with

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,639
you all here

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,880
is we make it seem more immediate we

121
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,199
make it seem urgent

122
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,720
so if you think about

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
a phishing email

124
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
you must click now

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
you know or it's extortion email i've

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
seen you do something pretty disgusting

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,039
you need to go here and pay me some

128
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,520
bitcoin the ransomware pop-up screen

129
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
says you have to do something right now

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
the vendor

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,440
website that says secure your everything

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
etc

133
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
how we do that in our language how

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
that's reflected in our communications

135
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
the language but also the visuals is

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
through metaphors

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,919
and with metaphors it's about taking

138
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,600
something that's really abstract like

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
cybercrime like cyber threats like zeros

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
and ones and turning it into something

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
that ordinary people can relate to that

142
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,639
in itself is laudable because we need to

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,960
land the message

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
but perhaps some of the metaphors we're

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
using are not necessarily appropriate

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
and they're not necessarily going to be

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,319
effective so we're also going to look

148
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
very very briefly at what some of the

149
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
alternatives might be just because

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,120
we've been doing fud all this time

151
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
doesn't mean we have to stick with it

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,359
there could be other ways of doing this

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
so i thought to myself what's the best

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
way

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
to work out

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,840
what people are being fed in terms of

157
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
language and images

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
um and of course we've got google images

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,800
for that so this is what you get when

160
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
you search for cyber crime prevention

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,199
advice

162
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,520
on google images so what are we seeing

163
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,800
here we're seeing a bit of a common

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,960
theme aren't we we're seeing blue light

165
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,360
csi cyber

166
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
we're seeing faceless hackers in hoodies

167
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
okay so it's all a little bit inhuman

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
um what else are we saying we're seeing

169
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,120
things that you are barred out of crime

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
scene tape

171
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,039
padlocks not for you not for you

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,720
ordinary people unless you can

173
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
understand the cascading zeros and ones

174
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
and the code that's running across the

175
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
screen this is not for you

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
okay so it's quite exclusive it's quite

177
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,599
prohibitive and one of those images

178
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,360
i always do this i always point at the

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
screen it's not there you know

180
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
um is this one

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,000
which is which for four years i think

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
was the welcome image on the fbi cyber

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
crime prevention website

184
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,880
so

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,080
so what have we got we've got um

186
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
sorry to use this term so early in the

187
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,680
morning but with the rapacious hands

188
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
and the global background we've

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
basically got mr global rapist

190
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
going oh i'm a magician i'm magicking up

191
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,080
numbers and here's the cascading binary

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
you won't understand that this is not

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
for you

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,360
okay

195
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
now we're used to this aren't we we're

196
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,080
so

197
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
inured desensitized

198
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
to this imagery

199
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
but i suspect that for a certain age

200
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,120
group when you look at someone who

201
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,840
is faceless and wearing a hood and

202
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
coming to get you

203
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
actually it will make them think of this

204
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
and one thing we know about the grim

205
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,039
reaper with some exceptions

206
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,440
very few exceptions that i'm very happy

207
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
to sing you later

208
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
in traditional english and european folk

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,559
song you don't get to cheat this guy

210
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,919
you are powerless if he's coming for you

211
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
there is absolutely nothing you can do

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
about it

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,399
you don't even know what he looks like

214
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,320
okay so this for me

215
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
if i'm thinking myself into the position

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,160
of someone who isn't a cyber or infosec

217
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,399
specialist who doesn't work on this

218
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
stuff all the time who isn't

219
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,640
desensitized

220
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,880
is that cyber is pointless trying to get

221
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
your head around because there's nothing

222
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,200
you can do about it

223
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
now there is some text

224
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
underneath this image so if you can get

225
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,920
past the image there's a certain amount

226
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
of information

227
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,399
and

228
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
i've got a script here to read make sure

229
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
i represent it to you accurately i don't

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
want to misrepresent

231
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,839
but what we're going to do we're going

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,120
to follow the same principle we're going

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,640
to use images from google images

234
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,519
for

235
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
the metaphors that are used

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,279
in this text you'll see what i mean

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
okay the fbi says

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,880
the collective impact of computer and

239
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
network intrusions

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
is staggering

241
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
billions of dollars are lost every year

242
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,279
repairing systems hit by such attacks

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,720
ransomware

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
is insidious and the inability to access

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,600
important data can be catastrophic in

246
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
terms of the loss of sensitive or

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,839
proprietary information the disruption

248
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,640
to regular operations financial losses

249
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,200
incurred to restore systems and files

250
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
and the potential harm to an

251
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
organization's reputation now this

252
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,880
depends very much on your particular

253
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
favorite flavor of catastrophe whether

254
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
it's man-made or whether it's natural um

255
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
the fbi continues the loss of access to

256
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,920
personal and often irreplaceable items

257
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
including family photos videos and other

258
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,079
records can be devastating for

259
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
individuals as well

260
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,800
so when we say that something is

261
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,279
catastrophic is a catastrophe or is

262
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,839
devastating in this way we use them

263
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,160
metaphorically because these words

264
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,839
literally refer to large-scale physical

265
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,480
destruction so for you latin and greek

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
fans catastrophe

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
literally means physically bowling

268
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
something over and de vasto means

269
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
raising a town or a village to the

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,440
ground

271
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
so when a football manager says in a

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
post-match interview oh yeah i'm totally

273
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
devastated by the result he doesn't

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,680
really mean that he was physically

275
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
obliterated

276
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
by it

277
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
but it does make it more immediate it

278
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,279
makes it something that we can all

279
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,800
relate to

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,720
at the same time however it's also

281
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
exaggerating

282
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
and amplifying in the process now

283
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,000
one of the fbi's stated priorities on

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
its public facing website is what it

285
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
calls the going dark problem and many of

286
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
you will be familiar with the former fbi

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,839
director jim comey his testimony on what

288
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
going dark means it means lawful uh it's

289
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,920
the inability to access encrypted

290
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
communications

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
and darkness is of course another way in

292
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
which government agencies criminals and

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
vendors all use the same tactics to

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
depict cyber threats so let's do our

295
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
same visual analysis for a recent tv ad

296
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,279
for a consumer anti-virus vendor you'll

297
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,519
be very pleased to know i've sanitized

298
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,600
the name from this because i don't want

299
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,240
to get sued

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,959
sorry

301
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,800
i know what's coming next apologies i'm

302
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
laughing at my own jokes at

303
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,760
9 51 in the morning

304
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,240
so imagine a sinister male voice

305
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,240
today's digital world

306
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,839
has a dark side

307
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,920
because everyday things like shopping

308
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,240
banking and even browsing online can

309
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,639
expose personal information and make

310
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,360
people vulnerable to cyber criminals

311
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
lord vader's coming for that

312
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,279
good grief it must be serious

313
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,240
more than 850 million people in 16

314
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
countries were victims of cyber crime in

315
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
the last year alone mobile ransomware

316
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
attacks went up by 33

317
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
86 of adults may

318
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
may have put their information at risk

319
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,680
using public wi-fi and there's a victim

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
of identity theft every two seconds with

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
50 million customers around the globe we

322
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,120
are the consumer ally for today's

323
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
connected world meeting the dangers of

324
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,079
cybercrime with the power of cyber

325
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,040
safety on a mission to secure the

326
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
digital world just when it needs saving

327
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,720
the most

328
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,560
product x

329
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,120
protectors of the digital universe

330
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,399
now

331
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,279
if we take all of that imagery together

332
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
i would suggest

333
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,000
that this is not empowering

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
for your average citizen

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
this is not empowering for your average

336
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
business owner lord vader is coming to

337
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
get you so it's an intergalactic threat

338
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
from which rather like the grim reaper

339
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
you cannot escape

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
the numbers well it's number salad isn't

341
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
it there's too much going on there

342
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
let's just bowl people over with this

343
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,079
and

344
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,560
you need superheroes to save you from it

345
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
so this has an impact this has to have

346
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,480
an impact on the levels of capability

347
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,560
which in turn is going to have a

348
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,519
negative impact on how empowered people

349
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,199
feel to protect themselves

350
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,519
with vendors we could argue that in some

351
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,560
cases

352
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
it's just about buying the thing isn't

353
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,760
it

354
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,639
with criminals it's about doing the

355
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,959
thing that they want you to do

356
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,360
so you can see how it's useful but i

357
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
would argue that if we're thinking about

358
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,680
this as a public protection issue and

359
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
you'll see how that's relevant in a

360
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,079
second this is exactly the wrong kind of

361
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
message we want to be getting across to

362
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
people

363
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
and there's a knock-on effect as well

364
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,720
something i also work on is looking at

365
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
health and well-being human resilience

366
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
and burnout in the cyber security

367
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,240
industry and amongst information

368
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,320
security specialists

369
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
and the more people say

370
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,519
that the people who work on cyber are

371
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,880
superheroes i would argue the greater

372
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,680
the expectations that it generates that

373
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,680
you will all be always on and able to

374
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,959
save the world 24 7 and we know those

375
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
expectations are unreasonable and we

376
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,680
know those expectations are having

377
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,240
harmful effects on the people who work

378
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,880
in the industry so it's in all of our

379
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
interests and particularly the workforce

380
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
to think about this differently

381
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
represent it differently

382
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
then you can also think about other use

383
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,079
cases for representing it differently

384
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
and when you think that the people who

385
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
are on your boards

386
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
are also exposed

387
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
to this kind of imagery that i've just

388
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
shown you

389
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
they are

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
also as citizens your non-execs are

391
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
expecting you

392
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,839
to be those superheroes who will save

393
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,560
the day 24 7. so there's all sorts of

394
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
reasons why it's worth looking at

395
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,360
alternatives

396
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,839
okay so what could those alternatives be

397
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,320
well if you've got kids

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
you will know that disney um has done

399
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
its own representation of the dark web

400
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,519
this is a scene from uh wreck-it ralph

401
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
movie wreck-it ralph 2 ralph breaks the

402
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,959
internet and what i like about this is

403
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
that it breaks down tech issues

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
by a kind of extended metaphor if you

405
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,959
like taking all those abstract contacts

406
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
and mapping them to a physical place so

407
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
the internet is a physical

408
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
place

409
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
and the dark web is somewhere that you

410
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,359
descend into in an elevator so with

411
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,799
classics fans there are some nice

412
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,679
comparisons there to odysseus going down

413
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,079
to the underworld in the odyssey right

414
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
so it goes down in an elevator with this

415
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,520
chap called jb spamly who is an online

416
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,839
advertiser and he goes to buy an

417
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,039
insecurity virus

418
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,760
because ralph wants to rescue his best

419
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,039
friend vanellope von schweetz from a

420
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
driving game that she's she's become

421
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,120
addicted to and the driving game is

422
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,960
gorgeously entitled slaughter race

423
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
possibly not suitable for kids

424
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,440
um and so he wants to make the game

425
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
boring so that she will want to leave

426
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
so he says all right i'll go and buy a

427
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,640
virus and this is the virus and the

428
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
virus is called arthur

429
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
and in a recreation of comic shopkeeper

430
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
routines that for those of you who are

431
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,280
interested goes all the way back to 5th

432
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
century bc athens

433
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,559
um

434
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,120
we're kind of we're recreating the two

435
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
ronnie's four candles sketch we're

436
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
recreating monty python's dead parrot

437
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
sketch we're recreating if you want

438
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
something a little bit more sinister and

439
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,720
scary purchasing the mogwai in gremlins

440
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,799
and actually this is this is double damn

441
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
he's like half man half slog jabba the

442
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,799
heart i think he's voiced by russell

443
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,400
brand or someone who's trying to sound

444
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,480
like him so he's got that kind of

445
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
sort of slightly fake cockney gangster

446
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
thing

447
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
going on um and he says now you're not

448
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
going to do anything stupid with this

449
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
are you

450
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,160
so we have that sense of impending

451
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
impact that something might go wrong

452
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
we've got that dramatic irony the kids

453
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,520
who are watching this

454
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
still are encouraged to see that

455
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,120
negative impact because guess what it

456
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,960
does go wrong

457
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
when arthur is unleashed from the box he

458
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,280
explodes out and it makes people jump

459
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,840
but what we're doing is we're

460
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,039
demystifying it

461
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,360
we're not saying we're not saying to

462
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,720
kids

463
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
that this is cybergeddon

464
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
we're showing them the consequences in a

465
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,799
way that they can find accessible

466
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,120
and might actually be light-hearted

467
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,679
lighthearted could be the way to go

468
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
here's what i think we shouldn't be

469
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
doing

470
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
okay it is tempting i know

471
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,640
to harness the sense of alert that

472
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,840
people have in the context of the

473
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,000
pandemic but for me this is a negative

474
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
example i'm going to give you a positive

475
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
example in a second and i will finish

476
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
our promise on a positive example

477
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,160
but let's not exploit the pandemic for

478
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,240
commercial and cynical ends which

479
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,360
arguably

480
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
this does so prepare for a cyber

481
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
pandemic remember that immediacy secure

482
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,080
your everything now click the thing

483
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,799
click the thing we've got a problem

484
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
people and organizations have suffered

485
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,880
greatly from the coronavirus pandemic

486
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,000
that's true

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
many critical lessons are being learned

488
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
but none more important than that

489
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
another devastating crisis could be

490
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,799
brewing devastating

491
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,880
a catastrophic

492
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,760
cyber event has long been envisioned and

493
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,559
with today's digitally collected world a

494
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,480
global cyber pandemic is now a reality

495
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
this is nonsense isn't it

496
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
what the heck is a global cyber pandemic

497
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
it's not a thing

498
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
and aside from being

499
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,799
perhaps ethically and morally a little

500
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,039
bit unsuitable

501
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
all this does is gets people to buy a

502
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,360
thing

503
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,159
okay so it's inaccurate it's making full

504
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
use of the sensitizing rhetoric

505
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
um

506
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
but

507
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
a public health framework for cyber

508
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,039
security

509
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,520
has actually been promoted for a while

510
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,080
and we're going back 10 years really

511
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,679
where researchers have argued that what

512
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,960
you could do

513
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,760
is take the public health approach to

514
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,720
communicable diseases

515
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,880
non-communicable diseases and risk

516
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,919
behaviors and apply that to cyber and

517
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,080
information security and say right we've

518
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
got communicable threats

519
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
we've got non-communicable threats and

520
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,600
we have cyber risk behaviors so perhaps

521
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,679
what we can do is rather than harnessing

522
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,679
people's fear

523
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,559
we can harness people's sense of civic

524
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,360
and community responsibility because i

525
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,080
know it's easy for us isn't it to say oh

526
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,760
i've seen so many people not wearing

527
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,159
masks i've seen so many people uh you

528
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,000
know not behaving like they're supposed

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,400
to not socially distancing but there are

530
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
just as many people on there who are

531
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
wearing masks who are socially

532
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,440
distancing who are washing their hands

533
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,000
and maybe the time is ripe rather than

534
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
exploiting their fear to buy a thing to

535
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
harness these people and say right you

536
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
know how you did that thing

537
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
during coronavirus

538
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
okay have you thought about how you

539
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
could protect yourself your your loved

540
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,400
ones

541
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,159
everybody in your community and your

542
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
business

543
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,919
in terms of cyber security and

544
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,280
information security we know it works

545
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,880
we know that public health works

546
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,919
and just as a little reminder i'm going

547
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
to finish with evidence of this

548
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,640
from the 1940s and courtesy of

549
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200
the imperial war museum in the uk

550
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,080
[Music]

551
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
you may have met a few people who like

552
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
doing this sort of thing

553
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
they're a nuisance i agree but pretty

554
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
harmless

555
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
you have certainly seen thousands like

556
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,760
this they're not a nuisance they're a

557
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,400
real danger

558
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,080
hi stop it you

559
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
stop it stop it

560
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
come here what do you think you're up to

561
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
you've probably infected thousands of

562
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
people already what do you think this is

563
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
for

564
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
yes that's all right but here's another

565
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,039
way of using your handkerchief now

566
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,840
sneeze

567
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,200
come on

568
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
all right never mind

569
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
close your eyes

570
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:48,159
[Applause]

571
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,660
see what i mean

572
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,440
[Applause]

573
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
that's the idea

574
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,799
now you can carry on

575
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
so with that i'm going to finish off

576
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,279
with a plea

577
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
um there are simple ways of encouraging

578
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
people to protect themselves protect

579
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,679
others so let's have a thing together

580
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,240
about how we can do that without scaring

581
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
the hell out of people without trying to

582
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
just harness their fear about an issue

583
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
but to harness also their sense of civic

584
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
and community responsibility and with

585
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,039
that thank you very much indeed i'm

586
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
going to be guided by you guys as to

587
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,039
whether we've got any time for questions

588
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,400
thanks a lot

589
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,900
[Applause]

590
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,240
so we do have time for questions and i'd

591
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
be particularly interested to hear from

592
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,559
people who think i'm talking nonsense

593
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
and would like to push back on what i've

594
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
just said or maybe you're all

595
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,820
oh

596
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,520
[Music]

597
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
i yes what you say about things like

598
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,919
words like devastating etc but the

599
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
evolution of language and how word the

600
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,200
meaning of words changes yeah and enter

601
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,080
into the uh vernacular

602
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,840
much as google means search

603
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
so how do you

604
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
whilst i i agree with what you're saying

605
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,000
but also devastated definitely does not

606
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,799
mean

607
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,880
to raise a village

608
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
it's it's so in case at the back you

609
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,360
didn't hear that um it's a very very

610
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,880
good point about the evolution of

611
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,279
language and how devastating might not

612
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,720
necessarily

613
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
um just mean literally raising a village

614
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
to the ground so

615
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,480
i would

616
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,559
i suppose my pushback to that would be

617
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,440
we keep the vestige of it

618
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
we keep that kind of gut reaction to it

619
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
if you like at a physiological level

620
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,279
because that's the attachment we have

621
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,960
with it but you're absolutely right

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
these words get watered down and i think

623
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,039
um

624
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,720
this is the first reference to blaming

625
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,919
everything on social media here we go um

626
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,679
so i do think that how people

627
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,559
communicate online is really interesting

628
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,600
um if someone suffers an upset

629
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,720
or um grief of some kind online we say

630
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,559
that we're literally heartbroken hun

631
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,400
don't we well of course we're not

632
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
literally heartbroken but yet we say

633
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,279
that we're heartbroken it doesn't mean

634
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,360
we've had a cardiac arrest

635
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,679
um so there is a sense in which that

636
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,799
does absolutely get watered down

637
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,760
what what i don't think we lose is that

638
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
overall image that we refer to when we

639
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,760
want to connect to it and so reminding

640
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
people about that some of that is quite

641
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
helpful i think um

642
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,320
and

643
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
so that's on the metaphorical side with

644
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
the hyperbole

645
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,120
and the exaggeration

646
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,279
we're definitely getting more and more

647
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,520
exaggerated and online communication is

648
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,240
more exaggerated perhaps because

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,679
we're limited to a certain set of

650
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,120
characters

651
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
you know it's not a lengthy blog it's

652
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,919
140 or 280 so we have to be more

653
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,480
definite so we might ramp up how we feel

654
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,000
about everything

655
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
um what that doesn't take away is the

656
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,760
sense of how that's received

657
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,279
and that particularly when we're talking

658
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
about things like alerts

659
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
um you know with that we need to feel

660
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
sensitized oh my god i need to do

661
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,279
something about it but yes i think yours

662
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
is a very good point

663
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,799
anyone else

664
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
no well i'll be around all day so thank

665
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,880
you very much oh yes

666
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
right because

667
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,559
you need this now this might help you a

668
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,960
little bit is yes it's it's the kind of

669
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
communication of which i would approve

670
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,559
but i understand

671
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,720
it might not be great for sales figures

672
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,600
um yeah and of course what we have

673
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,840
through marshall mcluhan and everybody

674
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,480
and the medium being the message is we

675
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,279
have

676
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,360
50 to 60 years

677
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
actually probably about 100 years

678
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
of mass media marketing

679
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
and we have an advertising industry who

680
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,399
are you know perfectly entitled to be

681
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
there but they all work to the same

682
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,240
script which is by the thing now yeah

683
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,679
absolutely so

684
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,720
um

685
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,799
and i'm not suggesting i think it would

686
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,399
be unreasonable of me to suggest

687
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,320
wouldn't it that vendors stop trying to

688
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
sell things

689
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,559
but we are starting to see

690
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,399
different representations so i'm not

691
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,679
going to name the product because i

692
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,360
don't necessarily endorse a particular

693
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,520
product but we have one antivirus vendor

694
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
i don't know if the tv ads are over here

695
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,159
but they're certainly in the uk um where

696
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,039
they um get the the internet and it's a

697
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
room full of people and they stage an

698
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,640
intervention and they say so internet

699
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,600
we've brought you here today because

700
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
we're not very happy about how our

701
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
relationship is working out and it's

702
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,080
really it's funny because you've got an

703
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,760
80 year old woman talking about the

704
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
inappropriate image that she shared and

705
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,080
now it's all over and you know oh

706
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,399
they saw this image and everybody goes

707
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,600
oh you know so that you still feel like

708
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
you should buy the product i would argue

709
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
um but you're not being terrified by

710
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,799
blue light and the grim reaper and

711
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
you're also not being told that there's

712
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
nothing you can do about it and i and i

713
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,000
think that's the that's the helpful bit

714
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,720
um what i didn't talk about so much was

715
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
um

716
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,960
in relation to the the fbi website

717
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,799
you know that's weird isn't it because

718
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
you've got to scroll through about 6 000

719
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
words to get some advice on cyber crime

720
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
prevention one of which and i kid you

721
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,399
not

722
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,399
is um if all else fails turn off your

723
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,039
computer

724
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,880
which is not hugely empowering right so

725
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
um so

726
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,799
it'd be nice to be able to see some of

727
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
this enabling and empowering messaging

728
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,639
in with the buy it now so

729
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,720
okay

730
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,360
thanks ever so much
