00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
it feel good to say that after the year

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
we've just had

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,639
fun

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960
absolutely point out why not why not

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,320
fantastic to see as well so many

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,920
familiar face masks

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,359
faces sorry

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,199
it's great to be back at what is the

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,480
longest running

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
cyber security event of its kind in

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,599
ireland obviously we had a little bit of

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,199
an interruption last year but we've been

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
going since 2009 stayed very true to our

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,480
route it was not 500 meters from here

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
when brian holland got up in 2009 and

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
kicked off the very first event

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
and

21
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
then now here we are back bigger than

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
ever at a time of we hope renewal it's

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,840
great to be back in a superb venue

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
forgive me if i'm a little awestruck

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,640
normally when i'm here i'm wearing a

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,280
green shirt and screaming my lungs out

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440
but iris khan may be back and bigger

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
than ever but you know it it's if

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
fitting that we pay tribute to a

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
fantastic venue that we're in it

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,719
occurred to me on the way over here this

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
morning that

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
normally this is a venue that over the

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,240
years has played host to some

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
world-class defenders in the sporting

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,479
arena so it feels kind of appropriate

37
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,400
that today we're hosting superb

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
defenders in the field of cyber security

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
now for those who don't know me my name

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
is gordon smith i've been covering cyber

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
security as a journalist blogger

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
podcaster for the best part of 20 years

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,799
and i think it's safe to say that after

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
the year we've just had cyber security's

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,040
profile has never been higher

46
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,240
now of course that's both a good thing

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
and a bad thing uh when you're making

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,439
the uh

49
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
you know

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
joe duffy phone-in show that's not

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,479
necessarily the kind of profile that

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
cyber security ins wants but that that's

53
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,159
what we have

54
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,520
so i'm mentioning this just as a

55
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
backdrop to what we've had and it really

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
leads on to to the

57
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,759
superb lineup of speakers that we've got

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,360
for you today

59
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
once again i say this every year but

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,119
really the organizers have outdone

61
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
themselves this is an absolutely superb

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
lineup i promise you you're going to

63
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
hear some amazing presentations from

64
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,200
world class as i mentioned and diverse

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,719
group of speakers they'll have

66
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,320
thought-provoking presentations

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,439
throughout the day they'll be sharing

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,440
their experience and expertise on a wide

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
range of subjects including but not

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
limited to

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
the concept of cyber immunity security

72
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
myths ransomware

73
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,800
digital forensic tools the language that

74
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,640
we use to talk about cyber security

75
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,440
ransomware cyber skills working with law

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,200
enforcement and cybercrime and

77
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
ransomware

78
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
did i mention that enough i mean i'm

79
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,959
being flippant obviously but again

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
everybody remembers the attack on the

81
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
health service executive in may of this

82
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
year and you know that's probably not

83
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,480
the most

84
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
technically sophisticated threat many of

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
you will have encountered in your work

86
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
but nobody can deny the devastating

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
consequences it has so a number of the

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
presentations today

89
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
are dedicated to that and again that

90
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,280
just kind of feels right hopefully you

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
will come away armed with some fantastic

92
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,640
information to to help your

93
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
organizations to protect yourselves

94
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
better

95
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,959
in addition to the presentations as

96
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,440
always we've got the capture the flag

97
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
the cyber security challenge in parallel

98
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,239
to the main conference and so teams of

99
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
cyber security experts sort of pit their

100
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
wits in a controlled environment to see

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
if they can exploit vulnerabilities in

102
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
systems i recommend you take a look and

103
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
we'll be announcing the winners of that

104
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
as always throughout the course of the

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
day

106
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,920

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,880
sit at the table and food and drink will

207
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,639
be brought to you
