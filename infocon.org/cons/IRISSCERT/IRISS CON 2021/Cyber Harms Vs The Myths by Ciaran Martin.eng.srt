1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
so look um it's a real it's a real

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,440
pleasure to uh be here oh i've been told

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,360
to wrap up now

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
there we go um that's never happened to

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,920
me um that's never happened to me um

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,880
before um

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,480
so look it's really good to be here

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,560
thanks for the lovely introduction um

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
it's important to be here um don't need

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
to tell you 2021 is the year cyber harm

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,960
came to um ireland

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
um in a really obvious um way but i

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,800
wanted to talk about because i know with

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,000
various csus in the audience i know with

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
um lots of other people who are trying

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,680
their best to make the digital

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,000
environment better and safer they've

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
always got problems of traction and who

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,440
knows maybe the ransomware thing will

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
come and go

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
hopefully it will get a bit less um

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,719
hectic and manic on the ransomware front

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,360
than i did last year but the problems of

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,199
intrinsic insecurity in the digital

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
environment aren't going to go away and

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
we're here to try and make that better

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
and one of our enemies of trying to make

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,799
it better um which didn't apply in 2021

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,280
because harm was so visible is getting a

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
realistic appraisal of the

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
threat not so much the threat but

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
actually the harm

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
everyone here is working for

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,360
organizations that will do something

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
else or with customers who are there to

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,759
do something else ultimately the goal of

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
our society is not cyber security it's

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,439
just general prosperity it's creating

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
wealth and happiness in a in a safe

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
enough digital

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,040
environment

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
so when you've got all the priorities

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
people say well what's all the cyber

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,079
security stuff uh about so i wanted to

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
go through essentially three things i

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,240
wanted to talk to you about what about

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,200
harm what actual harm are we here to

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,759
defend against how likely is it and what

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
sort of harm do individual organizations

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
face and how do you assess that i want

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
to talk about harmors who do you have to

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
worry about and why and then i want to

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,399
talk a little bit about harm reduction i

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,680
just want to say in terms of bob's

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,399
presentation i really like that realism

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,360
it's really easy to over hype things and

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
to

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,759
inflate

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
threat in ways that sooner or later

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,000
people get wise to it and your

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,640
credibility diminishes so for example

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
the double extortion bit that he just

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
mentioned that brilliant presentation on

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
ransomware i'll be a lot less technical

65
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
but um the double extortion threat from

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,680
data leaks actually you know disruption

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
of networks from ransomware is a real

68
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,440
visible problem with loads of direct

69
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,239
evidence as we can all see um that that

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
is happening data leaks funnily enough

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
as he said not so much it's there as

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
part of the threat it does happen but

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
actually apart from just the sheer

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,040
volumes of data responsible media

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
organizations in for example the hse

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
crisis in ireland we're going to start

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
publishing easily accessible guides to

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,440
patient data we need to be highly

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
realistic and focused about the threat

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
i only caught the second half of bob's

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
presentation but he seems to have talked

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
about star wars so i'm going to continue

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
the hollywood vein and i'm going to

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,959
start with this whole realism of threat

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,640
and talk about war games many people in

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,080
the audience have seen war games all the

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
way back in 1983.

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,519
excellent

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,280
now last weekend i decided to rewatch

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
war games for two reasons one to show

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
the children and secondly because part

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
of my schtick was saying that war games

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,959
had done sort of harm to the cyber

94
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,360
narrative by over hyping the threat and

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,040
mischaracterizing it i thought well it's

96
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,319
been a while since i've watched it and

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
given this as part of my stable talk um

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,879
i should re-watch it and part of it's

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
absolutely brilliant i mean astoundingly

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
ahead of its time given that in two

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
years time it'll be 40 years

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
old

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
the whole idea the nonsensical idea of

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
taking humans out of the loop humans

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
couldn't be trusted so we should build a

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
machine in charge of nuclear weapons

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
which as the whole basis of the movie

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
goes goes somewhat awry the idea that

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
every system has some vulnerability

110
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,920
perhaps deliberately inserted by a back

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,799
door

112
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
if not accidentally the vulnerability of

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,799
easy

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
mistakes are really stupidly easily

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
guessable password from professor falcon

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,720
of of his um of his son

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,239
so really really powerful um stuff

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,080
but i stand by the narrative that i've

119
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
got there which is through no fault of

120
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,720
the excellent filmmakers and the

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
wonderful acting and script

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
it did set a tone it captured a tone

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
it's not its fault but it did set a tone

124
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
about the catastrophization of cyber

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,720
security in a way that just doesn't

126
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,600
match

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
reality

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,680
so what does it do um it says that

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,960
essentially cyber is about conflict it

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
will be harnessed by nation states to do

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,040
things that will cause absolute

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
cataclysm existential risk

133
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
and the crucial point there is that it

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
infantilizes people because it implies

135
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
that this is a harm so big so

136
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
militarized that a it's not really

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
likely to happen to you and me and b

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,919
that if it does there's absolutely

139
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
nothing you can do about it you have to

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
get a teenager to abscond to a calif

141
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,440
scone from fbi custody

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
race across to an island in california

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,960
and

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,800
harness a long retired professor out of

145
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
retirement to go and break the

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,960
pentagon's systems now funnily enough

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
i'm not going to tell you uh how to do

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
that uh today because i don't know also

149
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
it's worth remembering the 38 years on

150
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
from that film nothing remotely like

151
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
this has ever actually um happened

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,080
so i know you're going to go through

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
hundreds of um slides today but i'm just

154
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
going to call up one if if i may um um

155
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,759
as was mentioned i ran cyber security in

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
the uk for um six and a half uh years it

157
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
doesn't come up it doesn't really matter

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
um but oh there we are um yeah i don't

159
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,720
know if you can see that i can see it

160
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
over there um

161
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
but

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
um when i first

163
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
when i first

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
[Music]

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
left in september last year i did an

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
immediate sort of capture

167
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,960
it wasn't philosophical i wasn't trying

168
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
to prove anything but i was trying to

169
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
say look this is what i saw these are

170
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,120
the categories of harm and i wanted to

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
reprise it today um because

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
everyone can talk about ransomware and

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
ransomware is the theme of 2021 but

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,759
there are other types of real harm i

175
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,759
would view them as as chronic rather

176
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,080
than catastrophic they're often small

177
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
scale they matter to the organization

178
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
the institution the individual to whom

179
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,039
they

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
uh to whom um

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
they are uh targeted where it takes

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,800
place

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
even then they may be relatively small

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,960
scale but they act uh cumulatively they

185
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,880
aggregate into a huge societal national

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
and international problem and that's

187
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,440
what we want to get um after

188
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,680
so the three categories the first um for

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
those who can see it was essentially

190
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,919
about getting robbed there is an awful

191
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
lot of

192
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,400
data theft that can um sorry there's an

193
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
awful lot of cash theft that can range

194
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,319
from the small amounts of skimming

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
pensioners savings and so on all the way

196
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
through to the north korean bank heists

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,599
like the bank of bangladesh in 2015

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,160
where they were getting the end points

199
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
of the swift uh system um uh which was

200
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
weakly secured at the end point started

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
cashing out including you know quite

202
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
glamorous um tradecraft like through um

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
casinos in manila had made off with 81

204
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,680
million dollars and would have made up

205
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240
made up with 850 million dollars serious

206
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,759
money and not an eagle-eyed regulator in

207
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
federal reserve in new york spotted a

208
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,680
mistake in the english language

209
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,560
we talk a lot about ip theft five six

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
years ago an absolute obsession of the

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
obama administration in terms of what

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
they perceived to be consistent loss of

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
intellectual property and business

214
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,319
opportunity through hacks from the

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,960
people's republic of china of course the

216
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
chinese will retort back that this was

217
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,319
common practice by western powers for um

218
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
for many decades and we saw i think a

219
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
return of the threat to ip in a big way

220
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,360
last year with vaccine development

221
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,759
small organizations one close to where i

222
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,120
work elsewhere in the university of

223
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
oxford the jenner institute a small

224
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,360
biomedical research institution suddenly

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,240
thrust into the center of geopolitics

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
and funnily enough not particularly well

227
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
prepared for it and needing great

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
assistance to cope with the range of

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
cyber actors and i suddenly interested

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,319
in it

231
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
data theft

232
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
i think and this will be interesting for

233
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
a longer discussion we misunderstand

234
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,080
data theft we all talk about data as a

235
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
commodity it's a legal and an illegal

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
commodity why do people hack lists of

237
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
ticket masters customers if you've ever

238
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
been on us i'm sure you have troy hunt

239
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
excellent have ibn.com and find what

240
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
data breaches you're on you might wonder

241
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,959
hey

242
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
what what do they want with that and b

243
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
what are they going to do with my name

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
email address and last four digits of my

245
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
bank um of my bank card but through

246
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
excellent law enforcement and other

247
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
analysis we now know that there's resale

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
there's a huge data economy and there

249
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
are more significant cyber attacks we

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
must understand this in the public

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
discourse about the difference between a

252
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,720
small data set but with loads of

253
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
personal identifiers like say a security

254
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,040
clearance form which i'll come on to

255
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
versus a very large data set

256
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,240
which is relatively limited information

257
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
and therefore more limited

258
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
value so that is a category of real

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
persistent harm all of these attacks of

260
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
some sort are happening right now

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
and it's getting robbed it's an economic

262
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,560
social a prosperity um issue

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
at a more strategic level i think

264
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,319
there's getting getting weakened

265
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,519
espionage is abundant in cyberspace i

266
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,440
first noticed it when working for the uk

267
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
government in

268
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,200
2009 when the uk hosted the post

269
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
financial crash g20 summit which many of

270
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
us in the trade

271
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,839
became

272
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,360
came to know as a sort of international

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
festival of digital espionage with some

274
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
economic summatry on the side you know

275
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
an extraordinary sort of um

276
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
awakening of the way in which states

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
could use digital espionage east and

278
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
west all across the world in ways uh to

279
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
further their own objectives but in

280
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,360
terms of doing strategic harm if you go

281
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
back to data theft

282
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,560
and i'll dwell on this a little bit

283
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,680
later i think the most strategically um

284
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
impactful hack that i've ever come

285
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
across is the hack allegedly um or

286
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
confirmed by the americans to be

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,839
from the chinese state of the office of

288
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,440
personnel management the u.s civil

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
service database in 2015

290
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
and that was 21.4 million security

291
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
clearance records of everyone who'd

292
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
applied for a federal government job in

293
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,760
the us in the first 14 years of this

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
century

295
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,959
and just pause on that because i don't

296
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
know but about you but if you've ever

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
had to fill in a government security

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
clearance form at the advanced level you

299
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,399
tell them

300
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,839
absolutely everything

301
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,600
every primary identifier and every

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,399
secondary identifier is now is now gone

303
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,680
that is strategic espionage impact then

304
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,000
of course you move on to the current era

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,760
you have um

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
the us accusing the russians of the

307
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
solar winds

308
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,200
operation a very stealthy reasonably

309
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,600
sophisticated supply chain update

310
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
poisoning which gives access to u.s

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,800
government and big tech business for up

312
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
to for up to nine months

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
so you get that sort of harm we talk

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
increasingly about political

315
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
interference the sowing of discord not

316
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
particularly in terms of a political

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
objective but if you take for example

318
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
what um the uh the us have accused the

319
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,000
russians of in 2016

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
and what other western countries have

321
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,959
accused

322
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,320
russia and other countries of doing

323
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,839
subsequently is actually using

324
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,519
not just disinformation which is a

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,880
different uh problem but using hacking

326
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,279
to ferment political discord in a sense

327
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
it's espionage except you don't keep it

328
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
secret

329
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
nobody objects to espionage

330
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
in sort of geneva convention terms it's

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
allowed but people do object to for

332
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,839
example if you take the

333
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,600
um the operation the us have said the

334
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
russians did against the clinton

335
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
campaign in 2016.

336
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
the first stage of it is just espionage

337
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
secretary clinton was well on her way it

338
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,040
was believed at the time didn't turn out

339
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
that way to be the president of the

340
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
united to be the next president of the

341
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,920
united states be somewhat odd if the

342
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
russians weren't spying on that campaign

343
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,839
and most american national security

344
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,720
professionals would have been

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,000
unsurprised and not particularly

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
objecting of that the difference is

347
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,399
publishing all the information at a

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
particular time in a particular way

349
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
to

350
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,800
weaken the political strength of the u.s

351
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
system in a way that we've seen them try

352
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,279
in other countries such as the uk and

353
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,240
france with with less success

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,160
there's then and we have seen cases of

355
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,320
this here in ireland what people will

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
call pre-positioning

357
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
when i was head of the national cyber

358
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,600
security center in the uk and you can

359
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,040
see this in the annual reports the

360
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,360
latest of which was published yesterday

361
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
they categorized the incidents we did

362
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,760
about seven thousand incidents in my day

363
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,440
into two ways one is called um rtu

364
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
reported to us in other words somebody

365
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
notices something and says can you help

366
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
and if we could we we did

367
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
and the other was dbu detected by us in

368
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,839
other words the victim organization knew

369
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
absolutely nothing about it but it was

370
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
detected by the state using its elite

371
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
lawful capabilities so they tended to be

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
more specific

373
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,440
and more sophisticated and more targeted

374
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
you would get them and there's plenty of

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
uh coverage um of an incident in the

376
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,800
energy sector in ireland a few years ago

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,839
um

378
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,440
you detect them

379
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
they're unlike

380
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,160
excuse me

381
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,040
unlike some of the other uh intrusions

382
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
they're trying not to be caught an ip

383
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,279
theft in data breaches most hackers that

384
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,720
i've come across in significant

385
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
incidents don't care about being caught

386
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
after the event pre-positioning you want

387
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
to stay there undetected for as long as

388
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,680
you can preferably in in

389
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
in in perpetuity

390
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,880
so someone like the national cyber

391
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
security center or partner finds it and

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
you think what's that doing there

393
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,440
and you can't ask it because it's a

394
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,680
piece of highly sophisticated code and

395
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
you certainly can't ask who put it there

396
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
what you can surmise

397
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
based on lots of experience and looking

398
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,199
at

399
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
analysis of the motivations of

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
potentially hostile states and looking

401
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,199
at what other um

402
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
um looking at the sort of networks

403
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,959
they're in you can surmise that they're

404
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,920
there as essentially a beach head should

405
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,760
things get more difficult and they want

406
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,360
to use it for disruptive attack uh later

407
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
in the

408
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,360
future so a real significant weakening

409
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
of your strategic position when we talk

410
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
about offensive cyber operations i think

411
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
it's commonly misunderstood certainly

412
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,360
among policy makers that they're just

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,800
these capabilities that you can just

414
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,519
fire off at somebody if i'm in a state

415
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
of tension with you

416
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
and i have a implant on your network and

417
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,199
then we make peace and then all of a

418
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,440
sudden i get into tension over here i

419
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
can't just take it from there and fire

420
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
it over there it takes a very very long

421
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,240
time so you see even in peace time in

422
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
times of relative calm you see a lot of

423
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,199
this very difficult and sophisticated uh

424
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,880
pre-positioning of of implants

425
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,440
pausing there just for a second i think

426
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
what you will notice about these two

427
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
categories and six

428
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
items of cyber harm

429
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
they're mostly silent

430
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
um sometimes they're sort of tangible

431
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,959
and measurable in terms of you can

432
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,360
certainly measure cash theft you can

433
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,519
measure to some extent the impact of ip

434
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,519
theft you can measure to some extent the

435
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
impact of data theft but it's quiet and

436
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
there's no sort of social disruption

437
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
coming off of other than you get an odd

438
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
data breach notice and unfortunately

439
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
your bank account might be lighter than

440
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,800
it previously uh was but i think we're

441
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,279
now getting into the stage increasingly

442
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,519
and 2021 has brought this into sharp

443
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,160
focus where people are starting to get

444
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
hurt

445
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
we have deliberate targeted destructive

446
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
attacks

447
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
not an attack that hurts somebody but if

448
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
you want to measure of the

449
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,639
sophistication of potential

450
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
um destructive attacks look at what

451
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
happened to the french tv station tv

452
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
sanc monde in 2015

453
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,440
hackers operating from outside france in

454
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,079
an incredibly sophisticated operation

455
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,360
taking out a broadcasting network for 11

456
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
hours putting it back on which was

457
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
harder than actually deleting it and in

458
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
a sense a proof of concept that perhaps

459
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,399
there are some a relatively small number

460
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,920
of accomplished states actors and

461
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,480
they're all state actors who can do um

462
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
who who can do this

463
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,959
perhaps approximating a bit more of the

464
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
war games type capability but a lot of

465
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
the destruction

466
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
has been accidental when people say to

467
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
me why would anybody target my business

468
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
i say well

469
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
the two most difficult um

470
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
incidents of my career were within six

471
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,039
weeks of each other in 2017 the

472
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,439
so-called wannacry worm an incredibly

473
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,359
badly designed piece of ransomware that

474
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,720
ripped through a hundred different

475
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
countries

476
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
attacked the disrupted the british nhs

477
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,720
if you're if it's a real ransomware

478
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,640
attack probably the single stupidest

479
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,400
target on planet earth trying to extort

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
money out of both for reasons of public

481
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,919
policy and lack of money in the first

482
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:24,959
place

483
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
uh it disrupted the um signs on railway

484
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,000
platforms in germany which are i

485
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
struggled to think was the uh target of

486
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,679
the north koreans and six weeks later

487
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,080
you had not petria

488
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,120
um

489
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,720
if you want to look at destructive

490
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
attacks many experts will point you

491
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,960
towards the apparent russian activity

492
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
against ukraine

493
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
turning out the

494
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
supply of electricity in central kiev in

495
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
2015 but also having a go at a

496
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
professional services firm in ukraine in

497
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,480
2017 was something that then went viral

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,559
left um

499
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
left 20 of the world's merchant shipping

500
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
floating around being controlled by

501
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
whatsapp because maersk the danish

502
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
shipping giant was

503
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
um was disrupted but lest you think

504
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,440
mercs were targeted another victim was

505
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,039
production of the chocolate factory in

506
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
tasmania which i definitely struggle to

507
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,760
think is the um

508
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,000
was the intended uh target

509
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,760
and then we get to ransomware i don't

510
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
need to increase the ransomware crisis

511
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
um let alone here but i will say this

512
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,720
about ransomware we're only talking

513
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,799
about it in me this audience would have

514
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,720
been talking about it a few years ago

515
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
but we're only talking about it in

516
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
mainstream terms these days because of

517
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
its social disruption and the paradox to

518
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,440
go back to the war games analogy

519
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,080
is that it hasn't been states that have

520
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,960
been

521
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,520
disrupting health care disrupting energy

522
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,280
supplies in the us disrupting food

523
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
production in the us and food

524
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,720
distribution in sweden and schools in

525
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
london and i could go on it's been

526
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
criminals using medium sophistication

527
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,559
but with reckless abandon and that is

528
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,720
taking us closer but there's an asterisk

529
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
there because it hasn't happened yet

530
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,559
that is taking us closer to the

531
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,440
potential catastrophic impact

532
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
of cyber harm so the reason i put this

533
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
up i'll leave it on for a few minutes

534
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,200
the reason i put this up

535
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,679
was that i find this helpful

536
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,039
when you're going to boards and the

537
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,720
board conversation is so important and

538
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,840
just to say

539
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
where in this

540
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
matrix is this organization is your

541
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
organization

542
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,559
is it a data rich organization has it

543
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,000
got a particular piece of i.t is it

544
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
strategically significant in the

545
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
political system is it strategically

546
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
significant

547
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
in terms of something that someone would

548
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
want to pre-position on everyone's at

549
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
risk of the destructive attack and so

550
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
forth and it helps you target

551
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
it also then helps you think about the

552
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
harmers

553
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,520
we don't

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,720
for example have for now a problem with

555
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
um international terrorism and um and

556
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
and serious cyber disruption because

557
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
they cannot acquire the sorts of

558
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
capabilities that needs to see in time

559
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
effort money skills people and

560
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,919
infrastructure to to do it but we do

561
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,679
worry about nation states particularly

562
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
the further down and right you go on

563
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,919
this um uh grid

564
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,880
and of course cyber criminality is out

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,360
of control

566
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,440
so to finish i want to talk a little bit

567
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
about harm um

568
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,679
about harm reduction

569
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,840
and i want to just say one thing about

570
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
two things sorry first about how we

571
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
think about this problem before saying

572
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
further three um

573
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,400
uh before saying a further few things

574
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,799
about how we respond to it

575
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
the first is i don't think we've had an

576
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
honest enough conversation about the

577
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
limitations

578
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
about um

579
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
the limitations to what traditional

580
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,080
organs of the state can do particularly

581
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
law enforcement

582
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
i'm struggling to remember in certains

583
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,559
of saying eu country the uk or the five

584
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,159
eyes alliance i'm struggling to think of

585
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,679
the last time there was a major

586
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,720
gang

587
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,559
operating at large scale in the way some

588
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,559
of the ransomware operators are doing

589
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,400
from within any of those jurisdictions

590
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
because it's crazy you couldn't hide it

591
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
the police would kick down the door so

592
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
they don't operate from there they

593
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
operate as president biden has said from

594
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
russia from other countries from parts

595
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,559
of um the indian subcontinent and

596
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,400
sometimes from parts of africa from

597
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,320
places where it's hard to get

598
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
traditional law enforcement mechanisms

599
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
to work and we need to understand that

600
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
because it limits what we can normally

601
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
what we can normally do

602
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
for the first time in human history it's

603
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,520
you're able to cause large scale harm to

604
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
a society without ever setting foot in

605
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
it or getting an accomplice to set foot

606
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
in it and that's something that we

607
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
really need to think about

608
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
the second thing is can you hack your

609
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
way back out of this there's been a lot

610
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,200
of discussion and coverage this week in

611
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
this month about u.s led operations

612
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
against ransomware operators and they're

613
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
great disrupting their infrastructure

614
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
outing them sending arrest warrants if

615
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
some of them the affiliates are based in

616
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,400
places like romania and ukraine you can

617
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
get at them and so forth but it is

618
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,679
tactical

619
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,320
and you can hack your way back a bit um

620
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,919
out of it particularly against cyber

621
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,400
criminals but often as with the emote

622
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
group that were disrupted in january

623
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
this year they seem to become i'm sorry

624
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,000
the immigration boltnet people they seem

625
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to be back

626
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
and this it's a very limited uh toolkit

627
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,159
when it comes to when it comes to nation

628
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,120
states

629
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
so we do have to think about our own

630
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
defenses

631
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
i just want to make four points

632
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,200
one is the importance of basics i know

633
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,799
it's a cliche i know it's not lost in

634
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
this audience but it really has to be

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
said

636
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,400
every

637
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
hack that i've mentioned every major

638
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,280
incident

639
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,400
even the most sophisticated ones ex part

640
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,039
of the story is some element of basic uh

641
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,799
vulnerability

642
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,679
so

643
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,919
the very first incident i dealt with

644
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
when the ncsc was stood up was a brute

645
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,320
force attack on camelot the uk's

646
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
national lottery operator with more than

647
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
10 million

648
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,280
uk um

649
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
subscribers

650
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,280
two-factor authentication wasn't on it

651
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,400
is now

652
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,320
simple similarly the attack on the

653
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,919
westminster parliament same thing

654
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
at organizational level

655
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,039
anomaly detection and network monitoring

656
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,039
look at the espionage attack and go back

657
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,640
to that attack and described as the most

658
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
strategically impactful espionage

659
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,159
operation of the digital age the chinese

660
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
against the americans there are parts of

661
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,919
that story that are really sophisticated

662
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,360
which in the interest of time i won't go

663
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,360
into but another part of the story

664
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,320
involves the um hackers copying the

665
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,120
database using the american government's

666
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
own computing power for 26 hours loads

667
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
of it and nobody noticed

668
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,880
continuously so at three in the morning

669
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,480
the whole thing was just blazing and

670
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
nobody and the data was

671
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,080
retrievable but nobody was looking

672
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
so i think patching as um as bob

673
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,919
mentioned again one of the major

674
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
incidents just before the ncac set up

675
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,440
one of the reasons it was set up was the

676
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
talk talk hack in the uk

677
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,159
done by teenagers using a sql injection

678
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,799
an exploit boulder than they were again

679
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,880
because patching hadn't been done and

680
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,799
basic integration of a data set from an

681
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,559
acquisition hadn't been done so the

682
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
basics really matter is the first point

683
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
the second is resilience and

684
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,039
preparation and the way in which systems

685
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
are architected we don't want to be in

686
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
the position again where you have to

687
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,039
rely on the heroics of people helping

688
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,159
with the hse response and i'm profoundly

689
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,159
shaken by the colonial pipeline

690
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,760
experience because it broke the first

691
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,679
rule of critical infrastructure

692
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,360
technology it wasn't a hack on the

693
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,039
pipeline it was a hack on the enterprise

694
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,200
network and all the guarantees that i

695
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,120
heard hundreds of times all over the

696
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
world from every critical infrastructure

697
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
company i ever heard of which is that

698
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
the operational technology is

699
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,919
sufficiently segregated from the

700
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
enterprise technology broke down in that

701
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,400
specific case this really shouldn't be

702
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
happening we need to design security

703
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
into the systems in a way if you want an

704
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,799
example you could look at the uk

705
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,799
national cyber security center's blog on

706
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,279
uk smart meters where they're not immune

707
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
from hacking in any way but if you want

708
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
to do national level harm you have to

709
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,080
work really really hard

710
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,679
so it's basics

711
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,760
resilience

712
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,799
the third thing is about the

713
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,120
conversation with boards i think we have

714
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
to bring this to life with boards and

715
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
decision takers whether in government or

716
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
the private sector we have to talk to

717
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
them about whether it's this model or

718
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
another model doesn't matter we have to

719
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
talk to them about the reality of harm

720
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
and the real risks but then talk about

721
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,919
things and educate them about

722
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,159
counterfishing strategies about how to

723
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,159
interpret the ethical phishing test know

724
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
a click rate going down from 25 to 10

725
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
it's it's decent progress but it's not

726
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,440
the whole story if the 10 includes the

727
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
systems administrator the people with

728
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,400
the keys

729
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,360
to the kingdom also 10 isn't zero so

730
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,120
somebody's got in what happens then

731
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
where are the defenses where do they

732
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
kick in

733
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
and there was a kind reference to the uk

734
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,960
national cyber security center's

735
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
publications the one i would recommend

736
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,840
for that conversation is the board

737
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,720
toolkit

738
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,279
getting a board to appreciate five basic

739
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,600
slightly technical questions

740
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
about the cyber defenses of an

741
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
organization but what's really important

742
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
to me

743
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,799
about that is that we have to tell

744
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,720
boards to get a little bit technical

745
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,039
i've never seen a board say pension

746
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
liabilities terribly complicated can we

747
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
get someone to do a powerpoint

748
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,679
presentation on it so we can um so we so

749
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,320
so we can um

750
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
so that we can tick the box that happens

751
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
too often in cyber

752
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,480
and my final point though

753
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
is and it sounds slightly schmaltzy but

754
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
i believe in it passionately

755
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,440
is about our digital environment i

756
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,039
strongly believe

757
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,320
that we shouldn't be talking about

758
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
cyberspace in militaristic terms a

759
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,919
domain of operations yes it is a domain

760
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,159
of operations nato who says so and

761
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,880
rightly so but it's more an environment

762
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,159
and we learned that

763
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,600
if we didn't already know it during the

764
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
pandemic it's somewhere where we went to

765
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
live and work online

766
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,440
and it saved us professionally and

767
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
personally during the pandemic and it's

768
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,279
full of rubbish

769
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,120
it's it's full of structural

770
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,720
insecurities it's full of things we can

771
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
do something about it's full of brand

772
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
spoofing so why aren't we using more

773
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
dmarc more widely it's full of

774
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
maliciously hosted websites why aren't

775
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
we getting people to take those down a

776
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,600
bit more and in areas like iot with a

777
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,480
real opportunity never mind ai quantum

778
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
and so forth to actually

779
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
look ahead look at the technology that's

780
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,640
coming and clean up the digital

781
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,360
environment and in that way we will get

782
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
rid of

783
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
more of this harm more of this time for

784
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,080
more of the people and thanks for

785
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,060
listening to me

786
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:52,429
[Applause]

787
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,480
i'm

788
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
i'm obliged to mention that i've

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
received no payment for this talk other

790
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,559
than

791
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
a selection of irish crisps which i will

792
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,000
be enjoying enormously for the rest of

793
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
the day

794
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,559
i'll be around for questions but i won't

795
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,740
be sharing the crisps thank you

796
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,990
[Applause]
