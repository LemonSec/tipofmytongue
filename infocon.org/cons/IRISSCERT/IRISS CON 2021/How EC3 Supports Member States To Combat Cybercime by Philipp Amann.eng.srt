00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,040
thank you very much and uh before i

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,279
start i'd like to thank brian and the

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,040
team you know for organizing the event

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,759
for having us it's great to be here

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,240
great to have a real audience and so i'm

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
really looking forward to you know

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
giving my little speech and view on the

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,800
cyber crime

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
landscape and you know i wanted to ask

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
this question this is really a question

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
for me but also a question for you are

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
we doing the right thing but before i

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
start i'm going to share a little secret

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
with you you know i'm a risk taker i

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,079
like to live

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,440
dangerously

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,680
and what i'll do is i will ever so

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,879
slightly

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
disagree with the grand great

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,079
bob mcardle you know i can do that

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,000
that's a teaser he's a good friend he's

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,280
a good partner

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,600
but the two points i'd like to sort of

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
you know challenge a little bit from

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
from our side but you know without

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,520
further ado just going into into

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
my presentation and just to tell you

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
what we do how we work

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,760
obviously as as europol we are the eu's

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
law enforcement agency we support the 27

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
member states we support

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,080
non-eu partners but we don't start our

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,159
own investigations we don't you know we

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,479
don't have policing powers but so what

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,560
we are we're really law enforcement as a

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,880
service you know we provide key

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
expertise to our member states so none

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,759
of your partners we provide you know

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
aggregated intelligence packages

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
uh we provide um you know tools and

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,680
services

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
and then we have a whole networks of a

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
network of liaison officers that are

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,040
actually physically sitting in the

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
building that's not just from the 27

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,840
member states but from all the countries

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,280
with whom we have none of your countries

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
with whom we have an operation agreement

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
so for instance the us is currently

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,399
present with 11 different agencies

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
now

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
in so we were established in 2013 where

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,840
part of europol

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,360
really with the idea being that we need

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,479
to have a dedicated center to deal with

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960
cyber crime to support our member states

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
in dealing with the problem

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
but then we realized and that was

59
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
something you know similar to a startup

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,639
in 2014 when we still had you know we're

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,239
able to go to a bar at europa you've

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,920
ever come to europe we have our own bar

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
you know the blue bottle like you would

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,879
know that well brian you as well

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,599
definitely right and uh so on the back

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,319
on

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,800
on in a little piece of paper we came up

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
with the idea of saying what we need to

69
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
have a network of cyber crime

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
investigators so we established that

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
done in 2014 at the end of 2014 you know

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
against a lot of pushback and a lot of

73
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
countries being very critical because

74
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,160
they thought well that's a duplication

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
we already have but the problem is you

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,599
know a lot of those liaison officers are

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,239
not cyber crime experts now you know a

78
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
few

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,599
years later we have a platform and we

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
host a platform which is

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,400
member state let it it's well member

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
let's it's intelligence led and it's

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
very operational

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,160
this is now a platform where we have you

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
know 20 different law enforcement

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
agencies from 17 different countries

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
including seven

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,159
non-um eu countries and if you look you

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,480
know the the us just joined with a third

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
agency this is to show how much

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,599
importance they

92
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,760
they um attached to that platform and

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,599
with belgium as one of the last

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,959
countries to join us and interesting

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,080
enough they were quite critical in the

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
in the beginning so this is now a unique

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
operational platform globally this does

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
not exist there's not a second platform

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
like the jcat and all of our operations

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
everything we've been done doing over

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
the last you know since 2014 has been

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
coordinated prioritized uh through

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,720
deconflicted through through the jk so

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
that's a you know this is what we do

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,799
one of the one of the services key

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,400
services that we provide to member

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
states and uh none of your partners to

108
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
combat cybercrime

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
but when we were established uh it was

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
already clear that we need to have those

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
different networks you know as they say

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,440
you can't

113
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
fight cybercrime on your own you know

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,799
can't do it as an organization you can't

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,400
do it as law enforcement you can't do it

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
at a national level you need to have

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
that international network of partners

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,239
and you need to work with industry you

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
need to work with academia you need to

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,120
work with the c cert community you know

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
we need to all come together uh to

122
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
create that network and you know we have

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
currently

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
three different advisory groups with 80

125
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
experts and you know a lot of those

126
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
companies that support us are actually

127
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
in the room thank you thank you for that

128
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
thank you for your continued support

129
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
um and it's been hard to get where we

130
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
are right now uh to see eye to eye you

131
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
know to respect each other it's it's a

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
huge effort as you know you know build

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
the trust have your personal

134
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
relationships but those 80 experts from

135
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
those three different areas they're

136
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
hugely important for our work and what

137
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
we do actually we have annual work plans

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,240
where we agree on what we want to

139
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
achieve what we you know what we want to

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
deliver at the interview and we measure

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
our cooperation based on that i think

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
it's a really successful model but like

143
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
i said it's it's hard work i need to

144
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
continue investing into that from both

145
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
sides and what you see here is despite

146
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
the pandemic what we've achieved in 2020

147
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
i think it's a huge success so thank you

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,880
again for your help thank you for your

149
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
continued support you see it's not just

150
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
strategic and tactical but also a lot of

151
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,280
operational activities that have been

152
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,919
supported with the help from our advisor

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,400
group members

154
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
now

155
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,440
before i go into the key threats and

156
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
trends so that's one of our key services

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
obviously you know is to provide an

158
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,120
overview of what where what are the

159
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,479
threats what are the trends what

160
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
happened you know during the last 12

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
months

162
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
what's the future going to look like but

163
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,160
before i do that you know i just wanted

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,800
to you know credit that to vic baines

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
she is the mother of the iocta i think

166
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,919
it was 2013 wasn't it

167
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,680
the first that you drafted the first

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,520
iocta

169
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
or even 2011

170
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
there you go

171
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
so ever since you know we've kept your

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
legacy alive and

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
this is now the key strategic product

174
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
when it comes to assessing the

175
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,039
cybercrime landscape in the eu

176
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
we have obviously input from a law

177
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
enforcement colleagues but also from

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
industry and academia now i won't dive

179
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
into you know the details here because

180
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
we've heard all of that what you see

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
here really should reflect what you're

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,199
seeing as well there might be some

183
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,560
differences because obviously as law

184
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
enforcement we tend to see the end of

185
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
the attack chain whereas as industry you

186
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,120
often see you know the initial attack

187
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,919
vectors the iocs but i think in in

188
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,160
overall you know terms it's it's a very

189
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
comprehensive document every by the way

190
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
all the documents i'm going to mention

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
here you can download from my website

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,759
but you know see crime muscle service

193
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
ransomware as a service

194
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
you know huge problem mobile malware

195
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,400
huge increase obviously reflecting how

196
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
we use our phones linked to things like

197
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
sim swapping

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,919
you know to bypass two-factor

199
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
authentication and whatnot but

200
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
at the last point obviously you know the

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
continued challenge that we have as law

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
enforcement which is linked to the

203
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,800
chrome abuse of encryption criminal

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
abuse of cryptocurrencies criminal abuse

205
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,120
of privacy enhancing technology so just

206
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
diving into some of the key findings

207
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
again you know we heard about ransom

208
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
where we heard about you know triple

209
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,479
quadruple

210
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
attacks that's we can certainly confirm

211
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,919
that you know we see a lot of

212
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,919
ddos attacks for ransom coming up again

213
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
you know in in combination with

214
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
ransomware attacks uh just maybe a point

215
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
and um

216
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
brian i think you can hopefully confirm

217
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
that gdpr

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
if you become a rans a victim of

219
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,160
ransomware

220
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
even if you decide not to report this to

221
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
law enforcement even if you're able to

222
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
you know fix this on your own you still

223
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
have to report it on the gdpr it's a

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,960
data controller linked to the data

225
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
controller function so there is an

226
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
obligation to report under the gdpr if

227
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
you you know if your data has been has

228
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
been encrypted

229
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
now one of the years we also look into

230
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
is is combating child sex abuse online

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
unfortunately a huge increase during the

232
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
pandemic um much more at least based on

233
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
the data that we've seen much more

234
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,120
child sexual abuse material that has

235
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
been produced and circulated

236
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,000
um

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
we see a move to peer-to-peer networks

238
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,759
well that that's has been there but it's

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
still there huge problem and you know

240
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,160
what makes it even harder to combat that

241
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,919
that form of criminality is the fact

242
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,800
that we see more and more self-generated

243
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
explicit material that is being

244
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,280
exchanged

245
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
amongst young people

246
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
dark web still one of the main platforms

247
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,239
no surprises there

248
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,240
in the area of online fraud i think what

249
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
we've seen there is you know how quickly

250
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
criminals have adapted to you know

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
adopted

252
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
to the the the kovit 19 narrative

253
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
use that to improve their

254
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,520
their fishing and and fishing campaigns

255
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
and and you know certain fraud schemes

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
and what's also important and we see

257
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,679
this a lot is also in terms of damages

258
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
yes ransomware is the dominant threat

259
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,440
but

260
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,958
um it's actually also business email

261
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,480
compromise that we still see as a huge

262
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
problem

263
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
and then the dark web interesting there

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
creating criminal activity what we see

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,680
is now move away from also based because

266
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
of you know successful law enforcement

267
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,880
actions you know that always has an

268
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
impact replacement you know strategy or

269
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
or reaction to that we said we now see a

270
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
move to

271
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,519
distributed uh

272
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,760
encrypted communication platforms such

273
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,480
as

274
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
telegram and wicker and also a tendency

275
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,279
to use more privacy enhanced

276
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,600
cryptocurrencies

277
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
now

278
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
i mentioned you know i i didn't get to

279
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,279
the point so that's the first

280
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,959
ever so slightly pushback you know

281
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,279
because uh bob he did mention you know

282
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,360
1989

283
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
ransomware first sort of you know

284
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
ransomware attack now it's true

285
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
obviously this is light years away from

286
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
what we're seeing right now but the

287
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
point is and this is sort of link what

288
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
vic has had said what brian has said you

289
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,959
know eugene has said

290
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,440
there are no sort of black swans or very

291
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
rarely and brian you actually had this

292
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
as a screen very rarely would we see

293
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,360
those black swans the you know curveball

294
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
that's like oh my god nobody ever

295
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,959
thought about this

296
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,560
so that's why it is important to look

297
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
back and say well 1989 there was the

298
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
first attempt you know to encrypt data

299
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
of course it's very very different from

300
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
what we're seeing right now just like

301
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,000
with artificial intelligence you know it

302
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
was 1940 that the first ai systems were

303
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
programmed and and guess what i mean you

304
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
know the the basic principles are still

305
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
the same now of course we have the

306
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
computing power we have the we have the

307
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
data so now we can actually use it we

308
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
have that convergence the same with you

309
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
know i don't know quantum computing you

310
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,279
know introduced conceptually in 1980 so

311
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,279
all these concepts have been around so

312
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
there are no black swans in that sense

313
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
there's a real evolution and what you

314
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
see here is something that we actually

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
i'm reusing this in in our 2015 iota we

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
had that in there and we call it the

317
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
cyber crime trichotomy we tried to sort

318
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
of you know have one infographic that

319
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
explains you know based on our

320
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
understanding how cyber crime works you

321
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
know you have sort of the you know the

322
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
cyber criminals and you know at the

323
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,720
bottom you have the unskilled ones that

324
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
use you know the tools and services to

325
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
attack a large number of potential

326
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
victims so you know if they're

327
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,279
successful

328
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,200
you know typically their profit is very

329
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,440
small but as we move up they become more

330
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
skilled more sophisticated even and and

331
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,360
a lot of times you know at the top they

332
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
won't even share the tools and they

333
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,079
those are the ones that have the

334
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
targeted attacks if they're successful

335
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
big game hunting you know they have the

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
huge successes why is this important

337
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
this is linked to you know what we've

338
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,040
heard before if you look at the bottom

339
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,279
we cannot we do not have the resources

340
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,680
to investigate that you know high volume

341
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,240
low volume low high volume low value

342
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,360
criminality we just simply do not have

343
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,120
the resources we can't investigate

344
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,200
investigate ourselves out of this which

345
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
means all these principles we've heard

346
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,959
you know security by design security by

347
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,880
default privacy by design privacy by

348
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
default cyber resilience whatever we're

349
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,320
going to call you know those basic

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
principles the things that i've been you

351
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
know discussing for years now again this

352
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,560
is not news you know we know what the

353
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
basic cyber security controls are we

354
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
know what we need to do network

355
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
segregation um you know monitor your

356
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,240
admin accounts two-factor multi-factor

357
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,959
authentication you know test your

358
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,800
backup plans all the things that we know

359
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
we should be doing

360
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
a lot of times unfortunately we don't do

361
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
because if we get that right if we

362
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,800
collectively manage to increase the

363
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,839
cyber security baseline increase cyber

364
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,680
resilience with this idea being that

365
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
there is no you know full security no

366
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
100 security so eventually we'll all be

367
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
you know a victim of a cyber crime

368
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,200
attack we need to be prepared we need to

369
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
be ready you know we need to have a

370
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,519
incident response plan plans not just in

371
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
you know sort of prepare but also test

372
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,160
it

373
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
because if that's working if we if we

374
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
manage to do that again collectively

375
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
we can focus as law enforcement together

376
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,200
with industry obviously csert you know

377
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,040
all the partners to focus on the top

378
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
criminals and the ones that you know

379
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
really cause the biggest damage not just

380
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
financially if you look at ransomware

381
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
but also now obviously having a

382
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
situation where we go way beyond

383
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,959
the financial

384
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,639
impact

385
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,360
all of that very difficult you know

386
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
explained in very difficult terms this

387
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
is actually what i'm trying to say

388
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,839
it is

389
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,839
the basics you know of course i'm

390
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,000
simplifying but it is a lot of times the

391
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,399
basics and if we get them right

392
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,560
we can already fend off a lot of those

393
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,359
cyber attacks

394
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,319
so

395
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,199
oh

396
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
so if we are successful you know you

397
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
could say well what's the gold standard

398
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,680
for us the gold standard is if you

399
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,519
actually have successful operations you

400
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
know we take down infrastructure we go

401
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
after the bad guys you know we seize

402
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,440
their assets and i think one of the best

403
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,519
examples recent examples is the takedown

404
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
of emote in january

405
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,560
this year

406
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
an operation that took more than three

407
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,839
years

408
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
many international partners not just law

409
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
enforcement but also industry academia

410
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,639
working to their coming together

411
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,639
very early start on a day in january you

412
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,279
know four o'clock waiting for one of the

413
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,399
the um the suspects you know to to get

414
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,079
to the office and then it kicked off

415
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
three different teams one just focusing

416
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
on the infrastructure one focusing

417
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,279
on

418
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,959
the the financial aspects among just

419
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
focusing obviously on on the criminals

420
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
and we were able to use new legislation

421
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
in the netherlands to

422
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,519
that would allow them to actually hack

423
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,560
into some of the cmc2 servers and we

424
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
used legislation in germany to and it

425
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,279
was also a novel approach to

426
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
uh seize the actual malware and replace

427
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,320
it with um you know modified code that

428
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
would still report to the sinkhole so we

429
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
would still get the ping but obviously

430
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
would be without

431
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,600
without the malicious part

432
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
and if you think about it emoted you

433
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,519
know for years one of the key threats in

434
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,199
2019 it was estimated that about 61

435
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,519
globally of all emails with a malicious

436
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
attachment were coming through emo ted

437
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
we i think we started i think it was

438
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,680
2018 probably or 17.

439
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
it was the first time we you know we saw

440
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
emoteet at the time it was a small piece

441
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
of malware

442
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,040
and then it developed into i think a

443
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
perfect example of the crime as a

444
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
service model right because that was

445
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
rented out to other criminals and used

446
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
it for instance to distribute

447
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,719
ransomware so huge

448
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,199
success and then of course we had that

449
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,360
you know expectation versus reality i

450
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,399
thought that was quite interesting you

451
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,240
know on the left we said well surely you

452
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
know this this is the command control

453
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
center of of emote you know such a large

454
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
network you know causing all this you

455
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
know hundreds of millions of uh damages

456
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,440
you know being used by that many

457
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,639
criminals you know

458
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
responsible for all these attacks but as

459
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,399
you probably know that was the reality

460
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,519
and it's quite interesting first of all

461
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,639
you see the difference you know because

462
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,639
on the left hand side that's what we

463
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
have to do that's our suck right this is

464
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,079
that's 24 7. you know top experts

465
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
monitoring the threats

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
what they need to do is on the right

467
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
hand side and just put something

468
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,079
together you know obviously knowing what

469
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,199
they're doing

470
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
but being able to control such a large

471
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
network through that equipment you see

472
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
there

473
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,560
of course no time to rest and i'm not

474
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
going to go into great detail but those

475
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,639
as many other examples um like we heard

476
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
already you know we've been like very

477
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
lucky that we've been able to go after

478
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
some ransomware groups and had some

479
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,800
successes there and that's ongoing

480
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
we've had some good successes against

481
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,519
the

482
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,839
dark web vendors and sellers that was a

483
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
follow-up activity but then also in the

484
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
area of

485
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
criminals abusing encrypted

486
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
communication networks we actually had

487
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,040
three successes in a row we had anchor

488
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
chat with sky cc and then adam which i

489
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,399
thought was the most innovative approach

490
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,240
where you know the fbi with some

491
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
partners actually developed the app and

492
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,279
you know

493
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,759
um offered that to to the criminals

494
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
you know take anchor chat

495
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
we are very lucky that we have some of

496
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
the top experts in certain areas such as

497
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
encrypted data at rest or

498
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,360
cryptocurrencies that was a situation

499
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
where we've been able to provide key

500
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,600
service to to the member states to make

501
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
that investigation happen

502
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
well emoted is it down

503
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
nope

504
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,800
right it's coming back

505
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,839
up again

506
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,120
now

507
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,319
it's frustrating of course it's

508
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,839
frustrating because we've invested so

509
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,520
much time and energy in taking it down

510
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,199
but it was to be expected you know i

511
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,880
discussed this with one of my colleagues

512
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
and his you know responses well the race

513
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,439
goes on you know i would just continue

514
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
with that you know game but it just goes

515
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,599
to show you and i mean it's very hard to

516
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,240
eradicate also actually the um you know

517
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
the the software the infrastructure

518
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
because there is a huge incentive for

519
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,160
cyberknife to get into that space

520
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,720
because it's typically low risk high

521
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
high

522
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
profit a high profit

523
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,840
uh business

524
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,679
now this is not the second time where we

525
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,520
ever so slightly disagree

526
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
or push back whatever you want to call

527
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,559
with bob and you know this is really

528
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
meant as a joke

529
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
now when it comes to public private

530
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
partnership and actually trying to

531
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,760
prevent a cybercrime cybercriminality

532
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
from happening that to us is

533
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
the platinum standard if you will

534
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
and first of all it's a platform

535
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
standard for those like we i mentioned

536
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
before you know this um you know the the

537
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,559
high volume

538
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
criminality that is very hard to

539
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
investigate or we simply don't have the

540
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
resources to do that but in general

541
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
especially also when it comes to

542
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
ransomware if we can help victims and we

543
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,720
can help to prevent or to you know

544
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
mitigate the attack that's where you

545
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
know that's the sweet spot

546
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
and the normal ransom initiative and who

547
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,799
in this room is actually aware of the

548
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,400
normal ransom initiative you probably

549
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
are

550
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
good good good that's good and thank you

551
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
for all of you who are supporting it

552
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
because we have about 170 different

553
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
partners

554
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
now it's true of course i mean the

555
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
latest ransomware it's

556
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,360
let's let's put it you know frankly it's

557
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,400
going to be unlikely they're going to

558
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
find you know immediately a key to

559
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
decrypt that but there have been cases

560
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
we've been you know able to very in a

561
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
very timely manner to provide

562
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
um the

563
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,799
decryption keys decryption tools for

564
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
even very you know new ransomware

565
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,760
families this was established about five

566
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,679
years ago but more than five years ago

567
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,600
with kaspersky

568
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,360
mcafee i don't know if kaspersky is

569
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
still in the room

570
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,280
and and um the dutch police and the idea

571
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,799
was about we need to have a platform but

572
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,400
we can where we can you know provide

573
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
victims with uh with the solutions and

574
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
then you know fast forward five years

575
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,440
later we have a platform available in 37

576
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
different languages like i said more

577
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
than 170 different partners but most

578
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,080
importantly 120 different tools that are

579
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,200
currently decrypt 150 different

580
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
ransomware families

581
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
in july we had the fifth anniversary

582
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
we've been able and this is a very

583
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,679
conservative estimate we've been able to

584
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,080
help 6.2 million victims and that's just

585
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
in individuals this is whole

586
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
organizations and we've been able to

587
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,880
prevent more than 900 million us dollars

588
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,799
um friends from our payments going into

589
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,000
the hand of criminals i think that's a

590
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
huge success of course it's you know

591
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
it's challenging we need to adapt but i

592
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
think you know if you come together for

593
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,000
the greater good this is what we can

594
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
achieve

595
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,799
and all of you you can actually become

596
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
you know a law enforcement officer you

597
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,640
can start helping us and that's another

598
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
area where we try to sort of you know be

599
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
innovative and that's our stop child

600
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,760
abuse the trace and object initiative

601
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
this is an era where you know all the

602
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
experienced

603
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,799
investigators you know they look at the

604
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
child sexual material they can't even

605
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,320
place the image they don't know where

606
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,679
the video was taken but the image was

607
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,559
taken you know so we started um

608
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,880
with that initiative and we we extracted

609
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
certain parts of the image like you know

610
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
a t-shirt a shoe

611
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
you know the background

612
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
and put this online

613
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,520
and to me

614
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
the the left two numbers are the most

615
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,159
important ones you know we've been able

616
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
to you know identify five project

617
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
because most importantly we've been able

618
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,480
to rescue 23 children those are the

619
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,120
latest figures just we have a pr oh

620
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
thank you that's you also yeah

621
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
well that's for all of us thank you very

622
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
much you know we've received more than

623
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
27 000 tips

624
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,559
this is the latest press release days

625
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,000
it's out today

626
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
and think about it those 23 children we

627
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
we've not been able to rescue without

628
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,840
the help of the public

629
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
and we have another a lot of other you

630
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
know prevention arrest materials so the

631
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
left of boom idea all of that is

632
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
available on our website in different

633
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,760
languages you know this idea to actually

634
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
you know educate young people educate

635
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,000
you know the general public how you can

636
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
protect yourself what are the threats in

637
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,159
in simple terms in their language so for

638
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,840
us that's hugely important and we

639
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
wouldn't be able to do this without our

640
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
help with the input from industry from

641
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
academia to understand how we can best

642
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
design those things

643
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
so just looking ahead you know we do a

644
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,240
lot of forward-looking analysis

645
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,080
all these reports again are available on

646
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
our website so the idea is again to

647
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
understand you know what's coming our

648
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
way in terms of new technology what are

649
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,000
the challenges what are the

650
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,200
opportunities

651
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
so if you're interested um that report i

652
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,679
think is quite good because it has sort

653
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,360
of five main categories where we talk

654
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
about loss of data loss of location

655
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
international cooperation cross-border

656
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,520
corporation legislation challenges in

657
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
that regard so you see sort of the main

658
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
categories and what you know the the

659
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,559
various different

660
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
detailed um

661
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
challenges are in that in that regard

662
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
we have now for the third time published

663
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
our observatory function report on

664
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,280
encryption

665
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
anything you want to know about you know

666
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
the latest developments such as

667
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
oblivious dns over https

668
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
uh homomorphic encryption using ai to

669
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
crack encryption or improve encryption

670
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
quantum encryption it's there it's

671
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,440
explained in terms that you can

672
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,280
understand it and again we're looking at

673
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,919
the threats the potential abuse but also

674
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,679
the opportunities again you can download

675
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,880
us that from our website this is

676
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
something i i co-authored with professor

677
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,000
mary aiken and there it's a position

678
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
paper where we said well you know

679
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
there's the blue line the concept of a

680
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
blue line and we said well how do we who

681
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
decides where to draw the blue line in

682
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,000
cyberspace you know where is safety and

683
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
security um you know who's responsible

684
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,919
for that and basically the message it's

685
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,320
a collective discussion that is that we

686
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
need to have so i invite you also to

687
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,120
look at that and participate in the

688
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,600
discussion then as a last example this

689
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,039
is something we

690
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,840
we

691
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,440
drafted together with uh it was actually

692
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
bob and his team and unicre on the

693
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
malicious users and abuses of artificial

694
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,760
intelligence which was a very innocent

695
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
question i got about one and a half

696
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,880
years ago from a journalist and i said i

697
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,200
have no idea so we looked at it and i

698
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,159
think it's quite interesting it's a

699
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,520
little bit gloomy but we have a number

700
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,840
of recommendations because the basic uh

701
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
message is that and i think that goes

702
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
for my inter entire presentation is yes

703
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
there's a lot of risks there's a lot of

704
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
bad things happening but

705
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,520
there's so much potential in cyberspace

706
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
right and artificial intelligence for

707
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
good there's so much potential we just

708
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,799
need to know the risks we need to build

709
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
systems that are robust

710
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,600
that are ethical that are unbiased so we

711
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,960
need to understand what the risks are

712
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
and how criminals are using ai and will

713
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,440
be attacking ai systems to build those

714
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
systems and of course you know they do

715
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
we have 2019 um the first case where

716
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
somebody used a publicly available tool

717
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
to emulate the voice of a ceo to have a

718
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,400
successful co attack about two weeks ago

719
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,760
um i had i had um you know attended a

720
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,039
meeting i was sitting next to a board

721
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
member and we're talking about this and

722
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,840
said yeah happened to me two weeks ago

723
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
they spoofed my number and then called

724
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,520
two of our partners here in spain and in

725
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,120
the u.s so it's happening this is not

726
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,440
sci-fi this is happening as we speak we

727
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
had the case where you know some mp's

728
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
thought it was speaking to the chief of

729
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,320
staff from navalny but apparently that

730
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
was a deep deep fake so this is you know

731
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
if you look at this i you probably know

732
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,919
that website but i love it you know

733
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,520
where you see

734
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,919
thanks where you know you can see those

735
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,400
two faces one of them is completely

736
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,080
synthetical you know created from

737
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
scratch i'll give you a second to look

738
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,919
at those two faces

739
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,799
which one do you think is real

740
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,840
yeah true so it's the yeah the right one

741
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
uh but you know if you think about that

742
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
that means in terms of you know

743
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,600
identity management know your customer

744
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
i've seen um proof of concepts where in

745
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
in real time they've been able to

746
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,559
manipulate videos so a lot of those

747
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,240
standards that we have you know in this

748
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,760
space for instance for banks when you

749
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
create online accounts you know

750
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,840
we need to come up with new ways of

751
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,000
testing those images and videos to spot

752
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
whether those are deep fakes or not so

753
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
this really gets me to the end you know

754
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
where the question was so are we doing

755
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
it right

756
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,360
honestly from where i stand i think

757
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,360
we've come a very long way we're doing

758
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,200
it right because we're working together

759
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,279
we're coming together but having said

760
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
that i think we need to become even

761
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,000
better

762
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,679
we need to become more innovative and by

763
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,640
the way you know we do a lot of

764
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
innovation it's just in the interest of

765
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
time we didn't want to dive into that

766
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,679
we've done a lot of interesting work in

767
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,520
that space we need to work with academia

768
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,440
to become more innovative even

769
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
we need to improve our communication our

770
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
collaboration it's challenging you know

771
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,679
somebody wants that you know cooperation

772
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,120
and sharing information is the thoughts

773
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,400
and prayers of the cyber security

774
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,520
industry and it's true we've been

775
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,200
discussing this again it's not a new

776
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,640
concept

777
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
but i think we've come a long way and i

778
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
would like to thank you because a lot of

779
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
you in the room are working closely with

780
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,159
us and together we have you know an

781
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,880
opportunity to make cyberspace safer and

782
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
more secure and with that i'll thank you

783
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,760
[Applause]

784
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,799
three thumbs time for questions

785
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,520
two wins okay

786
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
is bob still here

787
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,200
i think those are you know resonate is

788
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
operational work so uh whatever we do is

789
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,480
mostly focusing on supporting operations

790
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,200
so strategic tactician and operationally

791
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
i would say about 20 20

792
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,880
and of course we have the problem like

793
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,480
everyone else you know what's the how do

794
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,880
you measure the impact of your of your

795
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,240
of your prevention awareness work but

796
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,080
what we typically do is that we work

797
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
with operations so whenever there's a

798
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,679
large for instance money mule actions we

799
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
have regular manual actions last one

800
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,880
support but more than a thousand

801
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,760
different

802
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
banks you know not just within we then

803
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
have a prevention campaign following the

804
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
operational activity in the various

805
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,559
different languages so we also try to

806
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,000
really link it to the operation

807
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,559
activities but i would say about 20

808
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,919
of work this dedicated to prevention

809
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,919
awareness

810
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,960
yeah so i mean that's certainly um

811
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
obviously and bob said that you know i

812
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
mean definitely cryptocurrencies where

813
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,919
where game change when it comes to it

814
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,279
comes around somewhere

815
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,360
i think the volume still is is a

816
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,559
challenge also for criminals because

817
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,600
eventually they want to turn their

818
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
cryptocurrencies into fiat

819
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,919
uh money and that's where it's becoming

820
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,600
a little bit easier if the volume is

821
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
higher but then the ways to split this

822
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,480
up use mixers and tumblers and like i

823
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,880
said you know go from bitcoin to monero

824
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
see cash in the back and you know it's

825
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,120
it's challenging to follow the money but

826
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,399
certainly the volume is is i would say

827
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,679
then a challenge for cyber chronicles

828
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,039
because again they need to get this out

829
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,640
of the system and that's sometimes

830
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
helpful for us

831
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,159
exactly

832
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,399
oh please

833
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
you mean that they allegedly had the key

834
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,919
and were given that today

835
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,240
um

836
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
so the question is but maybe i'm missing

837
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,840
yeah i think that's

838
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,039
you know that's a challenge in general

839
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,159
and i think that's one of the reasons

840
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,240
why normal ransom is not as popular as

841
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,000
it could be because there's obviously a

842
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
whole business model uh out there in

843
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
terms of ransomware mitigation and

844
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
that's where trust comes into play and

845
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,960
that's typically you know a lot of times

846
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,240
we have that problem for instance when

847
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
it comes to releasing press releases you

848
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,360
know they have some countries saying

849
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
well we're so excited you know we're

850
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
going to release that and we're like oh

851
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,440
you know we actually decided to do the

852
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,559
tomorrow or whatever so um

853
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,399
you know a lot of times it helps them to

854
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,919
have jcat and other platforms to

855
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,840
deconflict and coordinate that but we

856
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
can't control this uh all the time it's

857
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
it is what it is i guess

858
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,840
one more question

859
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,320
wrap up now yeah i'm

860
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,919
totally wrapped up

861
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,480
so over time oh my god thank you very

862
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
much
