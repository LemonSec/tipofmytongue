1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,880
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,000
so

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,440
um i have some good news and some bad

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,800
news

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,880
good news is if you're only playing half

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
attention today you should know a bit

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
more about ransomware as you leave

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,880
bad news is is um i'm talking more about

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,880
ransomware um and there's actually quite

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,000
a bit of overlap with some of the

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
presentations that came on earlier um

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,199
some of that bad news is the speakers we

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
don't really know uh who else is going

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,640
to be presenting what or to what level

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
of content they're going to go to so you

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
will see some laps i've like any good

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,000
pre-sales engineer tried to adjust on

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
the fly so there'll be perhaps some more

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,120
technical and hopefully some more

20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
tactical approaches that you can take

21
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
away from this presentation um but

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
further ado uh let's let's dig into it

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
so when we talk about um setting the

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,000
scene and again i'm not going to go back

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,920
way back in time but certainly if we

26
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,920
think about the revolution or evolution

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
of ransomware over the last few years

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,719
and when i said last few years i'm

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,800
really talking sort of 2015 through to

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,199
2019 with a real peak kind of around the

31
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,920
2017 timeline um certainly driven by by

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,079
groups like lockheed et cetera but that

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
evolution really is driven by this kind

34
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
of um you know automated uh send and

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
receive um you know it was kind of hit

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
and miss depending on the impact of who

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
was a recipient of that message how well

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
they could protect themselves against it

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,360
how well they could recover should they

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
get infected um and that really kind of

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
set the scene for that initial um

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,759
evolution of ransomware when we look at

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,920
that today um and we back that up by

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
some of the proof points

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
if i'm working there we go

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,920
threat metadata is you know as i say

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
kind of since 2017 this is really where

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
we saw this kind of first stage message

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,119
delivery

50
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,560
and to really clarify the point when i

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
taught first stage delivery this is i

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,720
receive a word document it has a macro i

53
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,520
enable the macro i hate ransomware

54
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
that evolution really now has shifted to

55
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,040
actually what we receive now is some

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
kind of initial access again as part of

57
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,759
this

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
kind of breakup and delineation and

59
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,079
speciality of the different players

60
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
within that ransomware sort of cycle

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,479
and that really can

62
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
evolve to sort of up to 12 parties we've

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
seen who can have really specific roles

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
within initial access privilege

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,079
escalation

66
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
destruction within the environment to

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
ensure that the payload is successful

68
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,038
and right through then to the ransomware

69
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,230
deployment itself

70
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,160
[Music]

71
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
but i guess if we also look into um and

72
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
you know this is where i've adapted a

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
little bit from the conversation earlier

74
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,760
where we talk about how the threat

75
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
actors are looking to you know

76
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
understand a bit more about who they're

77
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,599
going after and how they're going to be

78
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,920
successful obviously in 2020 we really

79
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
saw a shift as people went to work from

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
home and as blue teams we needed to move

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,480
from probably a more device focused

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,840
defence posture to more of a

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
people-centric approach in terms of how

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,080
we would look to defend our teams and

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,519
our organizations

86
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,040
the bad news though is unfortunately the

87
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
bad guys were kind of already there

88
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
we've seen them quite regularly and

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
frequently look to open source platforms

90
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
social media being a key one of those um

91
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,879
to really understand you know who are

92
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,400
the people they're going after within an

93
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
organization and what's the most likely

94
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,319
message that's going to resonate when

95
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,680
they send potentially a spearfishing

96
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,400
email into those individuals obviously

97
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,440
as part of that they're looking for it

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
to blend into normal business as usual

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
type messaging

100
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
and so in that they're really looking to

101
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
that people-centric focus and when

102
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,840
they're looking to shift

103
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,959
ransomware payloads

104
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,640
so i'm going to talk through an example

105
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
here this is a real world example the

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
organization is not necessarily

107
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
important um although if you've been

108
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,519
following ransomware news through the

109
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
numbers you may be able to tell exactly

110
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,840
who it is i'm talking to but this was a

111
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,720
uk fashion retailer um

112
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
beginning of this year um who

113
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
unfortunately um was uh yeah uh suffered

114
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,799
a ransomware incident

115
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,400
um as we as we kind of flow through this

116
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
and i'll speed this up because a little

117
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,120
bit was covered earlier but in this

118
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
example we had a phishing email that had

119
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
a word document through to it

120
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,480
went through a number of people in the

121
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
organization some of those individuals

122
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
received the message and unfortunately

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,120
enabled macros macros we still see today

124
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
is the number one way that certainly

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,799
when we deal with attachment based

126
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
attacks um you know the bad guys are

127
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,879
looking to get that first stage payload

128
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,239
onto the machines

129
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
now it's not unfortunate as black and

130
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
white as you would certainly tell me to

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
say let's disable macros let's not allow

132
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
macros to be used in the estate but of

133
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,439
course we know that a number of business

134
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,439
processes can be aligned to those macros

135
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
and they can be very hard to unpick so

136
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,880
yes we need to operate in that

137
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
environment the good news is and this is

138
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,479
uh just a quick shout out to something

139
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,720
that came out last week um so antonov

140
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
ruski does an amazing talk on youtube as

141
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
part of the sans team and even share

142
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
some free

143
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
you know sysmon configs

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
that you can go and access and to be

145
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
able to baseline macros within your

146
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
estate and then start to understand

147
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,440
which are being used for nefarious

148
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,639
processes

149
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,240
and which are actually potentially just

150
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
you know working with trusted uh file

151
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
shares as an example so just quick shout

152
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,360
out for that

153
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
but anyway back to our story so macros

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
enabled and in this example baseloader

155
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
was the the initial payload of choice

156
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,639
that went down to those machines what we

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
see is these loaders baseloader guloder

158
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
z-loader

159
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
are this new multiple flexible delivery

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
method that the bad guys are using for

161
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
this initial access stage

162
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,880
what that means is that they can

163
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
understand a good bit about the

164
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
environment and then understand what's

165
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,759
the next best step that they can do but

166
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
also when they come to sell on this

167
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
access potentially they can really have

168
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,199
an informed sales book to say this is

169
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
the organization this is the type of

170
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,479
software they're running and this is

171
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,520
what you're going to be up against when

172
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
you start to get into the environment

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
um one i'll just pause here one second

174
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,000
one one thing we quite often hear from

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
customers is they say you know also

176
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
we're we're worried about ransomware our

177
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
cso our management teams they're asking

178
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,039
us how are we defending our against

179
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,639
ransomware how are we doing and they

180
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
look in the console be that proof point

181
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
or another vendor and actually when they

182
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
look at their email they're not seeing

183
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
ransomware detections

184
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,240
and the reason for this is this shift

185
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
exactly um so what they're seeing is if

186
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
you look and pivot those reports to

187
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,720
loaders to to cred steelers and to

188
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
banking trojans actually what we see

189
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,319
nine times out of ten so those are the

190
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
type of first infections on email that

191
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
would subsequently lead to ransomware so

192
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
again if you're doing those sorts of

193
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,800
reports you're trying to answer those

194
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
questions

195
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
look for those type of uh type of

196
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
payloads

197
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
so um bazelod goes onto the machine as i

198
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,039
mentioned it does a number of bits of

199
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,639
harvesting uh information from the

200
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,800
estates again operating system software

201
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
installed what wi-fi networks am i

202
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,280
connected to ssids et cetera anything

203
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
that's really going to tell me what's

204
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
the organization i'm on and then what's

205
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
the potential propensity how to say this

206
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
time of afternoon for them to pay um so

207
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,199
gather that information shift it back

208
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,639
out to the bad guys

209
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,240
the actor at this point if they're in

210
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
initial access um broker is then going

211
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
to package that up and sell it onto the

212
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
highest bidder one thing we do

213
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
unfortunately see here is that quite

214
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
often uh that can be sold to multiple

215
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
bidders um so actually again we then see

216
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
that next stage can and has accelerated

217
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
as you'll see in this story um because

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
potentially if that's been sold on

219
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
multiple times it really is then a race

220
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
for the ransomware as the service groups

221
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
to get in launch their payload uh and be

222
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
the ones to claim victory so to speak

223
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
so in this example cobalt strikes can be

224
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,759
pushed down again it's been talked about

225
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,440
earlier but for those in case you aren't

226
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,800
aware cobalt strike is a commercially

227
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
available tool quite often used by red

228
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
teamers and simulations um but

229
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
unfortunately is now being used us

230
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
against us

231
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
um one thing i would say on cobot strike

232
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
is it's very flexible it's able to do a

233
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
lot of things for a lot of reasons

234
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,199
but quite often in some of these attacks

235
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,800
we actually see it being used in default

236
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
modes and so again depending on what

237
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
type of edr or detection tools you've

238
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,759
got

239
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
if you tune those to focus on the

240
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,440
default configurations for cobot strike

241
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
you can have quite high fidelity

242
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
detections um based on that kind of

243
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
setup

244
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
so

245
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
in here once it's landed it's looking to

246
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
move laterally obviously we're trying to

247
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
find accounts of privilege within the

248
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
domain once they're found in this

249
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
example the server admin and taking

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,599
those credentials either dumping them

251
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,440
key loggers etc

252
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,520
escalating that privilege to be able to

253
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
um pivot more

254
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
once that machine and that credential is

255
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,479
then owned again moving throughout the

256
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
estate much wider again though a big

257
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,479
shift that we've seen is really how do

258
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,319
they um you know block the recovery

259
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,919
methods that you would typically use to

260
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,160
get out from ransomware in this example

261
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
you know looking at backup servers

262
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,759
removing snapshots um you know we've

263
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
seen advertisers on on dark webs looking

264
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
for you know for instance being backup

265
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
specialists because they want to

266
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
understand exactly how they're going to

267
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
disrupt that part of the organization in

268
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
order to maximize the the effects

269
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
um so

270
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
gather as much confidential information

271
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,720
as they can what they believe they can

272
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
then sell on in this example it was

273
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
about 200 gigs worth of data that was

274
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
shipped externally again you've heard

275
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
dns ftp are key things to look at there

276
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
we've worryingly seen a few shifts

277
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
towards more g suite office 365 if

278
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,519
they're understanding that they're a g

279
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,120
suite house or whatever again trying to

280
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
hide that traffic in plain sight

281
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,559
um but then once that data has been

282
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,080
export traded it's them you know what

283
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
what's the ransomware payload in this

284
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
example it was conti

285
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
conti i'm sure is probably again well

286
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,200
known in this room but again it's been a

287
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
tool that's been updated a few times

288
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
unfortunately to you know really trigger

289
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
the performance in here so it's a highly

290
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,720
multi-threaded

291
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
approach um that can be used to do

292
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
things like off box encryption tools uh

293
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,279
for um those data stores

294
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,959
so this one comes down the wire we get

295
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,959
our typical kind of ransomware notice um

296
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,320
although interesting point whilst this

297
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,839
is just a straight notepad we've seen

298
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
some sort of weird blurring between pop

299
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
culture and ransomware notice any rick

300
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,519
and morty fans in here might know what

301
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,000
i'm talking about there um but uh yeah

302
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
ransomware payload comes down and then

303
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,959
you know they're they're triggered to

304
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
have that conversation

305
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
um this is actually a transcript um that

306
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
was um subsequently leaked by computer

307
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,279
weekly um after the incidents to save

308
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,800
you reading it all off summarized but

309
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,560
essentially again it gives an insight

310
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
into how they're

311
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,839
taking these types of approaches

312
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,120
the initial ransomware that was

313
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
requested was eight million dollars um

314
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
now this happened during covid's like i

315
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
say to a retail organization so their

316
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
initial response was we're a retail

317
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
outfit due to covid we're only getting

318
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,480
about 25

319
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
um of our typical income uh so trying to

320
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
negotiate that payment down

321
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
um and again this is where then the data

322
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
exfiltration part comes into play and

323
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
because the bad guys basically said give

324
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,360
us a minute we'll go through your data

325
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
they went through the data came back and

326
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,480
said look actually when we look at your

327
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
cyber insurance documents we can see

328
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
you've got a seven and a half million

329
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
pounds coverage better talk to you and

330
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,640
cyber insurers

331
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,160
um so this then carried on and

332
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,040
eventually unfortunately the

333
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,720
organization paid um actually turned out

334
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,959
to be about two million dollars um to

335
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,440
get data back um but again to echo the

336
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
message that we heard earlier just

337
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,959
because you pay these are still bad guys

338
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
so there was a big disruption to this

339
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
organization virtual machines a number

340
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
of impacts that bad guys claimed to have

341
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
nothing to do with um still still put

342
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,640
the business uh into a bad position for

343
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
quite some time

344
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,600
but again one thing we've seen that

345
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
shift is this initial access data

346
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
exfiltration to then the the conte

347
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
ransomware being deployed with seven

348
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
days uh and again that that time frame

349
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,120
we've seen sped up over uh over this

350
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,910
evolution

351
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,000
[Music]

352
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,839
not all bad news um and some interesting

353
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,440
things again for you blue teamers um

354
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
again you may have seen this in the

355
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
summer um so there's some interesting uh

356
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,399
arguments that happen between the conti

357
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
gangs that actually read to one of the

358
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
internal

359
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
affiliates leaking a number of

360
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
attributes online this included tools

361
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
that they were using as well as the

362
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
playbooks and very interestingly a

363
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
cobalt strike user manual which again if

364
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
you're interested you can find some

365
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
great red teaming puller parts on

366
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
youtube that walk you through this and

367
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
give you some really great artifacts in

368
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,680
terms of how they're playing it but this

369
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
is covering everything from you know

370
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,839
initial access um through to how you're

371
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,200
going to find the confidential data

372
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
within the organization disabling of

373
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
certain endpoint technologies and then

374
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
exfiltration of data so again gives you

375
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,440
a really good visibility into

376
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
how they're approaching it

377
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
i won't hammer this point but again we

378
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
talked about double extortion earlier

379
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,120
today again double and triple extortion

380
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,959
unfortunately is something we've seen so

381
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,279
again to summarize that approach where

382
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,720
if you're not going to pay to unencrypt

383
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,399
your data then actually we'll look to

384
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,680
data leakage

385
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
hosting their own sites where again

386
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
maybe they're initially drip feeding

387
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
some initial kind of files to show that

388
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
we mean business unfortunately even

389
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,480
naming individuals into some of those

390
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
drip feeds to try and again trigger an

391
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
emotive response again my takeaway from

392
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,839
this has been talked about earlier is

393
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
really define that plan define your

394
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
response without the emotion of this

395
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
going on in the background

396
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
unfortunately i have been involved in in

397
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
some some incident response to some of

398
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
these scenarios and again it's you know

399
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,560
at that time you need a very clear and

400
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,639
decisive plan uh that doesn't have

401
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,560
emotion tied into it

402
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
um uh so yeah really summarize again

403
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
this kind of cottage industries uh

404
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,480
turned up where again just because

405
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
you're targeted by a particular threat

406
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
actor and the numbers that the proof

407
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
point track on the left here doesn't

408
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
necessarily mean you're going to be hit

409
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,200
by a certain strain of malware or even a

410
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
certain strain of ransomware because of

411
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
that quite often what we find is that

412
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
someone upstream has just found a

413
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
particular good access point and is then

414
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
selling it onto the same game time and

415
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
time again kind of having a trusted

416
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
relationship so to speak

417
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,680
if we look at some proof point data

418
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,440
around this um firstly sort of file

419
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,200
types and patterns probably no surprises

420
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
to you in terms of the file types again

421
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,560
as i talked to earlier those kind of

422
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,200
office documents macro enabled um still

423
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,040
very much a weapon of choice um for the

424
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
bad guys

425
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,200
um

426
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
any guesses as to what the red lines

427
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
might focus on i'll give you the first

428
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,440
one

429
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,760
so time of day again we very much see

430
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,480
this kind of you know initial launch of

431
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
attacks um on the east coast um you know

432
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
talking asia pacific and then following

433
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
the sun out through to the west coast of

434
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
america as it goes

435
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,170
and that second one any guesses

436
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,720
[Music]

437
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
weekends yeah bad guys take the weekends

438
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
quite often friday as well uh three day

439
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,160
weeks

440
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
and say they're lazy but uh but yeah um

441
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
but but certainly again

442
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
the thing we're seeing here is is really

443
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
they are trying to again blend into

444
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,600
business noise right so again if if i'm

445
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
trying to go about my business i'm

446
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
typically receiving invoices because i'm

447
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
in finance as an easy example if i make

448
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
sure that my malware is going in at that

449
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
time and we're really reducing the time

450
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
from sending to the time from that end

451
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
user receiving and hopefully interacting

452
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
from their perspective then then that's

453
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,600
going to be all the more effective for

454
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,340
the bad guys

455
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,240
[Music]

456
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
probably no surprises malicious urls

457
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,079
really continue to dominate the uh the

458
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
landscape and the the numbers that you

459
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
see here in the dark blue bars are the

460
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,639
urls uh light blues much lower down are

461
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,399
then the use of attachments again still

462
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
prevalent but very much url specific

463
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
again what you'll probably already know

464
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,720
but it's bang for their buck it's much

465
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
easier it's much quicker to spin off and

466
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
generate unique urls necessarily than it

467
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
is to do the unique attachments

468
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,440
if we look at some of these examples

469
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
that we've taken recently and some

470
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
different trends that we've seen

471
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,079
job applications probably nothing new

472
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
there but the encrypted part of this is

473
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,279
something again that we've seen popping

474
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
up more and more um so in here you can

475
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,720
actually if you can't make that out but

476
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
it's actually the passwords included in

477
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,199
the email

478
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,480
again just trying to allow people to

479
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,399
open and then lo and behold um looking

480
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,199
to trigger the macros

481
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
social engineering to weaponize staff um

482
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
so being able to offer them a piece of

483
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
the pie you know in this example we'll

484
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
give you a million bitcoins if you

485
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,399
actually just run our malware or if you

486
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
open an rdp connection uh that we can

487
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,920
utilize to drop the ransomware into the

488
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,279
organization

489
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
obviously this was you know something

490
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
that was highlighted as part of a tesla

491
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,199
breach where they were trying to bribe

492
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
an insider but again seems to be a

493
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,360
continuing trend

494
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
and this was an interesting one for us

495
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
because it kind of took away some of the

496
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,199
typical playbooks that we see from from

497
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
the ransomware teams this was a fake

498
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,279
movie site that was stood up bravo

499
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,320
movies

500
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,760
and again in terms of what we typically

501
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
see it's the least amount of interaction

502
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,720
the end user has to do from when they

503
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,399
receive the mail to when they trigger

504
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,240
the payload but this actually was quite

505
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
a convoluted step essentially what you

506
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
would get was a message to say that

507
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,279
you've signed up to bravo movies you've

508
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,040
got our free trial but your free trial

509
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
is now expired we're now going to start

510
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
charging your card for the subscription

511
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
of course there's then contacts that you

512
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,519
can call should this be a malicious

513
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,199
thing and you didn't create it

514
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,800
and even a very helpful website that you

515
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
can go to looking quite professional in

516
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,199
nature um even having some fake movies

517
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
uh that they created along with reviews

518
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
and other things to boot

519
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
and the way that this played out was

520
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,519
essentially you go to the frequently

521
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,120
asked questions you'd find a hotline

522
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
number you'd ring the hotline number

523
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,680
endure some very interesting jazz music

524
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,279
and then on from that you get through to

525
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
an operator who again very professional

526
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,199
would ask for the subscription id number

527
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,880
you received in the email that again is

528
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,199
unique to the recipients in order to try

529
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,800
and sort of prove some validity what

530
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
they would do is then take that

531
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
subscription number and then play back

532
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
to the individual oh yes this is your

533
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,199
email address this is your name this is

534
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,480
your information now some of that

535
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
information may be false just again to

536
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
try and show that it was a you know it

537
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,759
wasn't a genuine subscription um but

538
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,279
then what they would do is they would um

539
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
take them onto a website where um on

540
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,560
that website again they'll be asked for

541
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
the subscription id they would enter it

542
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
often staying on the phone with uh with

543
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
the uh the hotline and then download an

544
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
excel file this excel file is per you

545
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,600
know was kind of positioned to be we

546
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
need your cancellation number so you

547
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,120
need to run it obviously enabling macros

548
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,279
again as they do that um at which point

549
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
again then the machine is going to start

550
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,759
getting that payload

551
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,279
this was another example of the same

552
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
thing i won't comment on music taste but

553
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
again you knew reference numbers coming

554
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,519
out um that the message here really is

555
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,800
is that again that

556
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,920
they're playing to things that are

557
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
happening in the news this was obviously

558
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,199
as justin bieber i believe was doing a

559
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,120
concert but at the same time you know

560
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,799
around valentine's day we see flowers

561
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,959
and chocolates you know again much more

562
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,880
again trying to fit in with the sorts of

563
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,280
um things happening in society

564
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,039
um and again of course you know we're

565
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,559
concerned for your security so here's

566
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,960
that phone number to contact

567
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,199
[Music]

568
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,599
now this is where hopefully

569
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,880
again as a vendor i don't want to i

570
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
don't want to push flood but again i

571
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
want to break the numbers down for you

572
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,000
um this is some very interesting data

573
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
from cove where cover is an organization

574
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
that we partner with and they do some

575
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,240
really good ransomware quarterly reports

576
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,600
that you can access and get very

577
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
interesting data with online

578
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
and as part of that they've kind of you

579
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,919
know looked at the attack vectors and

580
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,760
you know spread that back over a number

581
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,960
of years

582
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,400
hopefully the colors come through but

583
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,919
you know the primary one there as you

584
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,400
again heard earlier rdp brute forcing

585
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,320
rdp is the easiest way that they will

586
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,840
get into your network if you have that

587
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
on the edge if you haven't got that from

588
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,320
today please please take that away um

589
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
and then the next after that again email

590
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,919
is still the number one threat vector so

591
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,360
this is where we see

592
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,039
email being the next target because

593
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,400
unfortunately people will still click

594
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
links they'll still open attachments and

595
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,720
they'll still enable those macros

596
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,919
last but not least though and this is

597
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,760
definitely still being used is patching

598
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,120
and vulnerabilities on those edge

599
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
devices um again a shout out to um to

600
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
something that was

601
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,760
popped up on my twitter feed recently

602
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
and thanks and credit to alan liske for

603
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
this

604
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
but this is looking at the cves that

605
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
being used in the wild by the ransomware

606
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
teams based off of the type of edge

607
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,720
device that you've got and some some

608
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
great intelligence out there in the

609
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,760
community that you can use to again just

610
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
prioritize that uh response and make

611
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
sure that again it's it's not patch

612
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,840
everything but it's prioritized and it's

613
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
in that approach

614
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
now i am an email nerd so i'm afraid it

615
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
would be remiss of me not to talk a

616
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,360
little bit more on email uh sad as that

617
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,679
is but uh you know again be this proof

618
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
point be this any any other vendor i

619
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
want to talk to i think the evolution of

620
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
defense in depth just within email

621
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
itself um an email gateway yes has multi

622
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
layers and multi other things and

623
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
hopefully you have a strong one backed

624
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,559
by good intelligence to remove the

625
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,039
majority of of that content but

626
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,200
nonetheless i think sandboxing you know

627
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
again should hopefully be a table stake

628
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,320
alongside that certainly from an

629
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
attachment perspective but again looking

630
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
to that to urls being able to follow

631
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
those through to final payloads is also

632
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,840
key

633
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
definitely not to be missed is the

634
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,520
security and end user awareness

635
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,120
again you know helping people not to

636
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,640
click those links to understand the

637
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
attachments to really understand what

638
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,320
the bad guys are looking to do um just

639
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
by a few clicks of their mouse um not

640
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
only to try and remove and stop them

641
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
from doing that but also to notify right

642
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
so back to that response piece

643
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
you know if they can be your first line

644
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,720
of defense um to be able to spot

645
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
something highlight it to you and then

646
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,280
use a uh automated response to then go

647
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
into your 365 or other mail platform and

648
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,440
remove any artifacts that contain the

649
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,799
same information is also key and last

650
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,400
and definitely not least isolation i

651
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,679
think has come on a long way as a

652
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
technology and a capability the end user

653
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,000
experience is you know to most

654
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
unrecognizable in terms of the

655
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,559
differences

656
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,320
but again in terms of that post delivery

657
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,919
and weaponizing of content once it's

658
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,320
already in the user's inbox isolation is

659
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
a great way to remove that you know

660
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
shift the payload

661
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
detonation and everything happens within

662
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
the isolation chamber completely away

663
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,280
from the end user's machine and again

664
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,960
depending on when that gets weaponized

665
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
persistent link has been rewritten to to

666
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
remove all of that content

667
