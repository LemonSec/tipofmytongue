00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:09,690
good morning and thank you Gordon an

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,660
apologies up front I I have a really bad

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,219
voice and so I thought I'd actually have

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,199
to stand up here with hand signals but

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,990
thankfully presentation decks are really

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,140
good for this so look as I'm delighted

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,820
to be here and I'm here because I sit on

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,269
the steering group of technology Ireland

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,220
ICT skill net and in particular I chair

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,570
the advisory board for the CSI

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,040
initiative which is really what I'm

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,930
going to talk to you about this morning

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,980
and in addition I sit on the board of

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,110
cyber Ireland so were they part radula P

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,489
oh dear what a type of - sorry

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,569
stay away from that sack for thinking

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,569
[Music]

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,589
[Music]

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,980
you can see where I taught you when your

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,270
career as IBM gets yours oh yeah okay

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,298
that's the bottom Isles okay thank you

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,450
perfect so look I'm gonna take you on a

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,880
little bit of a journey first of all to

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,399
explain well what is technology Ireland

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,130
ICT skill net who are they

26
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:19,229
it's a network of over 400 private

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,380
sector organisations and they

28
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,158
collaborate to determine what skills are

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,429
need to progress their industry and

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,049
particularly if this is the ICT sector

31
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:34,109
so this is where the CSI piece comes

32
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,170
into play it was established in 2005

33
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,780
under the aegis of Technology Ireland

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,049
which is a member of I bet and it's also

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,700
part funded by still net Ireland okay so

36
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,459
to give you that bigger picture skill

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,609
net Arland as an organization has 68

38
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,159
skill Nets and they are broken down by

39
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,958
industry sector and by region and they

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,090
have the same model their industry or

41
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,249
their enterprise lead and Technology

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,039
Ireland ICT skill net is just one

43
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:04,259
network within skill net within the skin

44
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,639
that Ireland brand so to just give you a

45
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,568
sort of a picture of what that looks

46
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:11,670
like so what we do is we provide high

47
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,739
quality and focused education and

48
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,540
training

49
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,310
it's really to keep the organization's

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,250
our member organizations at the

51
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,350
forefront of whatever skills it is they

52
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,640
need so we're constantly looking to the

53
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,380
future and one of the things excuse me

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,929
one of the things that we have done this

55
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,299
year is we actually amalgamated with a

56
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,210
technology Ireland innovation forum so

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,940
this is a new chapter for ICT skill net

58
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,160
and very much one that will allow us to

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,500
start to look more as innovation because

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,750
obviously innovation is huge within the

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,220
ICT sector so bringing that innovation

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,500
and research to our members so the

63
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,900
challenge that we faced and this is

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,110
going back about three years was this

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,940
cyber security skills gap and you know I

66
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,650
can stand up here and tell you we still

67
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,050
have themselves that problem as all of

68
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,010
you probably are very aware but what we

69
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,260
were seeing was the digital

70
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,640
transformation the obliquity of the net

71
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,510
of their web cloud applications and

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,179
organizations finding it really

73
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,239
difficult just to find IT people and

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,410
that just became more compounded when

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,340
you were looking for cyber security

76
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,859
skills yes we were trying to do that in

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,840
the face of organizations really

78
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,580
beginning to become very aware that they

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,230
needed to protect their data so very

80
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,840
much echoing what Brian has said this

81
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,869
morning it is one of the key things

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,970
every organization faces or should be

83
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,730
facing or should be looking at and

84
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,560
skills really forms and having the right

85
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,619
skills actually forms a core component

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,200
of that so we're also seeing increasing

87
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,230
are decreasing unemployment the double

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,540
negative so as our unemployment levels

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,579
go down we're also now focused that

90
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,950
we've got actually less people available

91
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,110
in the workplace and also every

92
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:03,530
organization of fighting for cyber

93
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,330
skills it's not just an IT or a

94
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,190
technology companies problem it's

95
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,959
everybody's got a problem whether you're

96
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,020
a small solicitor's office right through

97
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,420
to a multinational the whole cyber

98
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,250
security business is evolving

99
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,729
excuse me I'm really sorry about this um

100
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:24,510
and you know what we've seen is a 40%

101
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:30,060
increase in cyber roles over the past

102
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:32,190
two to three years so what did we do as

103
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,350
a direct response to that and without an

104
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,080
a direct response to that the massive

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,910
skills issue an organisation's feeling

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,250
that they weren't really adequately able

107
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,290
to protect themselves we launched in

108
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,120
2010 18 the CSI framework which is a

109
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,330
comprehensive plan to train individuals

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,190
in cybersecurity skills and it was

111
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,150
really to help organizations to address

112
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,800
those skills shortages so the first

113
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,870
thing we did was we put an advisory

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,430
board in place I'm not going to name all

115
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,830
of them but I will call out the fact

116
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,669
that Brian is an active member of the

117
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,500
advisory port and this is a group of

118
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,770
enterprises government organizations and

119
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,730
academia which helped us to shape the

120
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:20,840
needs of the industry using all of the

121
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,870
you know constituent parts of government

122
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,320
academia and enterprise so we came up

123
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,810
with a five key or five core strategies

124
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,060
and this is what we see as our road to

125
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,370
excellence so on the bottom left-hand

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,800
corner you've got the cyber skills and

127
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,669
pathway and this is about building

128
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,220
skills building knowledge bringing lots

129
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,770
of different types of programs to play

130
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,530
not just a one-size-fits-all

131
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,359
the second was organic growth and this

132
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,969
is something that we discovered by

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,880
talking to a lot of our clients was that

134
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,400
how do we take people who exist in the

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,620
organization today and upscale them or

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,900
rescale them or retrain them a lot of

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,640
people make decisions around careers at

138
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,289
the point where they leave school but

139
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,140
you may have people in your organization

140
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,810
who are not in an IT role yet actually

141
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,810
have competencies that would make them

142
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,550
really good cyber experts so we actually

143
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,740
started to look at how do you take those

144
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,229
people how do you identify them I'm

145
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,030
using cyber aptitude tests so that you

146
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,919
actually can grow people that exist in

147
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,419
your organization today

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,688
you're going back to what Brian said

149
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:34,109
earlier again this is a business issue

150
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:36,689
not just an IT issue it's not okay to

151
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,599
say oh I've got a business partner they

152
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,000
look after my IT or that's you know we

153
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,159
have a 90 department and they look after

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,169
our security it's everybody's

155
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,699
responsibility but particularly within a

156
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,270
business if that needs to come from the

157
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,009
top down

158
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,870
and I think CEOs and the senior

159
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,289
leadership team needs to be asking the

160
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,590
questions so part of our goal was to

161
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,900
raise the awareness in that area we were

162
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,688
also focused on new entrants so trying

163
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,210
to encourage people to go into cyber

164
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,610
security when they come out of college

165
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,888
or before they even go into college and

166
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,949
particularly to look at and females

167
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,740
coming into the cyber security space and

168
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:20,340
then the final strategy was continuous

169
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,990
development this is really important

170
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,609
we're hearing this in every sector now

171
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,020
that you know lifelong learning is

172
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,939
something that's really important to

173
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,520
regardless of what role you're and what

174
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:32,370
industry rate I think there's no more

175
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,190
important area than in the cyber

176
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,789
security space because your knowledge

177
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,430
your skill it has a really short shelf

178
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,169
life so I think it's really important

179
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,930
though if people continue to grow their

180
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:49,469
professional development that is the

181
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,620
fifth of the key strategies so then

182
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,569
there were five aims that were going to

183
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,330
bring this strategy to life the first is

184
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,949
raising awareness so I lived him back

185
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,240
again to what Brian said I'm really

186
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,599
Lapierre I'm following Brian this

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,189
morning has he had a lot of but of his

188
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,740
comments a lot of his key ideas actually

189
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,659
flow nicely into this is really to raise

190
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,819
that awareness across the board so that

191
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,650
organizations know that they have a

192
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,060
potential issue and they have something

193
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,770
that they need to work on preparing

194
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,789
organizations to be ready for cyber

195
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,830
attacks resilience to grow those skills

196
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:29,120
so that organizations become resilient

197
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,098
and are able to defend themselves

198
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,929
standards to look at standards for

199
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,030
cybersecurity roles and for

200
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,829
cybersecurity training

201
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,919
and then the final piece is automation

202
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,950
where possible to use automation and to

203
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:48,360
use AI to actually help to grow and

204
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:51,420
develop skills in the cyber space so I'm

205
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,790
delighted to say that for 2019 their

206
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,890
cybersecurity skills initiative that

207
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,620
framework has had over a thousand

208
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,500
individuals participate in the programs

209
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,690
that we've developed and over 400

210
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,910
companies have engaged in the framework

211
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,670
as well so in just a 12-month period

212
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,850
it's a really great set of statistics

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,979
for us and that has included a number of

214
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,520
things so the framework itself is a

215
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,050
whole series of different programs so it

216
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,660
is literally everything from basic

217
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,180
awareness training right through to a

218
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,430
master's in cybersecurity which is

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,349
actually run by a technological

220
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:32,729
university Tomblin at the branch it's on

221
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,770
campus so of those 1,000 individuals and

222
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,800
400 companies that participated this

223
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,420
year they engaged in everything from CSI

224
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,640
awareness training which we held

225
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,800
nationally and I can tell you when I saw

226
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,530
the list of the places that this was

227
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,209
rolling out over the year I'm from New

228
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,319
Ross from County Wexford and I saw that

229
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,300
honors and I excellent

230
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,130
crash this is a national program we've

231
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,199
got small little town in the southeast

232
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,180
of Ireland is actually on that the

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,180
program for awareness training and

234
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,640
cybersecurity and we ran a number of CSI

235
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,760
webinars and the commercial cyber

236
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,000
aptitude test or C cache is a set of

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,120
aptitude tests that is produced for the

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,610
commercial organizations are supposed to

239
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,370
defense there is a defense one and

240
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:21,840
that's the technology that we use to

241
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,860
assess people's capability in in cyber

242
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,450
in aspects of cybersecurity and we also

243
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,050
ran a number of information security

244
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,970
passes risk assessments IRAs and capture

245
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,550
the flags we had a number of those that

246
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,890
we ran for organizations and some open

247
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,319
ones around the country as well and

248
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,840
there is one running here today as well

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,790
and then there's the MSC in

250
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,250
cybersecurity which has been running at

251
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,010
a technological university Blanchard

252
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,800
sound for the last

253
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,439
number of years so there are plenty of

254
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,240
details on the all of the programs that

255
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,250
make up the cybersecurity skills

256
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:03,250
initiative on technology and ICT skill

257
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,050
let's website and my colleagues from

258
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,600
there are actually here today so I

259
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,650
certainly would encourage you to to go

260
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,990
along to meet them

261
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,370
not a sales pitch but I think that if

262
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,290
you're wondering about awareness

263
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,100
training if you're wondering about any

264
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:20,770
form of growing skills skills assessment

265
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,930
training please do stop by and have a

266
