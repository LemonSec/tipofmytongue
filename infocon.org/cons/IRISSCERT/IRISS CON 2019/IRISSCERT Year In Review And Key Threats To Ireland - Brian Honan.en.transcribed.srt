1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,090
so good morning everybody and thank you

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,620
for braving the weather I stayed here

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,460
last night so I didn't have much of a

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,439
commute but I believe some of you had to

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:22,189
go through wind and wind and rain and

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,948
everything else to get here so thank you

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,980
for being here as Gordon says this is

8
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:29,929
our 11th year and we're still going

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,060
strong and that's down to you but again

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:35,870
just to reiterate this would not happen

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,900
without our sponsors our research is a

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:43,699
not-for-profit organization we get no

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,390
funding to provide a service 24 by 7 365

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,550
days a year

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:48,470
to the Internet community here in

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,349
Ireland so we can make the internet much

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,310
safer for businesses and individuals in

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,660
this country and to be quite frank also

19
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,860
internationally because we work with

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,480
other sites around the world

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,879
so our sponsors are what keep us alive

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,460
for the rest of the year so please do

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,610
visit them spend some time at the stands

24
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,470
and you know show that sure you

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,480
appreciate appreciating them cuz without

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,730
them we would have a shot shut the doors

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,150
and the service would stop that's

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:22,100
basically how it is so anyway as Gordon

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,230
said traditionally I give you a look

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,070
back as what's happened in the past

31
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:30,230
number years and as always when the

32
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,320
reference I give is is the Verizon data

33
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,409
breach investigations report Verizon as

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,559
you may know is international us-based

35
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,659
company who provide hosting

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,790
telecommunications and consulting they

37
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,280
have been working with organizations all

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,229
around the world the past seven or eight

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,940
years alex foote in one of this because

40
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:55,370
today he's one of the founders of the

41
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:58,759
DPR they take data from organizations

42
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,229
such as the FBI US Secret Service our

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,950
research we provide all information

44
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:05,929
about the instance we are aware of and

45
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,259
many other threats and other companies

46
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:12,310
around the world do the same stuff and

47
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:14,839
Verizon analyzes and give a digestible

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,599
easy-to-read non van

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,030
biased report on what the landscape is

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,160
in cybersecurity and some the key

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,709
takeaways we can think say from the from

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,780
2019 is 69% of all breaches were by

53
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,730
outsiders but should be sipped around

54
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,190
that means if you're responsible cyber

55
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,929
security nearly one-third of your

56
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,930
breaches come from inside the

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,569
organization so I want things we need to

58
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,220
look at a lot of Sophie we always talk

59
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,290
about with cyber security is looking at

60
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,680
the external threat but we've got the

61
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,780
interim creditor to worry about as well

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,670
71% of attacks are financial motivation

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,620
now many people are talking about that

64
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,170
go well we don't worry about that we

65
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,930
don't have credit card data or we don't

66
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,010
have a lot of financial data on our

67
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,260
systems that we don't need to worry

68
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,989
about people have an interest well if

69
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,879
you are familiar with the underground

70
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:14,840
the underground sites that the criminals

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,590
go to online each and every one of us

72
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,299
our data is been sold so your

73
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,709
information your personal data your name

74
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,319
your address your mother's maiden name

75
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,450
your favorite color your first pet dog's

76
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,988
name where you went to scale your first

77
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,089
car all the information is on average we

78
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,060
saw between five to fifteen dollars per

79
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,349
person so information has a value that's

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,810
why criminals are breaking into systems

81
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:42,470
and that's where they go from from an

82
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,829
Irish point of view I had a quick review

83
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,739
of all the issues reported to us so we

84
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,810
get notifications from certs around the

85
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,090
world we get notifications from

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,989
companies like an ugly butt shadow

87
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,239
server Arbor networks the net craft

88
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:01,630
other pieces place it come to us and

89
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,560
with their senses they identify

90
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:09,739
compromised systems in Ireland voluntary

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,450
personally 43,000 in the past 10 was

92
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,910
this up until the beginning November

93
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,488
from damaged first on from that on to

94
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,639
today of 43 thousands because I don't

95
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:21,978
this is these stats yesterday no charge

96
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,659
them are inbound DDoS attacks so

97
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:27,159
descriptive service attacks against

98
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,159
websites hosted here in arms

99
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,370
5,800 nearly 6,000 websites in Ireland

100
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,370
have been compromised by premise to host

101
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,620
phishing websites to steal the personal

102
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,780
data of people elsewhere be they

103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,280
customers of banks or anything else

104
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,960
there were 624 attacks

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,960
identified as coming from the Irish IP

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,448
stat IP space against other systems

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,419
around the world and then we 30 sites

108
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,550
that were hacked to host malicious also

109
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,219
you visit those websites and your system

110
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,130
wasn't hatched I wasn't up two days you

111
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,590
could have been infected with malicious

112
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,360
software also by those who have sites so

113
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,880
that's what's happening in the Irish

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,440
space this is this is a part from what

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,180
you read the newspapers nothing else

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,250
this is yeah on a regular basis but what

117
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,320
we also seen is and we see this and know

118
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,509
my other half is I'm CEO of bh

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,800
consulting and we provide its response

120
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,870
service to our clients this is what

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,970
we're staying in the industry

122
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,300
don't worry about advanced persistent

123
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,949
threats or zero day attacks this is what

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,349
you have to worry about majority of

125
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,030
breaches in Ireland and either hijack

126
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:41,840
cloud-based accounts so abusing the

127
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,789
office 365 that you use in the Amazon

128
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,789
Web Services using Gmail for your

129
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,370
company business if you are relying on

130
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:53,039
your users to protect your corporate

131
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,210
system which is your email system with

132
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,669
just our password

133
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,549
you run a high risk of their account

134
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,889
being compromised in hijack

135
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,659
we see that up this email compromised

136
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,380
and CEO fraud for invoices are being

137
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:09,990
redirected by criminals to compromise

138
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,490
and that's often use in combination with

139
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,520
those hijacked accounts so you would

140
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,800
have a company's email account hijacked

141
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,008
and then invoice has been sent our

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,560
emails been sent from a company to their

143
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,080
suppliers are to their customers asking

144
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,430
them to change any payments to new bank

145
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,190
account and because it comes from a

146
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,720
recognized and trusted email address

147
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,849
hence you get the hijacked accounts back

148
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,400
and then ransomware attacks are the

149
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,630
biggest one there but with all this if

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,489
you look at the Verizon daily beaches

151
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,920
the vestigation reports and when we

152
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,930
follow up on some

153
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,800
we deal with in our research and

154
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,050
everything else this slide is an has

155
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,420
been and every presentation not given at

156
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,700
iris over the past 11 years it's the

157
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,060
same stuff and yes I still have Windows

158
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,710
XP and out happen is XP next year and

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,010
I'll probably up Windows XP in 10 years

160
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,320
time cuz systems are still running well

161
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,719
it's poor passwords so if you've got a

162
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,790
host of cloud systems get multi-factor

163
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,410
authentication turned on especially for

164
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,970
privileged accounts and high-value

165
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,020
accounts that people work in finance or

166
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,310
accounts of whatever's missing patches

167
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,560
since I've been updated fun abilities

168
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,410
out of date so all those websites we

169
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,630
talked about that had hosting phishing

170
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,780
pages are host malicious script are all

171
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,580
down to use an old WordPress installs or

172
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,070
Joomla or stuff that has not been

173
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,710
patched so make sure your systems attach

174
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,680
all the antivirus offer and lack of

175
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,080
monitoring and again something I keep

176
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,130
saying is that you know we keep looking

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,900
at innovation and all the new things

178
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,450
that are happening in cybersecurity for

179
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,880
if you keep making the same mistakes now

180
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,890
that's crazy

181
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,730
we'll do the same stuff over and over

182
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,890
again but kinda maybe looking to the

183
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,350
future Fred oh I see of where do we see

184
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,340
from the search for the main attacks are

185
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,330
gonna happen and where they're going to

186
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,710
come from it's still the same stuff

187
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,690
mister them before passwords is still

188
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,169
gonna be a hijacked accounts patches

189
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,320
emitted etc and that's backed up by the

190
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,150
lives of your paws in tarnish organized

191
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,550
crime threat assessment there are act I

192
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,070
after I oft act is quite hunted

193
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,190
pronounce like he did I oft our report

194
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,260
they produces every year so Europe all

195
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,090
this other concept works with all the

196
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,610
different vendors and inserts and

197
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,609
financial services and telcos

198
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,340
to get a feel what the trends are in

199
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,840
cybersecurity so again this is vendor

200
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,700
neutral it's coming from Europe also

201
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,290
they've no axe to grind they've not

202
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,320
trying to sell you a shiny box or

203
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,329
something to go to the report and you

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,710
can see when the comments there is the

205
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,820
major threats we face today so does

206
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,590
ransomware Arbela

207
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,510
business email compromised happening

208
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,620
around four years or you may see

209
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,810
something quite now

210
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,400
it's more it's more likely than that

211
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,290
cyber criminals will continue refining

212
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,680
attacks I've been shown work

213
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,540
clémence by their nature and kind of

214
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,660
ties into Graham's talk later on are

215
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,520
lazy that's why they're criminals they

216
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,140
will take the easy way out they will

217
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,329
look to get money quite easily and they

218
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,370
can deal quickly and easily that's what

219
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,750
they're gonna do if a scam works or

220
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,870
techniques work they're gonna use it

221
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,580
over and over again the World Economic

222
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,690
Forum this year has identified that

223
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,510
cyber security is one the top tree and

224
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,460
the other can risk most likely to happen

225
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:32,150
to global economy sub security is the

226
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:34,220
number this is number tree the impact

227
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,670
it's going to have if cyber security is

228
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,120
down there at the sixth-largest impact

229
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,010
that it could have on the global economy

230
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,010
we've made attacks so this stuff is no

231
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:49,930
longer most geeks worrying about the in

232
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:53,360
the IT department or whatever this is

233
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,150
attractive not just our computer systems

234
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,810
but to businesses is society and indeed

235
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,490
to democracy as well but criminals are

236
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,989
going to follow the money everyone see

237
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,000
where the trends are going to happen you

238
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,890
just see where the money is going so

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,720
we're still going to see attacks at

240
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,340
crypto jacking and some of those

241
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,150
malicious websites our high tech were

242
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,500
hijacked by premise to insert

243
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,079
scripts and code on a website so that

244
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,670
when you visit us it was in certain code

245
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,770
into your browser so you would mind

246
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,410
cryptocurrency on behalf of the

247
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,480
criminals one of the organizations that

248
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,800
I hit last year in 2018 was the

249
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,100
Information Commissioner's Office in the

250
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,439
UK so you know it can happen to them it

251
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,020
can happen to anybody

252
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,880
we're still going to see CEO fraud on

253
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,560
Cardassia corner there cybercrime unit

254
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,390
they'll probably say this is on the top

255
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,239
trusted and issues they had to deal with

256
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,920
on a regular basis

257
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,900
ransomware is still going to be a big

258
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,479
issue but ransomware is going to mature

259
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,550
it's going to change its going to come

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,440
automated so premise under look at ways

261
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,120
to make it ransomware Warner bugs we've

262
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,090
already seen that with not Pecha and

263
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,000
with one apply what we're Padma see that

264
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,980
happen a lot more also it's going to be

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,610
more targeted

266
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,700
and criminals will look to either ransom

267
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,970
your data enough for you to pay for you

268
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,100
get your data back or depend on your

269
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,370
organization they're going to ask you

270
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,310
for ransom not to release your data

271
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,350
online so that's gonna be a big change

272
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,420
Crimmins gonna realise your information

273
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,120
has value it's valuable to you it's

274
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,890
gonna be back to somebody else so what

275
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,500
would you pay for us enough to put your

276
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,939
your information on the Internet as

277
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,430
opposed to what we pay to get your

278
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:44,000
information back supply chain attacks

279
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,620
again if you look at not paycheck that

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,450
came through the meetups offered the

281
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,730
accounting software that was used very

282
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:54,170
much in Eastern Europe and the Baltic

283
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,980
States which was a genuine accounting

284
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,160
software using many companies the

285
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,010
videographer was company wasn't

286
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,569
compromised those behind the tacular the

287
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,500
US and the UK government's have

288
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,790
identified was the Russian government

289
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,400
inserted malicious software the not

290
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,349
patch of malware into an update so

291
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,590
everybody using the meteos accountants

292
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,200
often got their patch update to say you

293
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,910
need a new patch oh this is from a

294
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,240
trusted source yes we accept the patch

295
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:29,240
we have one client who missed getting

296
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,970
hit by not patches merely because the IT

297
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,520
manager was on a ryanair flight from the

298
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,310
Ukraine - moment to head up on a

299
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,230
bachelor party and because he was in the

300
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,660
flight he couldn't authorize the updates

301
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,580
to the to Demeter chakra but by the time

302
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,360
he arrived he was told don't authorize

303
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:50,330
this change so you know don't come for a

304
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,500
stag party it should not be your is the

305
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:58,750
response strategy for mind you it can

306
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:02,060
help recording doesn't control systems

307
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,650
because we've seen more of the nostra

308
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,050
ketosis and being put online and

309
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,970
connects the internet because it makes

310
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,140
business easier and we can say as

311
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,570
cybersecurity professionals

312
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,189
Oh nobody's air-gap that are weak

313
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,250
do that but the business gonna go well

314
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,560
no we need to do business so get it done

315
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,209
I'll make it secure if you don't make a

316
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,369
scale we're gonna see more ICS systems

317
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:27,800
get compromised IOT devices don't happen

318
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:31,240
yeah we've seen headlines about

319
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,979
companies being compromised by their IOT

320
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,980
smart light poles being compromised and

321
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,800
then using it as a stepping stone into

322
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,420
the the Wi-Fi network for the company

323
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,349
and from there then back into them into

324
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,599
the proper assistance

325
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,230
so all these devices were connecting

326
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:52,370
onto our networks or to our business be

327
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:55,819
they air Internet cameras would be the

328
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,639
smartphones that be they smart cameras

329
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:00,050
light bulbs on whatever else they pull

330
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,380
the risk of need to manage them in

331
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,089
hidden secure there is an increasing

332
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,399
amount of cloud attacks gonna happen and

333
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,230
this is not just going to be hijacking

334
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,490
people's credentials so again if you're

335
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,079
using any cloud services

336
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,540
please look at multi-factor

337
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,959
authentication in place to secure them

338
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,399
better but we are seeing attacks against

339
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,779
hosts and environments and we have seen

340
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:26,500
that happened in the US for example

341
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:33,649
there though a month ago there was a

342
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:35,360
cloud based doctor's software so many

343
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,490
surgeons in the US they were using the

344
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,260
scalp I saw her take a HIPAA ranchmen

345
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,630
and every doctor surgery that was used

346
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,670
that could not use the system so where

347
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,350
has ever seen attacks against the cloud

348
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,550
serves themselves and that's gonna

349
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,620
increase and as we get better at secure

350
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,990
systems humans aggregate targets of

351
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,670
phishing emails social engineering are

352
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,079
going to happen and we were two good

353
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,399
speakers later on today talking about

354
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:04,430
how to manage that trash I'm in premise

355
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:06,740
just like ourselves are using artificial

356
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,899
artificial intelligence with machine

357
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,970
learning with next-generation

358
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,800
cloud-based blockchain all the buzz

359
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,410
words you want their upon use the same

360
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,089
technology we're using but they use

361
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,980
notifications to look at how they're

362
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,529
gonna compromise our systems and that's

363
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,940
going to happen so impose and how can

364
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,000
you as professionals looked at

365
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,130
your companies and defend your systems

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,510
well first thing is identify what you're

367
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,890
trying to protect if you don't know what

368
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,050
you're trying to protect then you can't

369
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,090
detect it so identifying what is put

370
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,719
some value on it and the higher the

371
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,160
value the resources you put them so deal

372
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,140
risk assessment what are the risks

373
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,110
against those assets how do we protect

374
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,870
those assets look at putting policies in

375
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,150
place I know look around may I say pause

376
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,650
you can see there are now not writing

377
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:57,630
policies but policies set an agenda they

378
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,819
tell the business what we need to do and

379
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,580
they tell people how we need to organize

380
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,320
so it's very important we were to say to

381
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,750
me Brian what money should I spend

382
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,450
investment in cyber security in the next

383
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,470
five months this is where I would say

384
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,970
put more money in security awareness

385
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,550
training making sure people are aware

386
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,090
and understand the risk while you have

387
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,589
controls in place how they should behave

388
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,750
but also say you need to Martin responds

389
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,710
look up what you're monitoring if you

390
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,540
read the Verizon ten bridge

391
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,460
investigation report they say on average

392
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,260
that takes six to eight weeks for

393
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,690
somebody for copy.c detective had a

394
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,430
breach which is about six to eight weeks

395
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,440
after the Crimmins have been and gone

396
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,599
and taking the date of the need so

397
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,150
monitor what you have and responds with

398
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,310
and yes we should be using active

399
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,699
artificial intelligence to to ensure

400
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:50,540
that we can provide and identify trends

401
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,490
and how we want to detect our systems

402
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,459
and then I also say we should be better

403
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:58,800
information sharing we don't share in

404
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,480
our industry we do not share information

405
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,099
it's still kind of seen as a a badge of

406
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,339
shame or whatever that we've we've had a

407
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,709
breach but harvest is a security breach

408
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,349
is part of business it is normal it will

409
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,730
happen that's how you deal with it and

410
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,319
how you respond to it is how you gonna

411
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,140
be measured and how you gonna be judged

412
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,909
not that you had a breach so I'd

413
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,610
encourage you to use existing frameworks

414
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,910
to look at patna post security in place

415
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,919
such as using ISO 27001 or the NIST

416
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,730
cybersecurity framework or even the

417
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,530
sentiment into a security they have the

418
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:38,440
security controls

419
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,629
or also look at from our own national

420
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,490
cybersecurity centered run by the

421
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,860
Department indications they actually

422
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,670
have a very good fight paper twelve-step

423
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,800
to service beauty and it's free

424
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,240
downloadable look at it follow the steps

425
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,790
in it it will help you put a good

426
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,130
program in place so that I like to say

427
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:00,090
thank you very much hope you really

428
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:03,340
enjoy the day it today is about you as

429
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,510
speakers are here to to help give the

430
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,149
guides and what you should need to do

431
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,460
but you guys are the ones are there

432
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:13,090
defendant companies and protecting data

433
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,250
you're the ones that we had an event

434
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,230
like this sharing and networking can

435
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,770
help and don't be afraid to share with

436
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,570
the search

437
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,310
if you've any instance because we can

438
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,080
reach out internationally the starts a

439
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,700
square to shut down malicious websites

440
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,389
attacking you or malicious acts

441
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,160
attacking you

442
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,530
that's how the starts a circle maybe

443
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,340
works so please do enjoy the day and

444
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,750
thank you very much

445
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,490
