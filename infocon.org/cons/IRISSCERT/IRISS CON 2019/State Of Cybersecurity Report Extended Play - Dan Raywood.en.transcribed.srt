1
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:07,480
one lacrosse the stage thanks very much

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,299
for coming and seeing me today there's

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,129
as Gordon said it's my third iris

4
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:13,660
carotid last year and back in 2012 and I

5
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,630
saw a mate for the first time he really

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,980
Mabel to see him again and yeah real

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,279
delight when Brian asked me if I wanted

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,310
to come along today to present on the

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,300
state aside security report version two

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,619
according to the extended play though

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,640
actually this is the unexpended play

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,890
originally we did a report which we

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,780
launched InfoSec Europe

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,010
back in June and then I did that

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,450
slightly longer version which became the

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,210
extended play but that was 45 minutes

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,850
now about to go back to 30 minutes yeah

18
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,829
you just keep up with me there's a lot

19
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,870
of Statistics coming up in the next 25

20
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,129
minutes or so so do boost it with me

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,780
also for anyone in the front row I

22
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,949
wasn't just ahead because I've been

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,870
sitting there this morning and something

24
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:56,440
maybe just I hate a bubble lectern so

25
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,589
it's great view isn't it so just a

26
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,129
little bit on me likes no video in mind

27
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,830
you'll be glad to know I've been info

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,750
security now for just almost four years

29
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,520
in about two or three weeks and I've

30
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,259
been covering side security since 2008

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,929
and a lot of people seem to manage my

32
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,040
time at SC magazine which is nice and I

33
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:20,110
was also called previously with the

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,880
4-5-1 so the same time security report

35
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,110
the idea of is we get lots and lots as

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,060
the threat of course has gone and said

37
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,640
anyone here whose works in the media or

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,740
works in any kind of environment we see

39
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,479
vendor threat reports you know how heavy

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,070
they are they come in oh yeah I'd like

41
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,539
seven in one day a couple of days ago

42
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,669
and there cuz they're people they employ

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,810
to promote them some wonder why you

44
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,020
don't write Martens like because I'm

45
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,430
like constantly so you know when I email

46
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,829
people I Brian so you gotta views on

47
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,670
these reports and he says is it trying

48
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:50,169
to sell a product and I'm like maybe is

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,040
it is it by that company that ends with

50
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,170
that you know Darkfire web I say

51
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,700
whatever when they made this rule never

52
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,539
trust any company with those words in

53
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,299
their name and so yeah we start looking

54
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,920
at these these thoughts all not freaky

55
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,440
do one ourselves that was actually going

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,229
to be maybe not as such a broad spectrum

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,190
of

58
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,720
responses but you know you can sauce

59
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,280
training and weaknesses ourselves we

60
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,440
talk to people that we know and that

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,690
sort of things so we did the first one

62
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,760
last year and this could be we couldn't

63
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,959
stay inside security report because it

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,940
was you know the first thing we thought

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,489
of as quite hostile up with a new name

66
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,609
first one 2018 we talked to 32 people

67
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:32,380
not a large sample I'll be the first to

68
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,050
admit and these are the numbers we got

69
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,200
back so 46 percent of the respondents

70
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,989
were about gdpr as being the top finding

71
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,089
tops trend in their perspective we did a

72
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,340
lot of the interviews I'd say around the

73
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,319
march/april time in the run-up to talk

74
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,660
to the InfoSec in June so hence you know

75
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,640
GPR was a lot of people's radar at the

76
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,019
time and then you can see the other ones

77
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,790
I won't know run through so some other

78
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,560
things coming up so we thought this it

79
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,900
seemed pretty popular actually so let's

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,930
do a second one which we started in in

81
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,560
2019 and we just got version to me and

82
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,459
I've seen two too complicated when

83
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,630
you're trying to write a report like

84
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,310
this you go to industry and so I'm

85
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,900
trying to do this the lot of people can

86
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,190
be quite hesitant there like one morning

87
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,599
this is going to be four am I gonna have

88
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,670
to go on the record or a sub to about

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,530
this trying to be quoted not know I like

90
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,298
this once you've done one on to me

91
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,040
really easy you just go you know that we

92
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,569
had last year yeah we did again

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,929
yeah and so it's about 60 people about

94
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:31,030
six weeks or so between 30 April and now

95
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,040
we determined 31 distinct trends if I

96
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,170
pick one of you out Tom Wayne could and

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,850
said maybe 31 things are happening in

98
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,638
cybersecurity right now you wouldn't go

99
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,260
you probably about six in it 31 trends

100
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:44,530
that's how broad we are as an industry

101
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,899
now the included five top trends so they

102
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,329
were the most prevalent and nosy trends

103
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,220
find lower trends lights at six to ten

104
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,959
if you think about the top ten and then

105
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,170
a single response trends the reason I

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,130
put that in this piece interesting the

107
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,048
something which is a trend but only one

108
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,340
person thought about so we're gonna run

109
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:05,440
through them just a couple of previews I

110
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,560
did get asked what's or people actually

111
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,299
do did get and serving I'm not keen on

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
putting up a huge list of names because

113
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,480
don't want that to be about you know who

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,510
was interviewed to be more about the

115
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,880
trends but yeah the job title so here's

116
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,488
kind of the log company people I was

117
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,440
also

118
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,179
on previous presentation who were

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,460
surveyed from what the from the balance

120
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,860
was that it is a little imbalance a lot

121
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,210
of private sets people which you know

122
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,740
there we go maybe we do this again we'll

123
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,568
do a bit more private and I've been more

124
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,330
public and a bit more third sector but

125
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:38,210
VC legal association there Emilie's

126
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,068
cetera so this is top five I'm gonna go

127
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,150
through this slightly faster because

128
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,819
there's a second piece of research I

129
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:47,030
wanna focus on a little bit more top 5

130
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,220
top finding only 35% brain when you and

131
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,739
that's the spread those 31 friends was

132
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,520
product problems and these kind of with

133
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,759
the the breakdown of reasons why so

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,719
you've got more technology than problems

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,660
one quote we've actually got in the

136
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,099
report is like there's about 26

137
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,840
solutions that air for 16 problems or

138
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,099
something like that yeah that's the

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,909
fluting are outweighing the actual

140
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:12,139
issues detection issues vulnerability

141
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,419
management just you know heard about

142
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,789
patching just now too much legacy

143
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,590
technology there's not much you can do

144
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,990
about that

145
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,310
number two is human factor great to

146
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,500
aware me this morning I know Jenny's

147
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,080
coming up after me as it were off the

148
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,970
break human factor takes into

149
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,229
consideration things like usability

150
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,400
empathy of the UPS fueling is quite an

151
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,008
interesting while you know how do we get

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,659
people we get people in but do we then

153
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,190
push them up through the ranks to

154
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,210
actually get them to the level but they

155
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,310
can then get into a senior position

156
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,020
social engineering weak first strongest

157
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,630
thing that could be another entire day

158
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,060
talking about that one as I said number

159
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,080
one last year was compliance and when I

160
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,520
was actually doing the initial research

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,050
it's with barely coming up a lot was

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,948
like thinking it back mad god no one no

163
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,719
one talked about compliance no one

164
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,940
talked about compliance look at the top

165
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,830
quite many trees like coming in so

166
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,880
compliance was the third most prevalent

167
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,460
trending twenty five percent of

168
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:13,219
responses and reasons for that is for

169
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:16,070
example as a GPR is around BSD to PCI

170
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:17,599
DSS also some of the stuff I did a lot

171
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,940
of the research as I said so February or

172
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,310
April and we wrote it in April ma April

173
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,770
May proofed it and then got it and push

174
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:29,449
that in early June these were before the

175
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,990
intentions of fines for BA and Marion so

176
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,520
hence why

177
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,580
that thing there about disappointment

178
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,380
over lack of finds however there's

179
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,520
definite compliance is also push vector

180
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,380
is the response practices and also like

181
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,450
an international impact which the CCPA

182
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,950
is the California privacy and you might

183
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,320
source in bear talk about that it's

184
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,070
pretty cool actually it's taking a lot

185
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,370
of the influence I would say from GDP

186
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:59,940
are right number four is company and

187
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,460
board engagement and it's an area where

188
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,440
the security team needs to be part of

189
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,549
the business really and also they need

190
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,710
support the business and what the

191
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,600
business does and so you don't like

192
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,400
businesspeople in a mature market now

193
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,130
cybersecurity mature market in their

194
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,469
view the discussion between the CEO and

195
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,000
the board has changed Brian said this

196
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,790
morning you know we've got the attention

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,040
now a government of law of boards of

198
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,690
regulators and actually you know how and

199
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,790
we actually what we do with that now

200
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:29,100
we've got their attention because as

201
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,320
Brian Graham was saying crowd of people

202
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,000
are followed it all hit the front pages

203
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,719
even with an arrest of someone hit the

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,220
front page also measuring culture that

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,830
some of you you know full of what we do

206
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,150
know that culture is a tricky one you

207
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,590
could sort of say where's the value in

208
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,419
that well I will say look at know before

209
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,070
buying Cairo as company you didn't

210
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,480
actually find the number I was about an

211
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,219
hour ago trying to still find out and

212
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
that make bought for them but you know

213
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,770
we were able to put a dollar amount

214
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,680
whether that dollar amount probably a

215
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,890
million-plus on actually having culture

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,510
as part of your as part of your business

217
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,880
strategy really and brought awareness

218
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,150
obviously we talked about right and the

219
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:10,290
fire fifth and final one is automation

220
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:12,810
the as doing this b5 Belfast about three

221
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,820
weeks ago and someone said automation

222
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,100
what do you mean by that isn't on AI and

223
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,240
machine learning this thing differently

224
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,630
competent in the same thing that I'm

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,640
like god that's the other so AI machine

226
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,430
money I did sorry if you don't like that

227
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,130
but I you know they first uncle said

228
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,480
they do sit in the same kind of silo and

229
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,689
the same kind of container as it were

230
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,400
but maybe we'll see having to go if we

231
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,960
do this again in 2020 you know how a I

232
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,309
and machine learning are though to so

233
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,409
distinctly different things

234
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,728
than when things are moving that people

235
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,218
will actually see as two different

236
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,939
things

237
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,110
I'll see a DevOps dfi our automation

238
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:51,240
even though actually you see from the

239
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,189
right hand side there's so much part on

240
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,629
AI and machine learning and immature

241
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:56,459
market even though it's negative thing

242
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:59,699
he still was being cited as a trend even

243
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,878
though it's not kind of a hugely popular

244
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:04,559
area that people want to talk about so

245
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:07,589
they were the top five so these came out

246
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:11,819
in June and so I've been talking around

247
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:13,499
this for a while and well you know I

248
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,689
will people sometimes say you know can

249
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:18,120
you compare 18 and 19 while the answer

250
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:19,920
is probably no because there were 32

251
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,180
people versus 60 people interview there

252
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,430
were different sets of people from the

253
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,748
people I talked to last year I didn't

254
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,109
talk to this year just for various

255
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:29,790
reasons availability etc so yeah I

256
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,170
decided sit-ins was to try and you know

257
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,459
do something original so if you want to

258
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,209
kind of go a like-for-like is probably

259
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,359
not there but you know ultimately

260
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:38,910
compliance is seen as less or less

261
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,269
severe kind of a trend the last year and

262
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:45,420
the five lower trends then so these were

263
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,709
as following yes hygiene cloud apt apt

264
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,199
was interesting one because I thought

265
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:52,109
this has been kind of dismissed by the

266
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:54,359
security community as being very you

267
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,860
know hype driven kind of thing but it

268
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,050
really came up actually I guess if you

269
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,250
consider the state of the world you know

270
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,740
the ransomware being developed by

271
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,610
nation-states the attacks the

272
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,730
interference kind of thing then yeah

273
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,069
maybe it's being seen seriously now

274
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,910
where I did one doormat ransomware into

275
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:13,229
that and agile transformation that

276
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,639
actually was when I started doing this

277
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,040
research idea of transformation was

278
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,870
actually a really really popular one but

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,779
it seemed Windell away into like 10th

280
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,309
place and the finger response trends her

281
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,110
I like putting these in because these

282
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:28,199
are just interesting to sort of see you

283
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,220
know what one person thought you might

284
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,449
look through those and go I can't

285
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,529
believe more people didn't say bug

286
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,109
bounties

287
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,839
the upset people among you might stare

288
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,740
can't believe no one else is puzzling

289
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,459
that's always fun in front of a Seto

290
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,259
audience and they go and my services

291
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:46,829
well another one that's kind of you know

292
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,370
it's pretty popular just one more thing

293
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,209
on this

294
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,279
I actually got this

295
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,508
normally go through who was talk to a

296
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,309
lot of people we do know but I did get

297
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:57,189
this from a chat group on Ben Tom hey've

298
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,860
then Hawkins of you know it's fulfilled

299
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:02,469
and saw a big Gardner he fed me this DM

300
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,149
and after you came out and saw said

301
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,429
rather surprised they weren't response

302
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,629
about containers so I thought well you

303
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:10,089
know let's have a little look into the

304
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:11,860
wrists of responses and see what people

305
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,209
actually said about containers and how

306
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,399
many talked about it yelled sir was to

307
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:17,949
him and someone else the other one was

308
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,869
these were some of the comments we got a

309
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:20,859
little more bang for your buck sorry no

310
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,709
more bang for your buck without the

311
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,420
security overheads

312
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:29,589
but option if contain technologies as

313
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,209
kubernetes rapidly matures like tweet

314
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,929
disposable virtual systems you had to

315
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:37,449
manage and batch best to hold containers

316
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:38,649
while they support all positive no one

317
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,740
else don't I said negative back

318
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:44,170
containers out to people obviously and

319
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,420
holding Italians Barrett and migrating

320
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,389
workloads between cloud providers and

321
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,529
also lets me do that as well so it's

322
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,269
yeah it could take us was an interesting

323
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,749
ones put in and like I said again I

324
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,309
think he's laugh at that okay you know

325
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:59,079
we got a few people since a me and did

326
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,839
anyone mentioned brexit result buzzing

327
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,939
we'll talk about yeah there you go okay

328
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,220
now for me you know and I just thought

329
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,420
let's put that one out because you know

330
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,699
he's Pacific Lee asked just as it came

331
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,959
out people often say a few questions

332
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,649
which I have address than some of the

333
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,138
added slides so that's kind the main

334
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:20,410
part of the research but what I wanted

335
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,670
to do was try and see how this yeah this

336
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,899
is all very nice to sort you know we

337
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,389
wrote about this and we push that the

338
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,860
report now and I've did some talks in

339
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,290
for a second a few other places but what

340
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,809
I want to try and do is see how these

341
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,449
trends actually being adopted by

342
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:37,299
businesses or not as the case of mobile

343
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:39,399
and actually helping the next generation

344
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,980
of people to come into the industry we

345
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:43,540
do a lot of sort of coverage info

346
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,339
security around how helping new people

347
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,779
come into the industry it's all very

348
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,839
well sitting going all there's a skills

349
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,160
crisis and you know no one's hiring well

350
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,290
maybe if you find the people who are out

351
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,179
there trying to find a job then and they

352
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,319
know what they were expecting we kind of

353
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,790
help bridge that gap so we're quite

354
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:59,449
interested in helping new people coming

355
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,040
to the industry and

356
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,360
yeah and try and do that kind of thing

357
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,189
so this is part of research I didn't I

358
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,460
thought let's try and find some people

359
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,560
we can talk to so I saw the second leg

360
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,120
of the research I went off to find

361
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,579
people who were in the first few years

362
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,790
of their careers still at university or

363
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,470
on work placements and so I guess 25 and

364
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,579
under I suppose there's something a bit

365
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,670
older if that's just you start your

366
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,230
period bit like it's about 50 plus so

367
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,089
almost actually in the end almost as

368
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,630
many as I did with the original research

369
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,940
and often seven questions based on the

370
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,560
findings and asked them how these are

371
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,470
affecting their skills their training

372
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,760
and opportunities in work and just big

373
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,990
shout out to Creston side secure

374
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,000
challenge because they actually helped

375
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,020
me do some they didn't mail outs for me

376
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,760
and got some people responding to it so

377
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,590
seven questions and the first one then

378
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,750
was quite simply are you ready to deal

379
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:52,430
with malware this is because of the

380
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,520
technology problems especially around

381
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,500
detection and those kind of issues so I

382
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,610
thought if the next generation of people

383
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,320
are seeing these stories about

384
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,440
ransomware like right Rogers talking

385
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,640
about and they confident in actually

386
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,470
that they go into a business though

387
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,430
right let's start reverse engineering

388
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,060
for example

389
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:13,069
so they've the answers of the 53 who

390
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,530
answered it obviously slightly more

391
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,080
majority were positive and I just

392
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,060
through some of the comments so it's

393
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,380
becoming more days today a lot of the

394
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,819
responses were very much like I've

395
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,850
absorbed taking an interest in this

396
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:28,820
person me and you know from the

397
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,470
negatives without experience if you are

398
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,120
training people this is could be a real

399
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,500
way to soar help people learn a little

400
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,170
bit more always do solve it reverse

401
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,340
engineering and seeing McAfee guys at

402
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,010
the front here you know where your

403
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,560
situation but if you know you were able

404
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,490
to do this straight out that at the

405
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,750
university or college or even just doing

406
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,810
your own some people might just be

407
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,920
interested in this stuff

408
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,839
covering all the bases probably an

409
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,849
impossible task there was a bit of a

410
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,150
trend of it being very much team effort

411
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,370
and if you're able to actually run

412
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:02,840
things on your own time as well then

413
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,420
that's gonna be harder and catching so

414
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,130
far as give me the knowledge to deal

415
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,120
with these types of threats efficiently

416
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,410
these these level

417
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,400
inque's I didn't make these up these are

418
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,920
actually quotes with the people we

419
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,360
actually talk to and I'll give you a bit

420
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,599
more information at the end just where

421
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,830
your hints or read a bit more thoroughly

422
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,930
so that was positive inflection to the

423
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,760
first trend of technology problems and

424
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:28,849
detection etc the second one oh there we

425
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,850
go okay I think I might write the second

426
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,620
one then it's that I see cry out wasn't

427
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,080
a top-five trend this year but was last

428
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,510
year but with so much around that is

429
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,250
your AWS and infrastructure-as-a-service

430
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:45,319
in 2019 the actually this is now a real

431
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,120
quite significant trend I think for the

432
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,650
whole industry so I thought you know

433
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,570
let's ask the question have you learned

434
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,800
enough 20 work with these as a service

435
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:55,520
options rather than your pretty standard

436
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,740
network security yeah pretty pretty sort

437
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,300
of harsh no actually this might just

438
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,339
because it is literally perfect it just

439
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,750
feels to me like an emerging trend on if

440
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:06,380
you're in university of course that was

441
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,360
maybe designed in 2017 for example how

442
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,100
up to date is that going to be as you

443
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,560
come to graduate maybe next year on the

444
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,380
year after to actually give you that

445
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,770
train to work with with them IAS as it

446
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,480
were

447
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,680
so yeah the training is available sort

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,209
of thing they've got around training is

449
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,620
it's out there if you want to start

450
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,689
looking around the internet look at

451
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,279
maybe even watch YouTube there might be

452
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,760
some YouTube videos on this kind of

453
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,870
stuff

454
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,420
things are out there and available you

455
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:39,380
need to have the work list users part

456
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:42,170
with job role it was tough and no doubt

457
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,730
that personal research again much luck

458
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,650
with the now loved one if you peds but

459
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,940
the sort of the legwork in as a new

460
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,520
person or you know you're looking for

461
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,779
people to hire and you know they've seen

462
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,430
they've done that personal research

463
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:53,720
element hopefully that's enough of the

464
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,219
boosts to make you feel actually this

465
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,089
person's blonde kind of the extra mile

466
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:02,150
and oh that's a third one is very third

467
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,819
question was to get compliance and as I

468
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,189
said top top

469
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,369
finding last year top 1/3 out fired this

470
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:12,170
year as a result then we see a lot of

471
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:14,750
talk now GRC governance risk in

472
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,670
compliance are we seeing more demand for

473
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,050
this in job as a people do people need

474
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,180
to know about compliance

475
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:26,089
to actually be able to get a job now so

476
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:30,170
for this one clearly 5050 almost

477
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,210
slightly or veering on the 27 slightly

478
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,190
higher so yes that's positive obviously

479
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,100
and a positive means that yes I have yes

480
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,900
I've seen is it cetera so just a few

481
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,100
points sketching which is coming out

482
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,080
more often some of the comments wish you

483
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,669
saw the more negative ones where people

484
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,740
just don't seem to be looking for them

485
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,900
so maybe about half a dozen what kind of

486
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,180
we'll see I'm not really looking for a

487
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,530
compliance job well okay The Apprentice

488
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,140
- probably still needs to know about

489
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,450
compliance framework so you know

490
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,200
consider that if you are actually sort

491
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,040
thinking I only want to work with

492
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,780
malware for example it's probably

493
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,139
working about PCI and I've actually even

494
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,290
packed of ransomware upon that the

495
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,370
current job seeker definitely increase

496
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,680
seventeen eighty ten that my job at

497
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,260
alerts are in this area so compliance is

498
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,330
the big one and that's why we asked this

499
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,850
one more clients is always mentioned for

500
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,000
audit or written six roles let's go to

501
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:29,060
the next one then so people were seeing

502
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,430
these but as I mentioned you know gdpr

503
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,600
is pretty prevalent we all quit you

504
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,080
familiar with that but do we know the

505
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,679
ins and outs of it this OPC IDC isso PSD

506
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,290
to did so et cetera so are you worried

507
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,250
the demands of what actually is required

508
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,830
of them and from that I say 54 answer's

509
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,660
yes we see like pretty clued up kind of

510
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,879
next generation of people who seem to

511
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,730
know what's going on but their guidance

512
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,470
material media has been pretty good at

513
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,820
picking up compliance because people

514
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,030
want to talk about compliance they want

515
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,740
to read about it but there's a lack of

516
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,870
education around this again this much

517
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,580
good timing issue it might be down to

518
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,860
the fact that universities aren't we

519
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,750
keeping up with the change in things

520
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,280
like data protection laws because you

521
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,890
know these all pretty new those of you

522
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,830
remember the intake GTR was now 18

523
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,810
months in I'm not saying we haven't we

524
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,320
are care anymore but we do carry still a

525
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,909
lot more but our training capabilities

526
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,010
there are they keeping up you know I'm

527
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,240
seeing more and more conferences now

528
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,520
roll up you know purely about data

529
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,679
protection and

530
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:37,120
I don't eat demographic ligo's these

531
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,980
things are and I've not had PSD to if

532
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,139
you haven't heard of guess teaching

533
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,910
there is some magazines dishing had

534
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,860
hanging around so a couple on that row

535
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,770
over there good that's like blue cover

536
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,659
it's my own PSD to no plug so yeah I

537
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,730
can't worried about that I pay them

538
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:59,590
services ping services standard thank

539
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,730
you thanks bro PSD - yeah this was a

540
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,510
very difficult one that's going to hold

541
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,040
up to some some issues around different

542
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,050
things but yeah worth looking into that

543
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,920
one

544
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:13,149
all right next one now obviously two

545
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,429
things there have been compliance and

546
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,260
clouds so if you don't have these things

547
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,550
and you haven't been prepared know you

548
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,809
haven't put the extra work in are you

549
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,950
gonna go into a job on day one and

550
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,178
they're gonna sort of say right work

551
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,670
what have you got and you're like I

552
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,530
didn't have time to do it well actually

553
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,940
is it up to the job to actually train

554
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,700
you and the aren't we obviously gonna be

555
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:34,809
yeah pretty heavily yes still 13 out of

556
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,920
the 5000 I'll actually did say no but

557
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:38,649
they'd only do it if there's a business

558
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,740
requirement to actually just train this

559
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,179
I think kind of a few of the mist kind

560
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,770
of sums that up a lot of the responses

561
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:48,850
really practices companies won't paper

562
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,500
training if they don't have to and any

563
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:55,290
jobs provide training to help employees

564
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:59,170
grow in areas that will benefit them and

565
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,090
one bit about but there that still

566
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,630
obviously affects a lot of the career

567
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,850
tracks in cybersecurity is the job ads

568
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,650
that are posted

569
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,330
we've all had conversations about HR and

570
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,700
how they demand certain levels of

571
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,169
expectation because you know they have

572
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,309
to tick the boxes of what people need to

573
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,280
have to get the job

574
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:20,110
so are they requiring unachievable

575
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,020
levels of experience and qualifications

576
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,399
obviously you know fits in with the the

577
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,320
research receiver actually with the IC

578
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,110
squares came out police say there's our

579
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,710
four million who's now the skills gap

580
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:36,610
globally so from that yeah 5130 one out

581
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:39,880
of the 54 isn't it said with a positive

582
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,100
response they often require degrees you

583
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,720
know degrees

584
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,360
yes universities are doing a great job

585
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,830
but if that's the only you only pull

586
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,899
this to look for people actually I've

587
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,320
got that level of education there the

588
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:53,758
limit which is a it is a shame preachers

589
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,500
don't really know what they want or need

590
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,970
and especially yeah this is current

591
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,529
summarize it really wanted to be cyber

592
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,779
ninjas that have uni and paid military

593
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,190
level wages I don't actually I mean I

594
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:06,870
did all these interviews to this

595
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,149
particular section all anonymously I

596
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,120
said the one salgo shaming anybody who

597
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,649
was who was responding I don't remember

598
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,178
a few up top my head by gently want to

599
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,320
make these anonymous so people could say

600
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,059
things like that and not to worry about

601
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,789
you know ruining their entire career

602
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:25,080
before beating started it so yeah that's

603
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:26,759
a great comment this is the last

604
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,240
question then so the board engagement

605
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,559
was in our top five and also board

606
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,590
awareness has been in the top five last

607
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,090
year so of communication and

608
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,049
presentation skills been taught or

609
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:43,459
encouraged to a level that you're

610
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:46,679
comfortable with I think yeah 20 X 25 so

611
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,000
48:53 yeah if you get very much split

612
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,679
down the middle they're actually about

613
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,940
people out there I think that that's a

614
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,740
personal thing I think people some

615
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,580
people are very naturally quite capable

616
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,860
of speaking on stage you know hopefully

617
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,658
things like hacking societies and local

618
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,979
b-sides event and I respond now you know

619
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,409
and other things are given the

620
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,309
opportunities for new people to come in

621
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:06,539
but if you're not getting the

622
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,210
opportunity to do it you can interrupt

623
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:11,940
your CEO and explain why you're not

624
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,590
vulnerable to heartbleed as an example

625
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,460
or do blue cube is probably better

626
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,639
example

627
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,149
so just a few comments hasn't been

628
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:23,459
taught a lot of emphasis on these

629
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,000
abilities and be able to comfortable as

630
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,950
present and communicate and also

631
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,909
hopefully that's the kind of thing

632
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,860
conducting a professional manner may

633
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,980
communicate to ease bias or the any

634
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,959
organization so these were the yeah

635
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,450
that's the last of the seven then so and

636
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,950
what I'm actually doing is I'm write an

637
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,690
article on each one of these questions

638
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,340
every week the third one is going up

639
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,610
somewhere Tom never exactly which one it

640
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,309
is

641
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,899
where I use a lot more of these comments

642
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,340
that we're free to read maybe these

643
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:52,518
questions are three degrees so that they

644
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,869
got up tomorrow and you know hopefully

645
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,849
gives you a bit more insight of what

646
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:58,129
sort of the answers I Robin just these

647
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:01,369
each your comments so just kind of few

648
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:03,289
takeaways of the overall research then

649
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:05,899
yeah so detection is remains a large

650
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:07,849
issue and but people feel comfortable

651
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:09,379
dealing with malware it's not something

652
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:12,189
that's a major problem

653
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:14,899
or it seems for the next generation

654
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,940
compliance people are aware of it even

655
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:18,859
