1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,820
Thanks

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,150
so the title for my position today

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:14,619
contains the word future so the

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,869
procession consists of a fair amount of

5
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:19,240
hand waving obviously I'll try to

6
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:22,000
substantiate those past examples where

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,619
possible a few more word about myself as

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,259
it was already told I'm a researcher and

9
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:28,509
CEO of possible security and some of the

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,970
presentations I'd like to mention that

11
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:33,129
I've done in in the past is hacking the

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,899
combos which is the jack-in-the-box and

13
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,660
the twelve personal privacy which is

14
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:42,280
more high-level so social presentation

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,679
at 35 c3 now let's get to it let's talk

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,960
about threat profiles I myself

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,500
personally have had a huge problem with

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
threat profiles not more than ten years

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,289
ago

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,269
I was trying to protect myself against

21
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,010
every possible every Mashable threat and

22
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:59,620
what I did here stand back then is that

23
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,570
you can't fully protect against

24
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,000
everything because you need infinite

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,799
resources and unfortunately we have a

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,950
different than infinite amount of

27
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,860
resources available to our protection so

28
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:14,049
we actually have to prioritize and as

29
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,630
many of you know the threat profiling

30
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:19,119
depends on who you are what you are what

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,610
you do so for example a ministry being

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,560
attacked by a fancy bleep bird is one

33
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,360
thing as cruel being attacked by pupils

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,670
doing funky stuff to your hardware is

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,470
different thing so you have to

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,490
prioritize you have the profile your

37
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:36,670
threats now one more threat of flood

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:40,919
software where does your software come

39
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:46,299
from now in meknes predation tried to

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,409
create a graph of percentages of sources

41
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,909
of software that we use but

42
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,610
unfortunately I couldn't find any

43
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:55,570
reasonable data that that that quantity

44
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,070
that does that quantitatively so what I

45
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,408
kind of said is how many different

46
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,750
countries do you think your software

47
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:04,780
comes to come from and again for each of

48
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,369
us it's gonna be a different number for

49
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,919
those of you who is using core using

50
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:11,500
open software open source Linux for

51
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,649
example Linux alone

52
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,050
the operating system comes probably from

53
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,850
50 maybe 60 maybe 70 countries because

54
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,220
of all different developers from

55
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,870
different countries collaborating and

56
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,600
there are different legislations for

57
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:30,700
each country and that will be an

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,410
important part later now 0 days are of

59
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,970
course total abilities that are yet

60
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,500
unknown to the vendor just to make sure

61
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,980
that you are aware this is still

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,990
relevant

63
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,670
here are some zero days I'm not going to

64
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,489
talk about them but as you see by the ID

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,079
numbers they they keep happening every

66
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,239
year those of you who are who are maybe

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,310
not following the zero day market 0 days

68
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,170
happen they will keep happening and and

69
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,800
there's a bunch more companies I just

70
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,600
took a couple what good ones here now a

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,030
fixed against vulnerabilities of course

72
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,640
the security patch but security patch

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,980
will fix a vulnerability only when both

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,529
of these things happen why not rather

75
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,359
first the vendor has to notice the

76
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,300
vulnerability to create a security patch

77
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,180
and second more importantly the user has

78
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:20,440
to install the patch so only then will

79
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,420
security patch be effective now what I'd

80
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,239
like to show you is a comparison between

81
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,829
what went or does with a bug was it was

82
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,140
security mobility and what an attacker

83
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,850
does attackers in the red of course when

84
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,040
there is in the blue so here's an

85
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,269
example of a zero-day being discovered

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,320
and exploited attacker discovers a bug

87
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,470
sometime is needed to right they explode

88
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,930
sometimes for easy bugs it has taken me

89
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,790
30 minutes for hard bugs it can take a

90
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,829
couple days maybe even more maybe a week

91
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,100
or two and then attack you can start

92
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:53,079
uploading the bug actively and the

93
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,760
quieter attacker is the harder it is for

94
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,260
someone to notice that the bugs being

95
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,298
exploited so unless you start blasting

96
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,670
everyone with your zero day you can it

97
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,709
can go on for a long time now the vendor

98
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,768
other hand will at some point discover

99
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,030
the bug will publish a patch and then we

100
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,280
have this long window if user actually

101
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,950
applying the patch now one thing that

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,890
makes happen is of course that the

103
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,659
exploit may be burned by attacker not

104
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,130
using it in a careful manner and then

105
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,400
vendor gets not fit immediately that

106
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,889
fact exploitation is going on and this

107
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:28,020
process is a bit more positive for the

108
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:30,180
vendor and the users now what security

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,609
patches do is of course save users from

110
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,830
existing vulnerabilities they mean squat

111
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,240
for zero day mitigation they don't do

112
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,969
anything against those because that's

113
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,900
what zero that means I just explained

114
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:46,410
also interesting security patches allow

115
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,210
attackers to develop one days now one

116
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,130
day is a different kind of story here

117
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,859
here we have a different slide so a

118
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,870
vendor has discovered a bug and the

119
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,430
vendor has published the patch and what

120
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,650
the factor does immediately the

121
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,210
reverse-engineer the patch to create so

122
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,440
called one day and if they publish it in

123
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,150
India place since the patches I would

124
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,370
that's a one day many users still

125
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,469
haven't patched the system and they can

126
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,889
still exploit those users so that's a

127
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,440
different thing that we have to consider

128
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,789
and finally security patches do one more

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,800
thing they may introduce new

130
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:20,190
vulnerabilities like in this picture

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,419
here so the the old AC wasn't powerful

132
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,630
enough so they removed it from the

133
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:29,760
window and placed a more powerful AC

134
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:32,849
nearby and now we have secured before in

135
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,909
real life in IT so for example here here

136
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:38,699
we have skullcap Shortridge talking

137
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:40,530
about fixing or or as a discovering bug

138
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,419
and X in what that was fixed and then a

139
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,510
new bug appears only in the fixed

140
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,219
version stuff like that happens I've

141
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,419
been doing some research on micro tech

142
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,650
which is not the topic of

143
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,150
instrumentation but here just slides

144
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,479
from one of our presentations on micro

145
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,340
TRS it describes different different

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,070
bugs and when they have been patched and

147
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,669
there's this one really nice bug at the

148
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,770
very right side and the bug is in how

149
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,359
they store the user passwords if someone

150
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,520
gets access to the file system what they

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,750
can do is they can easily reverse the

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,310
password because they say it's our

153
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,680
reversible it's uncrackable and they do

154
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,449
use a hash function they either use md5

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,389
to be fair not a good hash function but

156
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,419
still the algorithm is they take the

157
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,220
username they add that string over there

158
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:25,830
take an md5 of that and then sort the

159
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,780
result with the password that's how they

160
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,650
protect the password and they didn't

161
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,619
touch that but they did implement a new

162
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,419
system

163
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,620
they did implement a more secure storage

164
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,380
of passwords but for backwards

165
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:42,100
compatibility they still steward both of

166
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,110
those encryption in the files so you've

167
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,430
had this old bug encryption you had the

168
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,770
super cool elliptic curve cryptography

169
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,430
encryption finally they moved away from

170
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,599
that finally they told users if you can

171
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,210
update to this version we're gonna

172
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,890
delete your old password and it's gonna

173
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,159
be fine you know it's not gonna be there

174
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,919
but if you ever downgrade to a version

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,800
before that bug was pointed out by

176
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,130
myself you will lose your passwords and

177
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,020
everyone will be able to log in so I

178
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,300
mean it's a no-win situation they had to

179
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,760
do something so they did it but when you

180
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,220
do the downright password is removed so

181
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,920
what researchers did is they noticed

182
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,840
that HTTP is being used for getting the

183
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,340
latest version so you can you know

184
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,460
intercept that request and say that

185
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,020
latest version is like not six four five

186
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,900
six like in this example for example six

187
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,640
for one which you know doesn't have the

188
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,530
secure password and that was removed so

189
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,349
that's not a way how we can introduce

190
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,020
rumor abilities when patching now but

191
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,730
main problem is of course that users are

192
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,520
slow so that's why we have automatic

193
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,550
patching Android iOS mobile devices were

194
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,830
I'd say well first if we talk about mass

195
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,870
mass market products but we also see

196
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,820
Windows we see with the other operating

197
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,620
systems and we see of course we've seen

198
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,510
for a long time commercial specific

199
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,670
networking products using automatically

200
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,469
patching and that of course means that

201
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,020
the user doesn't have to interact to

202
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,600
install the patch which is good which

203
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,150
means that we move this application of

204
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,160
patch really closely to publishing the

205
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,900
patch but it's still it may be not the

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,990
same thing for example if you look at

207
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,090
our US infrastructure the user will get

208
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,710
a push for an iOS update a day later

209
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,719
maybe two or three days later because of

210
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,250
the sheer amount of devices so they're

211
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,420
still a window for attacker to exploit

212
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,130
but it is of course better right well

213
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,320
let me talk about a different kind of

214
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,580
threat

215
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,100
I'd like to point out right here that

216
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,430
for the representation NSA is a figure

217
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,310
of speech other countries also have

218
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,909
agencies there are well-funded criminal

219
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,550
groups

220
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,949
and so on so actually probably most of

221
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,630
this doesn't doesn't apply to a neighbor

222
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,550
kook who knows right but there are

223
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:55,960
agencies and criminals so there was this

224
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,910
unit at NSA called tailored access

225
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,070
operations rumors are that then change

226
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,680
the name after after Snowden leaks and

227
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,240
what they could do is they can tack you

228
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,819
any way they want basically so they have

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,150
the best people and and and they do the

230
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,400
lowest level the most hardcore kags

231
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,670
sometimes they also make were abilities

232
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,170
if needed well not not the PATA oh it

233
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,959
specifically but NSA like for example

234
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,880
this random generator do a look the

235
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,560
curve which was discovered to be at

236
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,800
least insecure maybe back in order to of

237
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,170
course diffic Hellman and many more so

238
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,370
you know stuff like that happens and we

239
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,479
have to deal with that but I'd like to

240
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,010
make a small small detour here remember

241
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
how in Snowden leaks those of you who

242
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,470
who who saw some pictures on the

243
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,680
Internet they use this nice graphic SSL

244
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,090
as being removed and added here well in

245
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,979
November the actual an essay published

246
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,770
this document is publicly available it's

247
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,350
it's universally accessible and they

248
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,150
have a new logo for for SSL removal I

249
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,720
really really appreciate the triangle

250
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:01,480
and and the eye over there

251
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,740
so but and I say this trusts that you

252
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,380
remember in the safe that's an aside the

253
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,140
figure of speech so they would verify

254
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,970
the badge first I imagine and patch

255
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,319
lights were they wouldn't just blindly

256
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,640
badge because you know no one knows

257
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,350
what's in the patch we've seen examples

258
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,850
I've showed the examples of patches

259
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,600
actually containing more vulnerabilities

260
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,560
than they're trying to fix okay but

261
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,580
let's put the tailored expirations aside

262
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,459
in the end states there are also

263
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,080
national security security letters and

264
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,430
again this can also be considered a

265
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,360
figure of speech because you know there

266
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,650
are different countries different

267
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,780
procedures and as far as we know in the

268
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,750
United States national letters are used

269
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,380
basically to simply request information

270
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:46,660
but what if under the table it's being

271
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:50,140
used to request more and I'm positive

272
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,610
that other mechanisms for requesting a

273
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,770
company to do something and be silent

274
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,020
about it exist

275
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,110
around the world also you can't

276
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,630
disregard the chance of large companies

277
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,550
large suppliers being infiltrated by

278
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,890
both government agents and criminal

279
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:09,069
group agents that is a real possibility

280
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,140
and it had happened before but NSA also

281
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,800
loves batches because batches have

282
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,449
amazing damage potential now let me give

283
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,109
you some examples so you don't think

284
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,490
that is pure fiction this just happened

285
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,290
security researchers at spider lab

286
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,300
discovered the malware campaign sending

287
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,040
through distributed three emails saying

288
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,310
that please update your windows this is

289
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,170
a new Petra version and it's malware hmm

290
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,339
well the delivery channel is email so

291
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,410
there's nothing important nothing

292
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,090
nothing serious let's take a look at

293
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,219
something we're delivery channel was an

294
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,380
update but let's start with a less

295
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,920
serious note so VLC for I guess anyone

296
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,870
uses that it's yeah it's it's an app

297
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,250
that allows you to play videos also what

298
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,020
they did because of some legal dispute

299
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,690
they pushed an updated version that's

300
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,340
removed a codec and only acknowledged

301
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,130
that in the next update following that

302
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,720
in the changelog so I would consider

303
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,910
that malicious purpose as the user I

304
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,260
mean there are legal legal things in

305
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,469
there which I'm not in touch but as a

306
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,970
user that's Melissa's update to me then

307
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,770
we of course have for example this this

308
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,080
case where attackers he abused

309
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,870
credentials of a software company to

310
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,160
publish a bad version that contains

311
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,140
smaller and this happens a lot it has

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,689
happened with many many different

313
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,790
different tools may be pure FTP D is is

314
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,060
one of the more well-known examples but

315
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,849
it happens all the time and of course

316
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,800
who doesn't remember the FTDI they did

317
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,200
twice actually well no one thought that

318
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,329
did it again but they did it twice so

319
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,860
they used Windows Update one of those

320
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,330
cases they used Windows Update actually

321
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,910
at not only push a driver update that

322
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,770
would brick device is welcome profit

323
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,930
versus once again the legal part on that

324
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,290
might be may be great but it's much

325
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:55,599
subject so the potential is clearly

326
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,790
there ok but it's not all that bad we

327
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,690
have to remember that if someone decides

328
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,790
to use mechanisms like that and mass the

329
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,300
it immediately would burn that specific

330
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,030
access lecture also it would under

331
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,740
mine all the work that we as security

332
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,230
experts been doing all these past years

333
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,470
telling users first to update and then

334
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,210
to install automatic updates is you know

335
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,850
then they would be getting malicious

336
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,120
updates but you have to keep in mind

337
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:28,200
that targeted attacks are still a

338
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:34,260
concern depending on what is that you do

339
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:37,140
what is your thread profile now to make

340
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,660
sure that you understand how prevalent 0

341
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,520
this actually are and how easily

342
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,350
accessible they are let's talk about 0

343
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,140
the market a bit so there are multiple

344
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,640
multiple companies whooping from a zero

345
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,560
team so that's that's out of the market

346
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,480
whooping is out but we have the other

347
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,680
companies and the Indian is a different

348
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,210
community not the one that we have

349
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,729
because concert boosts over there that's

350
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:01,320
that's a different one I think so you

351
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,330
have these companies and hacking teams

352
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,320
still alive which is surprising but they

353
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:09,840
are that buys or research is depending

354
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,470
on the company profile zero days and

355
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,720
then rent or sells them now from leaked

356
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,030
documents about a bit more than five

357
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,690
years ago we see that the actual prices

358
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,699
for a partner as they're called to

359
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,000
access the zero days it's not that time

360
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,800
I mean you'd think the prices are high

361
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,420
because if you look for example at this

362
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,930
chart of what zero to zero team face

363
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:39,360
researchers and here for Windows Windows

364
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,150
Arcia windows remote code execution

365
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,150
without any clicks maximum payment is 1

366
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,290
million u.s. dollars and I'm not even

367
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,689
talking about mobile which goes up to

368
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,230
2.5 million dollars depending depending

369
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,200
on the vector and the chain but the the

370
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,240
at least more than five years ago what

371
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,870
you had to pay ticket taxes that was

372
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:04,350
quite quite low it was in most cases the

373
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:08,280
documents that leaked had under had

374
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,920
prices under $100,000 a year

375
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,810
tip 4 - to access this infrastructure in

376
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,459
taxes these resources and I mean it

377
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,930
makes sense they bite once and they

378
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,580
resell it to you know 100 government

379
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,339
some of them which are oppressive some

380
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,930
of them maybe are torturing people who

381
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:27,460
knows so it is it is a strange conundrum

382
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,890
we're in right actually when you talk

383
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,350
about the other market on one hand we

384
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,899
need those zero dates for some cases

385
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,870
like child occupation exploitation

386
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,660
sometimes cannot be effectively sold

387
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,630
without using some zero this and and and

388
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,160
direct attacks and they have been some

389
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,890
successful attacks against or for

390
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,399
example some of them some of them were

391
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,140
to combat drug mmm

392
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,750
drug market some of them were against

393
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,360
shadow specifically so it is needed but

394
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,010
at the same time there is no control so

395
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,570
that's why we had what's in our

396
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:07,020
agreement and so on but it's a different

397
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:09,610
story so ok let me give you a solution

398
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,220
and that was the serious part of the

399
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,720
talk because I mean I don't have I'm not

400
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,029
here to sell a product and even if I

401
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,830
would I don't have a product I can't I

402
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,870
can't fixed anything I just found the

403
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:24,790
thing and and it's a problem so I got

404
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:27,970
some ideas on what we can do to to work

405
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,370
in the right direction and to to move

406
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,410
away from patching and and find

407
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,440
something else let me remind you the

408
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,640
first slide again just so it's clear

409
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,760
when someone can watch this on youtube

410
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,089
and and and then go to their you know

411
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,770
CEO will go there the CI CI so and tell

412
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,450
we don't need patches let's save the

413
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,400
money no that's not the point

414
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,250
most of us need patches depending on

415
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,079
thread profile it may be more prudent to

416
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:57,610
a lot of stall patches and do something

417
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,990
else in some rare cases so what I

418
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,459
present to you and I just I added this

419
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,100
lapis I need the name and then refer to

420
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,599
this solution in the next in in the

421
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,829
coming slides so I just need the name

422
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,379
and what I got is zero decks with

423
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,879
dynamic evaluation and detection that's

424
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,339
the name I have that's the acronym I

425
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,490
have for for my product modes and

426
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,559
products for my idea here okay so the

427
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,010
solution from I never thought that I'd

428
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:24,149
say that I never thought that I tell an

429
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,740
audience K let's use the cloud but the

430
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,140
cloud in in broader sense can actually

431
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,059
provide something here so we can and we

432
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,679
already doing that as an industry we are

433
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,389
at matically sharing attack signatures

434
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,240
using different vendor tools that's

435
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,700
already happening and that's good and

436
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,620
cloud enables that what we are also

437
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,320
doing in small part but we should grow

438
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,719
that part is using machine learning to

439
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,850
detect less careful attacks we are using

440
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,190
heuristics right now a lot

441
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,639
that's not exactly machine learning per

442
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:58,900
se so machine learning can be in my

443
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:02,470
opinion used to make sure that most of

444
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:07,240
the attacks get prevented now speaking

445
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,679
of less careful attacks we I I mentioned

446
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,809
let's go for tax here because if the

447
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,549
attack is perfect there is nothing you

448
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:15,520
can do

449
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,780
forget it I mean start hacking right if

450
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,480
there are some mistakes there is

451
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,799
something you can do and do these

452
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,000
straight actors that I'm talking about

453
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,379
here agencies of different countries

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,049
criminal groups was with lots of

455
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,440
manpower and intelligence do they

456
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,799
actually make mistakes like that well

457
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,740
yes they do

458
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,840
for example the Trident exploit it was

459
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,350
an exploit chain of three exploits and

460
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,659
was well it for all these versions of

461
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,809
Apple iOS from version 7.0 to version

462
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,299
9.3 point 4 that's multiple years of

463
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,370
devices being updated every day every

464
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:53,740
time an update comes out and still being

465
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,540
vulnerable to the attack now some of you

466
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,970
know the story right how they how the

467
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,860
chain was burned so there was a

468
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,070
journalist who received the text message

469
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,459
and SMS saying hey click the smaller

470
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:10,320
link well basically and the thing is the

471
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:13,120
journalist was a victim of being

472
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,030
attacked specifically directed at him

473
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,120
two previous times already so he had

474
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,410
contact with with a security company and

475
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,178
if he of course includes link and

476
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,640
forwarded to the company and that's how

477
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:28,900
they exploit all the three exploits got

478
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,000
burned and it was around for four or

479
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,860
five years ago I think and at that point

480
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,600
what I saw something amazing Apple

481
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,370
that's usually super slow to patch I

482
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,590
mean let's forget what they did in

483
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,260
September October now is is but Apple

484
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,090
that's usually slow to patch back there

485
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,410
fixed it in ten days they patched all

486
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,030
three exploits and they push the update

487
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,410
in ten days which was an amazing

488
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,070
response time so it was really critical

489
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,300
to them apparently but the point is

490
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,360
attackers tend to be negligent

491
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,950
especially in zero day market where the

492
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,389
people developing the exploit or the

493
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,660
people selling these exploits are not

494
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,080
the people be using or abusing the

495
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,950
exploits so what we're looking for is

496
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,600
something like an anti-virus but so it

497
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,220
would be an anti-virus for network

498
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,199
monitor device it would be an anti-virus

499
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,670
running on a honeypot it would be an ant

500
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,320
were strong enough for that but it's not

501
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,350
an anti-virus it's it's like an

502
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,169
anti-virus right so it would it would

503
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,360
use machine learning I feel I feel like

504
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,630
I'm selling snake all right here all

505
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,419
right now these machine learning to try

506
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,190
and understand if there is any

507
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,800
executable data in where that should be

508
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,540
non-executable data only and some other

509
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,580
algorithms right but let's talk about

510
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,010
ant verses first right would you agree

511
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,840
that anti viruses are on the decline

512
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,450
that we see less and less than two hours

513
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,639
to being abused being recommended by

514
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,520
cyber security experts some of you have

515
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,960
maybe seen that so what has happen to to

516
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,610
the antivirus market then it's important

517
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,340
to understand that if we are gonna

518
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:01,090
propose using something like the

519
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,000
antivirus again so for the most part

520
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,370
anti viruses do no good if the user is

521
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,950
careful right firewall with super useful

522
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,199
remember Windows XP before so respect to

523
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,550
you were installing it connect to the

524
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,530
Internet by the time you finish the

525
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,899
resolution you have already got some

526
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,690
hour in your Windows XP firewalls are

527
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,880
are nice and dandy for for anti viruses

528
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,650
they mostly protect the second line of

529
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,390
defense so to say well George after the

530
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,060
firewall after the user then we have the

531
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,470
antivirus now and they mostly don't

532
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,290
protect against zero-days

533
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:34,810
I've seen Kaspersky which is a Russian

534
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,970
and verse company advertising that their

535
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,950
antivirus has a numbers occasional stop

536
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,840
this zero days at zero they so found a

537
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,440
bug that's no one that no one had fun

538
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,230
before probably true but it's it's not

539
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,429
the rule it's an exception it's lock so

540
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,200
mostly they don't protect against zero

541
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,830
days and they also provide extra attack

542
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,960
service

543
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,510
there has been research into active are

544
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,810
so the

545
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,520
one I was in 2006 already a researcher

546
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,230
described the potential from the

547
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,379
Ferranti viruses to not protect the

548
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,870
system but to actually increase the

549
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,160
attack surface of the system by the

550
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,500
virtue of antivirus being vulnerable

551
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,610
itself and we also have some new

552
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,490
research that's happened in the past

553
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,649
three years a Google project zero tavis

554
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,540
wrote these lines these vulnerabilities

555
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,310
are as bad as it gets they don't require

556
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,950
any user interaction they affect the

557
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,300
default configuration and the software

558
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,440
runs at the highest possible privilege

559
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,430
which is of course one of ours does and

560
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,800
before that the result for research

561
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,900
which is which was titled killed by

562
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,790
proxy analyzing client and TLS digital

563
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,290
software but it was in large part about

564
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:39,020
antivirus because that's part of not

565
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:42,710
yours does it intercept intercept data

566
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,580
too before it accesses to the edge now

567
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,250
one more thing

568
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,800
what about non network attack vectors

569
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,690
remember we are talking about these

570
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,669
actors that are really sophisticated and

571
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,890
if any of you have by any chance looked

572
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,620
at the these leaks of Snowden of the

573
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,720
Taylor drug separation you will see that

574
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,100
many of their vectors that they use do

575
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,750
not have anything to do with software at

576
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:11,389
all so how do you protect against those

577
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,890
well again we need on device tools so

578
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,580
antivirus has to go back on the device

579
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:19,460
but it has to be a different antivirus

580
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,500
it has to look for commands in that

581
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,360
space and it has to analyze all input

582
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,310
channels traditional parse analyze what

583
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,699
network and this basically right

584
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:33,020
including certain discs but this tool if

585
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,940
we want to protect us from threats that

586
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,190
we haven't detected yet test analyze

587
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,020
everything and that includes you know on

588
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,130
the lowest level what's going on of the

589
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,170
USB bus right

590
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,160
maybe the malware is not on the disk

591
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,930
maybe it's not on the false identity

592
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,460
plugged in maybe the malware is in the

593
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:53,120
in the hardware side of the USB device

594
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:58,670
itself ata for hard drives network Y

595
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:02,419
over HDMI everything so I feel like

596
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:04,160
we're back in the 90s sorry in the 80s

597
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,920
when anti viruses were becoming popular

598
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,230
I see that

599
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,220
this is where it's going I'm not sure

600
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:15,700
but I would I would believe that that

601
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,930
that some agencies are probably already

602
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,970
implementing or have implementing

603
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,160
something like that for their in-house

604
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,890
used to protect against unknown Mulder

605
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,930
and I mean from one side it's really

606
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,450
nice to see that they are giving back to

607
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,430
the community anyone who sees to give

608
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,870
her by the by the NSA reverse

609
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,820
engineering framework I haven't I've

610
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,350
downloaded it just to make sure that

611
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,179
we've they change the version silently I

612
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,919
can compare the cash and and see what

613
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,330
changed because they published its what

614
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,030
appeared to be a hurry but probably I'm

615
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,770
wrong but I mean still we have this

616
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,660
distrust right those are the guys that

617
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:52,270
at least part of them tried to caucus so

618
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,650
okay but I think some of them make up

619
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,150
the software and I would really look

620
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,490
forward to them sharing their insights

621
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:00,850
because this is all as I promised hand

622
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:05,050
waving now finally I do recognize that

623
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:08,649
there is or rather there are some

624
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:10,240
problems with this proposal namely we

625
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:14,290
are not getting rid of the extra attack

626
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,480
surface anti viruses provide such a

627
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,399
large additional attack surface an

628
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,050
attacker in part because they are really

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,890
complex pieces of software now this new

630
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:29,680
idea 0x dead the time proposing is gonna

631
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:32,440
be even more complex if anyone tries to

632
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,630
implemented so it will certainly provide

633
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,070
extra tax service and and that has to be

634
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,870
recognized

635
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,340
I would simply move it was built away

636
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,800
from the apps and the operating system

637
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,330
to this one one one choke point but

638
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,450
again that's good because then we can

639
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,250
work on security over there at the same

640
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,530
time we get something new compared to

641
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,660
none to ours if if that gets implemented

642
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,810
in any reasonable technical way not a

643
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,840
lot and level and presented here then we

644
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,909
may gain some protection against

645
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,939
directed unpatched vulnerabilities so

646
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,320
what what was some what some people call

647
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,740
these apts right advanced persistent

648
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,260
threats so I'm looking forward to to

649
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,060
seeing how how that's gonna how that's

650
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,700
gonna end or how that's gonna start

651
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,300
cause it's going to be implemented

652
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,760
and this presentation was brought to you

653
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,490
by me talking to people for two years

654
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,560
and and and wording them you know but

655
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:30,800
bad guys could use automatic updates to

656
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:34,270
clear it up so that's it thank you

657
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,270
[Applause]
