1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:09,219
hey fantastic hello everybody how are

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,269
you all doing thank you very much oh

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:15,660
good excellent

4
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:18,400
pleased to hear it only for this right

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,660
my name is Graham I've been working in

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,630
computer security for about thirty years

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,259
as Gordon told you I started off way

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,839
back when in the dawn of time right

9
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,580
working for dr. Solomon's in fact I

10
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,949
think I was programmer number two or

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,120
three at the time Allen Solomon who

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,719
really does exist

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,110
Allen Solomon is not like John McAfee

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,860
who doesn't exist touch that's surely a

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,480
figment of someone's crazy imagination

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,550
no Allen Solomon really does exist and

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,760
he was doing all the work on the dust

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,699
version of topsail incentivised okay and

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,180
this thing called windows 3.0 was coming

20
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:00,339
out and he got me and he said great we

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,379
should or I want you to write the window

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,420
special I said you do understand Allen

23
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,520
that I've never written a Windows

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,049
program before it's not a problem he

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,880
says no one's gonna buy it

26
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,350
everyone's gonna buy the os/2 version he

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,479
said which was the best that he was

28
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,009
writing so I threw out the window first

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,619
remember pretty buttons and things like

30
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,119
that and turned out it was wrong so it's

31
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,470
very hard to make predictions about the

32
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,840
future and what's going to be successful

33
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,329
it's a bit like Betamax versus VHS in

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,210
fact if in fact I'm talking about VHS

35
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:36,130
video tape is already aged to me amongst

36
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,389
half of the audience in 32 another so

37
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,189
yeah so I've been working for a long

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,170
time for both dr. Saunders and I went to

39
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,059
suffice for a while last six years or so

40
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,340
I've been working for myself doing talks

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,820
doing podcasts writing blogging

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,140
generally been a bit of a loudmouth

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,570
about the subject computer security and

44
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,549
hopefully raising awareness as well

45
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,679
and if any of you do happen plug blood

46
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,619
blood to listen to my podcast come and

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,390
grab me in a break and I might have a

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,539
smashing security stick of you but do

49
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,770
not dare do not dare to try and claim

50
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,810
your sticker if you don't listen to the

51
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,600
podcast because I will ask you a very

52
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,520
very technical cryptic question which

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,239
only true listeners will know the answer

54
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,189
to

55
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,739
laughter he's just answered it yes does

56
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:22,189
it have a G or not okay so let's begin

57
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,650
my talk today is entitled not all cyber

58
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:27,108
criminals are evil geniuses and I hope

59
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,999
by the end of this presentation you will

60
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:33,079
agree with me but it is important first

61
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:35,769
of all to understand well where was the

62
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:39,109
public getting its perception of

63
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:43,340
cybercrime and who the bad guys actually

64
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:44,689
are so let's take a look let's take a

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:50,000
look at one example does anyone remember

66
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:52,909
these guys LulzSec yes

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,250
a notorious hacking gang who were not

68
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,798
only quite successful at breaking into

69
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,659
organizations and stealing dates from

70
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,449
embarrassing them or launching denial of

71
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,010
service attacks but also really good at

72
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,989
public relations

73
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,349
they had a very active Twitter account

74
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:10,849
if you remember and to be honest the guy

75
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,569
who was running the Twitter cam was

76
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:16,429
pretty funny and you would follow it and

77
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,099
many many people were following not only

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,060
for the latest stories of which

79
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,560
organizations they attacked but simply

80
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,019
because although they were doing very

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,620
naughty things they were also quite

82
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:31,099
amusing but one day we woke up to the

83
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,519
news in June 2011 that one of the

84
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:37,358
hackers had been caught and according to

85
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:41,209
the British media what we got here

86
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:44,030
world's number one hacker suspect is

87
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:48,829
Essex boy Essex teenager linked to wave

88
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:53,989
of global hacking police swooped on team

89
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:56,959
cyber mastermind etc etc and this is the

90
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,879
kind of thing which we were seen so

91
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,430
arrest was made after the spate of

92
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,668
attacks which were coming from law SEC

93
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,439
this is the independent report again

94
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:09,620
saying there and we've got a picture of

95
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,150
its ass and we saw the Daily Mail report

96
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,159
as well one things that the Daily Mail

97
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,049
loved to do is they love to tell you how

98
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:17,329
they give to give you details of the

99
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:20,810
house because with the Daily Mail it's

100
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,520
not only you know Royals or a celebrity

101
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,690
cellulite or something like that they

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,380
also want to keep you up to date on

103
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,630
house prices

104
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,880
the country and so they will give you

105
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,320
not only an estimate as to how much that

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,690
per house is worth and whether it's

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,219
detached or semi-detached but they also

108
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,490
if they manage to there they will also

109
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,200
print pictures of inside the house and

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,900
the hackers denon let's take a look

111
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,479
inside the teenager's bedroom this is

112
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,370
his actual bedroom right here

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,360
now you can tell instantly he's a hacker

114
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:54,780
because he has two computer monitors

115
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,670
what kind of twisted evil brain would be

116
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,770
able to cope with two monitors certainly

117
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,170
not me and in this is where's alleged to

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,900
have masterminded his cyber crime

119
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,160
attacks and all on the wall above the

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,349
monitors you can't see it terribly

121
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,000
clearly here but there a picture there's

122
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,420
a picture of two scantily clad women

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,070
with their bottoms in the air on the

124
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,870
poster up there above this monitor again

125
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,760
what kind of weird twisted perverted

126
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,290
mind is going on here

127
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,050
but you can also tell that this is a

128
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,390
teenage hackers a teenage Packers room

129
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,640
because look at this he is actually for

130
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,039
some reason covered his window with

131
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,110
tinfoil and he has some sort of air

132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,940
conditioning unit and any of you who

133
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,820
have teenage children particularly

134
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,190
teenage boys will understand the need to

135
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,110
recycle the air in that room as

136
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,730
regularly as possible particularly if

137
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,650
someone is the kind of person who would

138
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,950
spend a lot of time in their bedroom

139
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,539
maybe with two monitors and a big

140
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,200
painting of two ladies with their

141
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,440
bottoms in the air so the question which

142
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,810
the Daily Mail wanted answered was this

143
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,180
what does he look like an exclusive said

144
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:04,290
the Daily Mail we have the face of the

145
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,620
teenage cyber terrorist who would like

146
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,200
to see a picture of this twisted

147
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,580
individual anybody

148
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,270
yes scream you scream you scream and

149
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,640
it's bitterly serious this is the

150
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,849
picture of 19 year old according to the

151
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,620
Daily Mail Brian clean now clearly this

152
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,640
actually isn't a picture of him at 19

153
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,160
but they might forget his school

154
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,650
photograph so they grabbed a picture of

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,740
him at 13 and they put that on the front

156
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,320
of the Daily Mail newspaper and there it

157
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,210
was amongst all the other headlines and

158
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,710
some of the newspapers really went over

159
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,190
the top in the attacks if you think I've

160
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,890
been

161
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,150
slacking him off so far some of the

162
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,400
newspapers really went over the top

163
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,460
including the Sun newspaper who

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,630
described him as a nerdy geeky reclusive

165
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,609
oddball which frankly describes 2/3 of

166
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,350
us in this room let's be honest let's

167
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,790
take a long hard look at ourselves you

168
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,510
know we'd probably take off quite a few

169
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,490
things there

170
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,560
I think ourselves now this didn't go

171
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,520
down terribly well surprise surprise

172
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,390
with the hacking community and LulzSec

173
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:12,930
decided to get its revenge and what they

174
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:15,479
did was this if you went to the Sun

175
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,470
website after this report was published

176
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,560
just like a day later he saw this you

177
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,660
saw a news story that media moguls body

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,290
discovered and that Rupert Murdoch had

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,940
tripped over some topiary in his garden

180
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,650
cracked his head open

181
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,940
possibly inhaled some polonium and died

182
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,289
what the hackers had done is said not

183
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,450
actually two-faced

184
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,970
the sun's website they're not managed to

185
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,099
hack into the Sun website itself and

186
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,010
change the stories up there but they had

187
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,340
managed to alter and middle the Sun

188
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,320
websites DNS records which meant that

189
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,630
you were now being taken to a completely

190
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,419
different website when you typed in the

191
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,840
Sun coat UK and you're able to see this

192
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,370
fake story instead and that's the kind

193
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,320
of manipulation which hackers can often

194
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,300
do I remember that they're all clearly

195
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,000
they're not the only organisation which

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,470
has been hit by DNS hijacking like this

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,080
I remember this once happened to Twitter

198
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,270
and if you went to twitter.com you

199
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,039
didn't go to the real twitter.com you

200
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,169
actually end up on a de Faced website

201
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,470
which had a political message on it as

202
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,180
well from a middle-eastern group and the

203
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,470
media's instant reaction is all my

204
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,630
goodness they've been hacked were they

205
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,090
the part of them has been hacked or

206
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,159
their DNS registrar has been act but the

207
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,569
website itself hasn't been compromised

208
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,750
it's just that you're now going to

209
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,250
something else entirely but this is

210
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,900
where you're getting redirected if you

211
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,270
wanted headline news and that was the

212
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,470
harm of maybe describing people as nerdy

213
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,319
geeky reclusive audibles

214
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,260
but sure enough Ryan Cleary which was

215
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,440
his name was arrested and he did see

216
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,810
court there is a picture of him as a 19

217
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,610
year old when he was actually ultimately

218
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,469
sentenced but he got me thinking

219
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,280
he got me think you know the media often

220
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,310
will present these people has been you

221
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,720
know nerdy wolf sometimes say hacking

222
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,969
mastermind we were told he was the

223
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,410
number one hacking suspect in the world

224
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,840
I don't think so I think that may have

225
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,339
been something of a hyperbole but why

226
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,800
don't we get scientific about this why

227
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,100
don't we try and understand well who's

228
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,199
in the evil camp and what evil means and

229
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,510
it was in the genius camp and who's an

230
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,230
evil genius in the middle as well if we

231
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,270
can work that out

232
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,040
maybe we'll be some way to better

233
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,990
understanding what these hackers these

234
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,969
malicious hackers at least are really

235
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,100
like so I'm gonna put up in this player

236
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,860
game I'm gonna put up a series of

237
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,750
pictures of people and you can tell me

238
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,450
whether you think they're evil or

239
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,730
geniuses or both okay

240
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,450
could be interesting like let us begin

241
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,770
is everyone ready

242
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:56,330
do we need a thing right does anyone

243
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,040
know this chap I mean not personally

244
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:00,170
hopefully hope um got posters from up in

245
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,579
your rooms or anything like that it is

246
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,910
of course Adolf Hitler and he is very

247
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,650
good

248
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,420
it's always good to start a conference

249
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,300
like this to work out who the neo-nazis

250
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,620
might be in the room and we found out

251
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,650
that we haven't got very many here today

252
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,210
so he goes into the Venn diagram over on

253
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,310
this side and now let's have another

254
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,730
chat all right here's a chappie no no

255
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:25,040
this is Einstein absolutely now if we

256
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,960
were used in machine learning we might

257
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,260
determine that he's evil because he has

258
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,630
a mustache turns out not everyone with a

259
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,689
mustache is in fact evil for instance

260
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:38,150
Tom Selleck right magnum p.i not a bad

261
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,010
guy right Lionel Richie in his heyday

262
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,290
had a mustache don't think he does

263
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,569
anymore maybe does Evans dunno anyway

264
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,790
not a bad guy Lionel Richie so you don't

265
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,110
put people like that into the evil camp

266
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,640
so we have to have something at some

267
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,010
other way of determining who's evil

268
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,590
who's actually a genius here's another

269
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,360
one

270
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,910
Starlin one of every vein very bright

271
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,420
very bright group here

272
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,189
and I would argue that he is evil

273
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,290
absolutely I'm glad I would say the evil

274
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,710
genius so far like hey what's evil what

275
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,079
wasn't it brilliant no no no no we're

276
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,890
not going there okay let's let's let's

277
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,940
mess it up a bit

278
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,930
let's make it a little bit more

279
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,360
complicated right because you're getting

280
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,829
a bit cocky about how easy this is right

281
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,280
here's a mixed we're going to give you

282
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:25,930
two people or organisms what about this

283
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,600
there's a chap on the left what do you

284
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,760
think not Doctor Who no could happen

285
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,070
he's got an apple yes someone said it

286
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,189
mutant yes Isaac Newton this is a hassle

287
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,780
in iconic format falling beside him I'm

288
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,970
afraid I couldn't find a photograph of

289
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,439
Isaac Newton that's why I'm if you're

290
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,920
wondering about this and of course the

291
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,540
Daleks any opinions what about Isaac

292
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,760
mention genius I agree

293
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:55,140
darlings bad guys not good at all

294
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,340
another one we'll be thinking about here

295
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,790
[Music]

296
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,430
that's not Davros that's that's Stephen

297
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,660
Hawking and the batsman to represent da

298
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,459
Vinci okay

299
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,650
so again right both geniuses in their

300
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,670
own way all right you think this is a

301
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,050
simple game Bren

302
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,979
thank you for introducing us to this

303
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,359
game I don't think we're gonna be

304
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,320
playing at our Christmas party

305
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,390
well let me make it a bit more

306
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,390
complicated let's bring on the big guns

307
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,970
right who have we got here

308
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:39,050
Clippy what's your opinion damn right

309
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:45,860
Phil Collins genius I'm sorry there's a

310
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:47,209
problem with PowerPoint all right well

311
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,070
we're getting quite good at this let's

312
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,310
take a look at some upper examples this

313
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,720
guy's Albert Gonzalez and Al Gore Tom

314
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,040
Hollis made a name for himself some

315
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,140
years ago because he was running a

316
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,170
hacking game he was the mastermind of

317
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,510
the group for each hacked t.j.maxx or

318
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,610
some mythical TK Maxx they stole 40

319
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:08,390
million credit card details and then a

320
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,940
further 130 million credit card details

321
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,199
from Heartland Payment Systems and one

322
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,670
of the ways in which they were able to

323
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,000
do that is TK Maxx and Heartland were

324
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,469
using as their wireless protocol WEP

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,990
right which as we all know is super

326
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,339
super easy to crack easy to intercept

327
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,070
and get the information so they were

328
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:31,040
using an old outdated cracked wireless

329
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,870
protocol and so the hacker was able to

330
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,149
steal the information and they his gang

331
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,300
cloned cards they stole details they

332
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:41,630
stole a fortune for n cash machines now

333
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,890
he was caught he was grabbed because one

334
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,890
day an FBI guy

335
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,020
actually spotted him acting suspiciously

336
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,360
as an ATM probably would have a great

337
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,220
big you know dozen burgers ain't stoppin

338
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,140
it full of cash as it was crashing out

339
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,370
and when they caught him and they

340
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,680
realized what he had been doing they

341
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,959
said look pains I said no obviously what

342
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,899
you've been doing is a bit naughty but

343
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:05,239
do you want to work for us maybe you can

344
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,850
give us some information on other

345
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,350
hacking gangs and Gonzalez he was

346
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,490
looking at being locked up for years and

347
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,520
years and years the rest of his life

348
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,680
maybe said yeah I'll do that of course

349
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,220
I'll help you

350
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,219
but what he also did was he carried on

351
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,350
hacking and he carried on stealing tens

352
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,959
of millions of credit card details and

353
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:32,060
so when you ask yourself is this guy

354
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:34,150
evil or a genius I'd say not a genius

355
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,609
not that smell

356
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:41,160
even given that lifeline he carried on

357
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:43,030
hacking and yeah not good for him

358
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,750

379
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,830
into a Labour and FIFA website I changed

380
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:16,150
up all the stuff in there to say nice

381
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:18,910
things about Tories funny she says that

382
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,530
she met to crime and I was interested so

383
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,329
this this video appeared thank you

384
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,380

385
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,450
again but thank you very much

386
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,430
to our sound chap there for jumping in

387
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,230
and risk anything so I was interesting

388
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,390
where this video came out of this woman

389
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,590
so that she hacked into a label website

390
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,290
about ten years ago

391
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,240
I thought I wonder what website that was

392
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,400
I wonder what happened and so I did a

393
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,230
little bit of searching around on the

394
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,170
internet and I found this news story

395
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,399
here it is from 2000

396
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,860
mate someone hacked into the website of

397
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,040
labour party deputy leader at the time

398
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,620
Harriet Harman and they up she's

399
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,290
obviously labour and they updated her

400
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,510
website to say that she had changed

401
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,599
sides and she's now decided to become a

402
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,559
Tory and she was back in a chap who may

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,339
not have heard of him called Boris

404
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,189
Johnson who was hoping to be London

405
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,129
mayor now you may think well there must

406
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,720
be really clever to hack into you have

407
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,089
to be quite a genius to hack into a

408
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,809
website not in the case of Harriet

409
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:27,418
Harmons website because turned out

410
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,270
choice of username and password not that

411
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:32,610
sophisticated and so that was Kimmie

412
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,179
better not and the woman who targeted

413
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:39,870
Harriet Harmons website I wonder what

414
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:46,080
happened to chemi pattern och I wonder

415
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:48,149
what she might be doing now oh she's a

416
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,530
member of Parliament's for Safra warden

417
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,600
parliamentary Under Secretary of State

418
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:56,700
for children and families and her boss

419
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,730
is a person called well done very good

420
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,140
Boris Johnson quite astonishing so some

421
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,809
of the people we have representing us

422
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,419
back in the UK I have actually admitted

423
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,820
quite openly doing hacking hacking mean

424
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,799
being juvenile being untrustworthy who

425
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,780
would have imagined that that a

426
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,790
politician could possibly in it you know

427
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,678
very graciously Harriet Harman said I

428
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,809
don't really care about this let's just

429
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,770
move on she's apologized but if you

430
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:26,100
asked yourself is she an evil genius I'd

431
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,960
say well certainly no genius I don't

432
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,770
think so didn't require that much

433
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,860
sophistication someone else then this

434
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,900
chap is a chap called Michael Bowen and

435
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,520
Michael Byrne was based in the

436
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,650
Philippines and Michael Byrne was the

437
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,780
best mate of someone else called onel to

438
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,850
Gusman you may know onel de Guzman you

439
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,160
may have received an email which he

440
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,469
wrote the email read kindly read the

441
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,950
attached love letter coming from me and

442
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,710
it

443
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:55,200
spread on may the 4th mm he was the

444
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,730
author of the love bug worm which forded

445
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,679
itself to everybody in your dress look

446
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,510
at the time it was the biggest worm ever

447
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,230
this guy isn't the guy who wrote the

448
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,169
love bug

449
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:07,080
this is his mate own l2 Koosman but he

450
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:09,570
also was writing malware in the

451
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,090
Philippines and what he did was he wrote

452
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,668
a piece of malware which did do

453
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,740
something quite evil in fact so bad so

454
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:20,100
evil that I'm not going to show you on

455
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,200
the screen with Clippy because it did

456
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,090
use Clippy but in this case I'm not

457
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,909
going to replace it with the Albert

458
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:30,240
Einstein icon it usefully to post up a

459
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:33,059
random quote as it infected your Word

460
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,880
documents but it also took over your

461
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,668
printers and at the end of the month

462
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,250
his virus displayed a message so if I

463
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:44,490
don't get a job by the end of this month

464
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:48,389
I'm going to release another virus which

465
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,970
will what does it say it will perricone

466
00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,250
our ring phenom at Ang's hard disk mode

467
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,980
which is Tagalog for I'm going to shag

468
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,899
your hard drive and so wipe your hard

469
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,059
drive and he printed out this warning on

470
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:03,418
your printers and he said if you don't

471
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,950
give me a job now how are we going to

472
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,960
resolve this problem well you see

473
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,059
Michael Bouin had had an idea

474
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,799
he didn't just print out that threat he

475
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:15,090
followed up that threat on his printer

476
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:23,190
with a printout of his entire CV name

477
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:25,230
address phone number genius genius no no

478
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,789
no let's take a look at this guy I've

479
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,830
had to pick slate out of his eyes I

480
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,049
can't show you his true identity this

481
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,240
guy is a member of a gang called the

482
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:35,158
Syrian electronic army the Syrian

483
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,019
electronic army were quite famous like

484
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,059
LulzSec for hacking into media

485
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:42,570
organizations there are pro-assad

486
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,879
hacking gang they were making menaces

487
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,010
but they also breaking into

488
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,529
organizations stealing data and rather

489
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,510
like Brian was saying hold and holding

490
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:55,830
those companies ransom and saying unless

491
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:58,169
you pay us money we are going to release

492
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,059
your data onto the Internet and that

493
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,740
will be embarrassing to you and I used

494
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,970
to get email

495
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,850
from people like the Syrian electronic

496
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,830
army myself saying hey we've hacked this

497
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,290
organization here is some of the data

498
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,699
we've stolen from them would you like to

499
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,730
write about it because they won't pay

500
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,360
the ransom and I would say no I'm not

501
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,100
going to be party to your extortion plot

502
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,139
go to vice or something like that and

503
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,240
they see if they're right about it but

504
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,950
it wasn't really my cup of tea but they

505
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,990
had a problem they had a problem when

506
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,250
they were extorting money and the clues

507
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,210
in their name because they were the

508
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,700
Syrian electronic army which meant

509
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:37,309
sanctions which meant it wasn't easy to

510
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,250
move money to Syria now why they weren't

511
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:42,170
using a cryptocurrency I have no idea

512
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,100
but they were actually asking for cold

513
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:48,620
real money and they used to negotiate

514
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,699
with the companies as to how to do that

515
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,340
and they would say look we realize

516
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,980
because we're in Syria it's hard to wire

517
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,840
the money to us but we have go-betweens

518
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,890
we have a go-between for instance in

519
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,120
Germany who you can work with and so

520
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,690
they would say to these companies well

521
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,610
if you send us so many thousand euros to

522
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,309
our contact in Germany here's his name

523
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,530
his name is Pierre Roma he lives in the

524
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:16,730
town of Waterhouse and in the middle of

525
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:20,149
Germany then you can we can do the deal

526
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:22,190
and they would even give the targeted

527
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,050
company the hacked company Pierre's

528
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,380
email address so they could make contact

529
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:29,149
directly oh and obviously that must be a

530
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,860
pseudonym right the you wouldn't they

531
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,350
wouldn't give they wouldn't use his real

532
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,270
name in the email address which he's

533
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,350
using for the extortion plot now I don't

534
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,639
know if any of you have worked for

535
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,070
really large companies I've worked for

536
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,480
fairly large companies before and one of

537
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,149
the biggest obstacles to getting

538
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,030
anything done I found in business is the

539
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,700
legal department because I would want to

540
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,920
do something in my department and legal

541
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,450
or Health and Safety would say you can't

542
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,640
do that grounds it's technically against

543
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,890
the law or you know people will get

544
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,750
killed or something like that you know

545
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,220
whatever it is you're doing is two days

546
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,380
there's nothing I'll give me a break

547
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,540
just let me do my job no no no Graham is

548
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,550
too dangerous well similarly if your

549
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,840
company is ever blackmailed by cyber

550
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,300
criminals you may find it very

551
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,919
frustrating

552
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,510
the legal department want to get

553
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,220
involved and that's what happened in

554
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,870
this particular case the legal

555
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,690
department of this US company got

556
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:23,139
involved and said look if we pay this

557
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,240
money to our extortionist where's the

558
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,920
guarantee that they won't release our

559
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,500
data there's quite a reasonable question

560
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,590
to ask you know how can we be sure and

561
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,830
the legal department said why don't we

562
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:38,980
write up a contract so we will write up

563
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,379
a contract right and we will send it to

564
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,730
them saying you agree you know once we

565
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,410
paid you this money that you will

566
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,120
destroy all copies of the data and you

567
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,320
will not release it in everywhere and

568
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,790
they sent this to Pierre Omar working

569
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,820
for the Syrian electronic army and they

570
00:23:51,790 --> 00:24:01,680
said can you sign this name address scan

571
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:05,860
of your passport and that's what he did

572
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,960
scanned in this box so if you're gonna

573
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,959
say yes yes of course we'd love to pay

574
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,610
you up bloody legal department however

575
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,770
demand that you fill in all this

576
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:16,149
information for us definitely thing are

577
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,010
great we're gonna get some money yeah

578
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,460
we're gives them all that you know time

579
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:24,820
for the police to come round everything

580
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:28,270
so yeah it's not gonna end well genius

581
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,870
genius evil maybe a little bit evil

582
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:34,060
genius no I would say not and the thing

583
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,000
is that greed doesn't discriminate right

584
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,980
he catches out both the smart and the

585
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,990
done and went something like that an

586
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,690
opportunity for these hackers to make a

587
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,820
quick buck comes along common sense can

588
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:49,120
just completely evaporate from their

589
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,950
mind you know we're all stupid we're all

590
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,159
cavemen in many ways this entire

591
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,110
industry is based upon the fact that we

592
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,750
haven't managed to roll out a patch for

593
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,060
the human brain yet it's because we keep

594
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,890
on making the same mistakes we keep on

595
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,480
blundering in our male singer gets all

596
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,300
twitchy at the thought of clicking on a

597
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,490
an image of Anna Kournikova or upstaged

598
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,560
myself Jennifer Lopez I'm still not

599
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,030
doing any better whoever I can't mention

600
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,310
anyone currents and they seem like a

601
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,050
dirty old man now aren't I so I don't

602
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,429
know

603
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:24,540
this does move on move on grip so cyber

604
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:27,270
criminals are they evil geniuses I'd say

605
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,440
they're not all evil and they're not all

606
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,129
geniuses either

607
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,870
I think there's plenty of evidence that

608
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,430
some of them aren't very smart some of

609
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,350
them made us be misguided some of them

610
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,180
made us being desperate straights to

611
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,980
make some cash in this opportunity as

612
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,900
arisen to them and the power of the

613
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,910
Internet has given them this ability to

614
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,000
cause all kinds of mischief and they may

615
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,350
not be either actually they may just be

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,930
people who just need to be steered

617
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,120
slightly in a different direction I feel

618
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:56,880
very uncomfortable with calling anybody

619
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,350
truly evil other than Phil Collins and

620
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,620
clipping so good people sometimes will

621
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:09,300
do very bad things and sometimes bad

622
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:11,969
people do dumb things as well but maybe

623
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,070
sometimes that just be in this other

624
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:18,630
category which is what I like to call

625
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:20,550
wombats and again our industry is based

626
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,370
upon the fact that we are all one bets

627
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:28,110
we get distracted we get confused we get

628
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:30,540
flustered we make mistakes and so it's

629
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,350
very easy for all of us to be in that

630
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,490
category as well so rather than

631
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,679
splitting people up like this and

632
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,200
assuming that every hacker out there is

633
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,730
a criminal mastermind when clearly as we

634
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,530
saw from Brian's presentation earlier

635
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,530
some of the techniques being used are

636
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,120
not sophisticated they're not

637
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,620
groundbreaking and actually maybe that

638
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,870
is the clever thing maybe the clever

639
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,699
thing is that you said theythey that

640
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,780
either they were lazy Brian Eno it's not

641
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,850
very smart busting and we're actually

642
00:26:54,780 --> 00:27:00,060
maybe these smart to be lazy

643
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,129
maybe if something is working then the

644
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,530
smart thing to do is just keep on doing

645
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,840
it because why go to the extra effort of

646
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,540
being more sophisticated and many of

647
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,159
these hackers I find it difficult to put

648
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,190
them in the evil or genius camp

649
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,980
completely but they certainly would

650
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,480
appear in the warm batch camp and maybe

651
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,120
that's where they should be

652
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,850
instead I hope that's been interesting

653
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,600
you thank you very much

654
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:32,168
[Applause]

655
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,730
I don't know if anyone has any question

656
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,250
more questions could you possibly have

657
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,750
any points normally when you ask people

658
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,639
for questions actually so I don't have a

659
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,309
question I just have a statement which I

660
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:45,939
wish to make demonstrating how clever I

661
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:52,899
am and yes I thought you look like the

662
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:55,000
kind of person yes far be it for me to

663
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:57,219
plug something up on stage here at Iris

664
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,759
con we what we talk about on the podcast

665
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,169
is about the quirky stories which have

666
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,840
happened in the last week what we try to

667
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:06,370
do is we make the subject computer

668
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,220
security accessible to everyone because

669
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,600
I think there's a problem whereby

670
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,340
there's too many nerds speaking to other

671
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,500
nerds I think it's a problem whereby

672
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,449
some security podcasts are quite

673
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,799
exclusive and they've got great legal

674
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,240
content if you want to get into the

675
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,799
interrupt vector registers and if you

676
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,460
want to get into the registry Keys

677
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,649
that's smashing but we need to get the

678
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,110
general public interested in online

679
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:30,549
privacy and securing their devices and

680
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,889
things for that so we're just trying to

681
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,389
do it in an accessible way and normally

682
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:36,428
it's a load of old rubbish to be honest

683
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:38,428
but it comes out every week

684
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:41,110
does anyone listen smashing security

685
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:44,740
handsome yes very handsome guests like

686
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:48,100
Brian Holden as well suddenly no one's

687
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:58,990
interested random survivor any any other

688
00:28:48,100 --> 00:29:02,439
questions it's difficult isn't it I have

689
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,879
to admit I think rather like the

690
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,200
situation we have in the news at the

691
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:09,158
moment right where there's a very

692
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:14,309
high-profile individual who didn't

693
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:16,419
properly express remorse it's hard for

694
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,350
observers to move on I think I have a

695
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:19,299
problem with that

696
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,189
I've a problem when people have done

697
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,889
something bad if I don't really feel

698
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,230
that they're sorry about what they did

699
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:28,870
then I find it difficult to sort of

700
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,299
embrace them myself and that has been

701
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,610
true of some notorious hackers in the

702
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:35,440
past who've done things and it made a

703
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,090
name for themselves and then end up on

704
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,639
the speaking circuit or whatever and

705
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,510
they may be great speakers but I just

706
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:45,299
want them to say you know what I will

707
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:47,280
and you shouldn't do why did rather than

708
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:49,049
sort of reveling in the notoriety and

709
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,309
some people haven't done that some

710
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:52,860
people have been very good about moving

711
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:54,500
on I was at an event just a couple of

712
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,120
weeks ago one of the speaker's was a

713
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,059
former member of anonymous who did some

714
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,860
naughty stuff and I listened to his talk

715
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,299
and I thought you're not really sorry

716
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,559
about this you got caught by the FBI

717
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,840
you're sore about getting caught by the

718
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,928
FBI but you still kind of think what you

719
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,030
did was cool and it wasn't cool because

720
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,620
all of us use the internet and little

721
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,480
old ladies using Internet to keep in

722
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,879
touch with their grandchildren on the

723
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,640
other side of the world and you've made

724
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,650
the Internet less of a comforting and

725
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
embracing thing for the general public

726
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:28,919
so I'd certainly believe that everyone

727
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:33,000
can be rehabilitated and can be brought

728
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:35,070
back but I do want to genuinely feel

729
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,289
that they think what they did in the

730
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,700
past was wrong and do something to

731
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:40,049
ensure that other people don't follow

732
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,720
too strongly in their footsteps

733
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,980
what annoys me is there are people who

734
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,750
sometimes do things which aren't

735
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,200
terribly sophisticated not terribly

736
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:52,440
clever and are heralded by the media as

737
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,330
being genius hackers and yet what they

738
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,940
proved was that they were ethically

739
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,730
immature and childish and maybe

740
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,120
malicious and there are plenty of good

741
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:05,250
guys and girls in this industry who when

742
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,260
they were teenagers decided no I'm not

743
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,669
going to do that I'm not going to hack

744
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,230
into someone's account I'm not going to

745
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:12,840
make someone's life a misery I'm not

746
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:15,720
going to mean that these IT guys have to

747
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,220
work overtime fixing a problem or fixing

748
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,320
a website and they miss their daughter's

749
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,270
birthdays or whatever because of my

750
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,610
immaturity and I think those are the

751
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,918
people who should be heralded and

752
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:29,100
applauded but often they're the ones who

753
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,700
don't make a name for themselves I've

754
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,699
got one fact

755
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:45,479
yes yeah yes she hacks labor yeah and

756
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:46,920
it's a news item but with your position

757
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,770
on people like that

758
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,140
but basically never be prospered but

759
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:56,160
it's technically a crime right because

760
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,600
under the CFA yeah she committed a crime

761
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,880
and what we got there is video of her

762
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,459
ten years later as an MP laughing about

763
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,080
it thinking it's funny I think it's not

764
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,930
a great role model is it but frankly

765
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,649
what great role models do we have in

766
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,410
politics right now Liz you know there's

767
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:15,990
a few there's a few Romans out there at

768
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,590
the moment so yeah it makes me

769
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,420
uncomfortable

770
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,159
I don't know if it's really in the

771
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,560
public interest to pursue a case like

772
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,690
that it doesn't appear that anyone has

773
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,550
actually you know Harriet Harman clearly

774
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,350
doesn't want to pursue it I those in a

775
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,500
long time and maybe no real damage has

776
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:35,100
been done in retrospect but it doesn't

777
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,650
give a great role model for children

778
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,340
does it who might not be tempted to

779
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,170
other things

780
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,340
just like other things not just

781
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,050
cybercrime and hacking

782
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,030
many people would argue for instance the

783
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,560
u.s. president in the moment it's not a

784
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,840
great role model for children he's a

785
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,010
great model for four-year-olds who want

786
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,070
to become five-year-olds

787
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,650
but not a great role model for people

788
00:32:53,070 --> 00:33:15,720
who want to be adults one day no

789
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:17,220
questions yes chef over there I don't

790
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,890
know where the breaking point other than

791
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,300
it's probably broken it's probably

792
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,670
something which is really quite fragile

793
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,950
I mean there is this huge danger that

794
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,450
when a hack occurs fingers begin to get

795
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,910
pointed in this obviously very very

796
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,740
difficult to reliably attribute where an

797
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,120
attack might have come from and there's

798
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,700
a tendency particularly amongst the

799
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,159
media not to get want to get into that

800
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,900
kind of detail and the granularity

801
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,179
because it becomes a more complicated

802
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,220
story we saw in the UK

803
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:48,269
just a couple of weeks ago the Labour

804
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,399
Party their website suffered a DDoS and

805
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:53,009
it was presented as a highly

806
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,949
sophisticated cyberattack now us in this

807
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:59,070
room know a democracy know a DDoS is not

808
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,210
a highly sophisticated cyberattack but

809
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,220
for the general public

810
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,100
that sounds really scary and you begin

811
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,389
to think Oh could it be the Russians

812
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,699
could it be the Conservatives could be

813
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:11,069
Boris you know it's in refresh on his

814
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:13,230
brows are multiple times know what could

815
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:15,119
be happening know because of that and

816
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,168
and maybe I don't know why they said

817
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,119
that maybe they said that because

818
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:19,918
they're not very technical themselves

819
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,359
maybe they were advised that maybe

820
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,848
because they thought it would be

821
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,980
embarrassing to say we were affected by

822
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,899
a really trivial juvenile cyberattack

823
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,809
which any 13 year old could have pulled

824
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:38,909
off hard to say yes question middle a

825
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:40,889
big one could it be Entebbe bad knock oh

826
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,869
who did it only give the ddos well maybe

827
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,040
you know I guess they've all got a few

828
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,559
weeks off at the moment are they and

829
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:51,989
they're not very busy until the election

831
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,799

832
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:57,270
come to my first iris gun and I hope you

833
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:58,980

834
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,670

835
