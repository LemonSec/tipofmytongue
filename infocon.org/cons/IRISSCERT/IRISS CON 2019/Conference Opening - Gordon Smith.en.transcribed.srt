1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,820
okay we'll get started good morning

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,799
everybody and you're very welcome to

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,610
Iris con the Irish Sauber home

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:18,039
conference 2019 edition many of you

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,679
might not know this but it was 10 years

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,470
ago to the week that the very first

7
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,630
Irish con was held in what's now set of

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,369
apartment blocks what was a hotel just

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,349
around the corner from here a much much

10
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,730
smaller room which gives a sense really

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,560
of how the conference has grown over the

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,780
past 10 years it's really become a

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,270
fixture in the Irish Information

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,820
Security seen over the past 10 years and

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,079
we've seen a huge amount of change in

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,270
that time I mean one thing that's been

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,160
striking and coming to it toward the

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,379
conference as I have done every year is

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,898
how much security become so much more of

20
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,230
a mainstream subject back in 2009 it was

21
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,829
quite a

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,199
anisha area but now data breaches and

23
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,030
major attacks are front-page news

24
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,410
you know I was doing well at the time

25
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,000
working as a journalist to get a story

26
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,000
of buried in the business pages about

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,989
say yeah security breach so things have

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
definitely moved on since then

29
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,610
Security's so much more part of the

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,380
conversation than it used to be now we

31
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,890
see for example the World Economic Forum

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,320
rates cyberattacks as one of its top 5

33
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,479
global risks now of course there's a

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,798
downside of that as well you you get an

35
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,048
awful lot of their people into the

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,939
industry I see Donald Trump's lawyer in

37
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,979
console Gary Rudy Giuliani is actually

38
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:29,559
passing himself off as a Cypress our

39
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,090
he's a getting speaking engagements

40
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,670
doing that which is pretty staggering

41
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,899
but it reminds me of the football chant

42
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,640
you'll hear at a terrorist sometimes

43
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:41,860
against the worst player on the pitch if

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,049
Rudy can talk cyber so can i but the one

45
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,579
thing is you can't say that certainly

46
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,590
about any of the speakers that we've got

47
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,689
lined up for you today it's an

48
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,100
absolutely superb lineup I was looking

49
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,199
at my speaking notes from last year in

50
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,089
fact and I said at the time and mentis

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,759
that it was the best lineup yet for iris

52
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,079
Khan and as the announcement started

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,460
coming in about speakers throughout the

54
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,288
course of the summer in the autumn I

55
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,699
just had to go back over and say look

56
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,909
I'm just gonna have to reuse that line

57
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,890
it truly is a fantastic lineup

58
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,140
speaking of reuse another big hot golden

59
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,970
subject is sustainability I'll be making

60
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,349
my own small contribution to that my

61
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,299
speaking notes will contain

62
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:21,040
4% recycled material by the way for

63
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:22,599
anybody who doesn't know me my name is

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,159
Gordon Smith I used to be a technology

65
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,590
journalist but I'm better now

66
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,929
it's my great honor and privilege to

67
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,599
welcome all of the speakers and all of

68
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,239
you here today we have as I've mentioned

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,339
such a distinguished and diverse group

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,469
of guests here today the mix of Irish

71
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,180
and international speakers some of whom

72
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,709
were welcoming back some of whom you

73
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,590
won't have seen before and in fact are

74
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,810
making their iris Khan debuts so we're

75
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,819
delighted to have them one thing I've

76
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,139
noticed again ever since 2009 it was

77
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,719
there when I was thinking back to the

78
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,879
very first conference how sharing

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,189
information has really been a constant

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,918
ruling team from Iris Khan since the

81
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,569
very very beginning it's it's been there

82
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,620
ever since so the speakers that you're

83
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:04,238
gonna hear from today are going to share

84
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,180
their knowledge two perspectives their

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,469
expertise one great thing speaking as a

86
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,819
kind of outsider I mean I've been

87
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:12,189
emptying this gig for quite a few years

88
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:15,578
now but I still think of myself as such

89
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,040
and you get no sales pitches no vendor

90
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,439
hype no fear uncertainty and doubt it's

91
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,448
just information security professionals

92
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,948
sharing best practice sharing their

93
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,439
knowledge helping to improve the

94
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,699
community and the organizations that we

95
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,138
work for and I think that's that's a

96
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,509
really loadable goal and a fantastic

97
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:33,069
thing to be doing now just to give you a

98
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,619
quick flavor of what's on the menu for

99
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,319
today a quick taste or if you like

100
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,720
you're gonna hear about patching red and

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,869
blue team's cyber security trends

102
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,849
reports skills a little bit about the

103
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,030
dark side of the internet social

104
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,369
engineering the human factor in security

105
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,449
and a scientist is going to give you a

106
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,769
step-by-step guide to cooking crab

107
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,969
that's what it says here anyway so I

108
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,709
supposed to paraphrase the late great

109
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:02,049
Gaber and there's something for everyone

110
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,400
in the audience now as well as the

111
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,259
fantastic presentations you're going to

112
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,639
hear today we've also got the annual

113
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,849
capture the flag event which is running

114
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,609
next door in association with Iris cert

115
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,439
and IBM teams will be competing against

116
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,000
each other for points we'll be

117
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,620
announcing the winner later on today I

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
definitely encourage you to go and check

119
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,739
that out that's that's well worth

120
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,690
looking at and particularly from the

121
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,549
standpoint of seeing all the possible

122
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,219
ways that an intruder or

123
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,370
could get into your systems so the does

124
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,349
plenty of learning to be had there - I

125
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,539
know word as well about our sponsors

126
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:36,280
it's thanks to them that an event like

127
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,810
this can take place I really would

128
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,179
encourage you during the coffee breaks

129
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,250

really appreciate your support in return

133
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,289

134
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,460
just name them now phonetically order

135
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:57,849

the hashtag by risk-on that's RI

152
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,289
ss co n we also have as we have had over

153
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,750
the past couple of years we've got

154
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,310
Cooper here recording most of the

155
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,169
presentations and they'll be made

156
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,029
available in due course on the iris

157
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,169
search YouTube channel so I would

158
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:55,000
encourage you to check those out because

159
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,039
as I've said you're going to come away

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,870
with an awful lot of fantastic material

161
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,150
to bring back to your organization's and

162
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,150
just to maybe reshape the way you think

163
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,008
about your work so with that I'll open

164
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,500
the conference formally by introducing

165
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,909
our first speaker he too has been a

166
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,740
