and so I'm going to present our humans

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,850
of one of those well before I start I

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,310
want to say a thanks to Brian forgive me

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:01:10,530
the opportunity to speak ours come today

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:01:12,780
so we're gonna start off with Who am I

7
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,460
so my name is Emma I'm Ashlyn I'm a

8
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,159
third year student in technology lien

9
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,350
first student and instead in

10
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,799
cybersecurity and digital forensics true

11
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,780
this I play CTF so my work is in

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,780
part-time security analyst or odd stuff

13
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:35,999
so yeah sorry

14
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,460
and so I also play CTF son true like

15
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:41,310
school I've always wants to be a maths

16
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,899
eternal wasn't Center where I wanted to

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,539
go to one three months each until you

18
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,759
two accountancy and things didn't go my

19
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,909
way and I don't aside straight to come

20
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,670
back in June 2016 and I kind of led me

21
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,639
to around I just like suicide security

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,060
and true that I'm at a few my lectures

23
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:03,420
they they have strong CTF which is zero

24
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,119
days then so my computer and sure that I

25
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,679
got onto the national team for armed has

26
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,420
sort of compete there and depressed

27
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:11,420
sterner Anya this year and

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,500
secure that that's my passion of

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,140
cybersecurity months at Mathematica

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,330
logical problem solving and so I'm gonna

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,660
go on to do we feel that humans are from

32
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,069
bility to companies and well simple

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,609
answer is yes I've hunted a

34
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:38,988
vulnerability to any region already so I

35
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,750
think that we do and so she was further

36
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,519
I'm gonna go on to my own fish or

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,379
spearfishing experience true in the

38
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,510
summer I started with the internship

39
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,129
four nights gun and I tweeted about

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,340
straighten and it's gone how excited I

41
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,798
was

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,329
I drew this I had a lot of people

43
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,930
congratulating the same welder on that

44
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:59,150
was great

45
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,040
then I tweeted this that I found a ball

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,709
gun or what looked like a ball done to

47
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,400
her which wasn't a local about me so I

48
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:10,849
posted this and had loads people like

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,370
you know get in contact say here's what

50
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:17,750
you could do here some suggestions but I

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,299
had one guy on he was a bit like oh DME

52
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,359
he tweeted a couple times under my post

53
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:25,250
smells like okay yeah ground so I opened

54
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,540
my DM that message me and he was like oh

55
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,359
hey like you can do they're seeking

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,888
duple panties sitting so I had a look

57
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,709
and then I kind of gave up the whole

58
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,510
book because it wasn't a book and then

59
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,269
kind of few days later he kept texting

60
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,149
me and saying oh you know what's this

61
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,880
terrain for so he asked me about a

62
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:48,079
domain I had been scanning the company's

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,180
Network obviously homes kinda didn't

64
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,919
reply didn't wanna you know reveal too

65
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,629
much information laughter it could have

66
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,430
been a security breach

67
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,739
could've been a serious security breach

68
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,690
if I had just given any information to

69
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:04,489
this guy and crying alarm bells to me

70
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,959
cuz you know I don't he started a

71
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,579
nightstand a couple weeks and I'm just

72
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,419
this guy you know getting a contact so

73
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,980
you know I think what's this yo for so

74
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,690
it was kind of like as if he saw me as

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,149
the weakling for the company and also

76
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,120
for mobility to company so then when

77
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,500
they got me thinkin he sent me a message

78
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm a good hacker and I don't talk you

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:30,040
don't worry and I'm right

80
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:31,420
okay so I kind of I was picking about us

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,430
so it's like I'll check out his profile

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,770
look this profile not sees a

83
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,330
Piketon hacker so whatever app lights

84
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,810
and hackers I'm not sure and if anyone

85
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,669
knows you can let me know and so after

86
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,470
this he kind of we had reached the line

87
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,750
he kept asking random questions like oh

88
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,460
just study here and you do this and you

89
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,930
work this and you know he knew my

90
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,120
birthday he knew what our information

91
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,890
from my LinkedIn account which I put all

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,770
the information on late dinner Twitter

93
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,960
that I want people to know and so he had

94
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,789
enough information if you had asked me

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,700
what my dog's name was he for me got

96
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:06,550
into my email or whatever and so I

97
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,700
blocked him good-bye tumble through the

98
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,350
whole process of learning from this I'd

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,570
record of Bryan's made sure that the

100
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,030
company was aware that this guy had

101
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,310
asked me what this you're Alice for and

102
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,070
not thought I gave them any information

103
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,680
about the company well if he had a tried

104
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,190
anything like any attacks against D or

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,690
another and so and so I'd love to what

106
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,370
triggers I kind of learned less than

107
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,680
that I should have opened my dancer

108
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,230
destoy and I should always be wary who

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,400
he adds you know how much he gives these

110
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,660
people like they're experts in the

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,370
fields we don't actually know what

112
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,320
they're doing they could look friendly

113
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,940
but not friendlier you know voice first

114
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,860
this boy could lock he might not have

115
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,750
been malicious but then he could have a

116
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,510
malicious we kinda had to be very very

117
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,370
so kind of got me tink and then like I'm

118
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,099
not the only one disaster carpenter so I

119
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,890
kind of started research and I find this

120
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,620
treaty today and so someone was a

121
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,659
vulnerability for accompanying or such

122
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,490
lots of people use like Instagram and

123
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,020
Twitter and you know sometimes we don't

124
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,540
think when we're posting are we post of

125
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,580
them obviously this person would pull a

126
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,290
picture of so basically the two guys

127
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,359
they're famous and this person took the

128
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,490
picture of them if you can't really see

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,530
it on the board either and but you can

130
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,140
see the gmail password on the email

131
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,479
account was also in the picture a

132
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:28,150
stranger had no assistant said oh look

133
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,520
there's actually a father

134
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,849
so basically accidentally leaked and

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,719
emails and dmoz a lack of attention I am

136
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,349
putting the planes

137
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,659
the credentials and this was pop wife

138
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,938
doesn't know my work had come here as

139
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,699
such and then another one was I'm not

140
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:49,599
sure if anyone knows their Equifax admin

141
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:51,639
admin and so that was another human

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,669
error like no one changed the default of

143
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,389
the password and you have your admin

144
00:06:54,669 --> 00:07:00,878
admin you know why don't we use key pass

145
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,860
or you know password managers is such

146
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,019
we'll just remember one long strong

147
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,489
password is supposed to have one long

148
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:09,279
strong password put on every platform

149
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:11,078
that we use and some live long then we

150
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,300
have our choice of password management

151
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:17,139
which kind of ties them the same the

152
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,869
last one I shall drop off say an

153
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:22,269
employee of the company we reused their

154
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:24,399
LinkedIn profile in ten password on

155
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:27,279
their Dropbox which gave access to

156
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:30,249
anyone that had originally like got the

157
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,009
breach and then move along let me have

158
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:35,499
the sis's men for get lap had struck the

159
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:39,759
database of all the people that's also

160
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:41,229
kind of why hey Donna and well it was

161
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,439
like as if he was testing the framework

162
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,878
of search and you can see that in other

163
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,919
words that they've tried everything that

164
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,179
they caught with their backups who not

165
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,008
work at least you know they were

166
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:55,078
transparent about toughness that they

167
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,399
tried and you know so then we have

168
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,429
Amazon really one of these really every

169
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,679
week at one so kind of research it's

170
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:06,128
putting the Prudential ze like

171
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:08,289
information into the booklets and so

172
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,089
from you know owners getting access the

173
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:14,709
privileges were incorrect

174
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:17,769
so allowed people to look in well I have

175
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,809
a video next I will just go back for so

176
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:21,339
so the next video is you're going to

177
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:23,469
look at see that your mana social

178
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,329
engineering himself to get in or if you

179
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,630
want to find out where you can see the

180
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:30,410
guy

181
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,409
[Music]

182
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,720
[Music]

183
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:48,089
okay I'll play the video anyway and you

184
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:58,380
might not hear about Alex linguist and I

185
00:08:48,090 --> 00:09:00,180
don't fancy paying let's go make some

186
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,700
baseball saying that it's gonna get us

187
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,979
jacket you know they get an earpiece now

188
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,070
making some clips peer to peer talkin

189
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,070
[Music]

190
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,799
[Music]

191
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,709
two days welcome true Mike wouldn't show

192
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,709
many ticker any signs of

193
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,589
[Music]

194
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,010
if you're not was server actually going

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,760
to check the tickets as you're going in

196
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,000
what you say the sturdier just suits an

197
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,000
authority lost

198
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,059
[Music]

199
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:06,369
so basically he's social engineer

200
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:09,488
himself in black people think you know I

201
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:12,069
belong here as opposed to humans and

202
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:13,839
that allowed him more posture actually

203
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,919
the vulnerability because you know how

204
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,399
many other people could have got into

205
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,799
the World Cup and you know got free

206
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,039
chicken my heart okay so looking at

207
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,379
these examples just like a quick summary

208
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:29,679
of water about like in my own experience

209
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:30,789
I've learned like trust nobody until

210
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,819
they're proven otherwise

211
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:35,979
and can't always trust who you find on

212
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,389
the internet search and kind of have to

213
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:40,029
be worried about their what they're

214
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,649
looking for them the lack of emails it

215
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,199
was a lack of observation you know like

216
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,579
not thinking before the posts you know

217
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,319
making sure everything on it is right I

218
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,029
mean it's time-consuming to change a

219
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,009
password apparently so keeping your

220
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,889
admin admin is let them suffer you know

221
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,989
a big big loss and then we have the get

222
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,029
lab guy well you know drop in the

223
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,189
database it's not exactly something that

224
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,720
we all want to do and then the security

225
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:04,059
just a lack security in mind

226
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,669
Cuauhtemoc letting the right access for

227
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:08,499
anybody to access these and the last

228
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:11,859
hole at the video of that's genius other

229
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:13,569
well we can all try it sometime and so

230
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:15,220
with that being said I just have a

231
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,809
question for the audience can we afford

232
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:21,069
to our investor and our employees or

233
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:26,309
humans or such like you know is it worth

234
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:26,309
not investing in them and I definitely

235
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,329
[Laughter]

236
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:34,119
definitely think that we do need to

237
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,618
train our humans to give respect and you

238
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,229
know communication is key between

239
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:41,799
employees and employers or between two

240
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:43,779
people you need to be wary of those what

241
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,608
they're saying as well and but training

242
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,589
their employees to have like standards

243
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:49,539
that everyone needs as opposed to like

244
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:51,849
putting that image of them that's you

245
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:54,519
remember you're a risk in the whole

246
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:56,409
picture like not just a picture or if

247
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,419
you list our laptop and it's stuck onto

248
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,669
the laptop like how many people you know

249
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:03,929
that got stole and you have an access to

250
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:06,579
it so that's like an another flaw and

251
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,799
there's like this many ways like we we

252
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,370
all invest in technology as opposed to

253
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,800
as

254
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,870
the Train and like we don't go and get a

255
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,329
job what I've done asserted her you know

256
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,860
Adam to her skills are supposed to or by

257
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,200
the latest laptop and then you know I'll

258
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,850
get the job because I've whatever I said

259
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,290
I'm going off this kind of it's like we

260
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,589
compact herself her but we kind of

261
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,089
partitions and obsessed controversial we

262
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:33,420
can train our human some we can teach

263
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,300
them the right ways of getting there but

264
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:39,160
you know that's that's my end point of

265
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,229
the whole presentation like you know we

266
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,750
can patch itself we're going how much to

267
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,010
human so but that says I'd like to take

268
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:56,860
everyone's listen and if you've any

269
00:12:45,010 --> 00:13:12,910
questions here yeah

270
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:15,640
if there's a few questions or something

271
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,709
like you know like team like team

272
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,740
building and surface but can't depend so

273
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:22,750
on the train lever do our training for

274
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,620
security reasons you should show how

275
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,209
it's doing us you know provide like a

276
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,560
few alternative home

277
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,150
I'm not exactly like I haven't talked

278
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,209
too much on the training side of the

279
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,890
book you know that could be I think we

280
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:40,390
kinda need to all work as a collective

281
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:45,240
group and kind of that's why I'm through

282
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:45,240
with already house yeah

283
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:58,299
[Applause]

284
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,759
[Laughter]

285
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:20,970
and I don't quite understand what the

286
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:22,770
word means but yeah and that's yeah like

287
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,050
I hadn't blocked them straight after

288
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,490
he'd sent me I won't hurt you I left him

289
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,959
like you know lat because he was liking

290
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,970
all my tweets and retweeting and you

291
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,860
know he's getting me fused so I know

292
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,000
that was good for me and then I kind of

293
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,310
got to the point where he's nice to me

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,920
like oh happy birthday or I put it a

295
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,390
suite up about an interesting YouTube

296
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,160
video that I'd watched and I shared or

297
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,300
what everyone and he's I go really like

298
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,490
can you explain more and then he was

299
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,410
tell him that he had books for me with

300
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,300
just a ton of links and he told me to go

301
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,949
look for them and that's kind of like

302
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,469
yeah I'm not gonna click here or else

303
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm not gonna like you know so I kinda

304
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,770
got to the stage after he was like happy

305
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,210
birthday he had enough information I was

306
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:10,319
like yeah that's kind of like you know

307
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:12,990
the end or yeah interesting yeah a good

308
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:22,290
idea where the line is in terms of

309
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:24,510
information to be visible in a job yeah

310
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,040
yeah well I definitely think like being

311
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,170
visible online is got chills because

312
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,969
you're interact I love network miles

313
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,469
getting to know new people so that's my

314
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,200
big thing and you know I didn't want to

315
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,760
decline this guy just cuz you know he

316
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,990
might have been strange whatever I wants

317
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,910
to see what he has to say and then I

318
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,450
kind of got strange so he was like going

319
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,829
or 1/2 K you know and you kind of you

320
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,840
don't I don't draw the line straight

321
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,760
away I kinda you know he never judge a

322
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,500
book by its cover so it kinda gets to

323
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,560
know the person in there you know you

324
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:57,050
know where you stand been kinda yeah I

325
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:00,209
found Susu question so I'm going to

326
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,790
truth yeah

327
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:09,620
I feel like an monster officer you know

328
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,620
yeah that's for any more questions yeah
