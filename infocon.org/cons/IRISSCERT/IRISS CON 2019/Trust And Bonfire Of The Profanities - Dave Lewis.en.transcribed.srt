1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,759
thank you very much and thank you all

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,650
for having me back so today I am going

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,410
to be talking about what I refer to as

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:18,240
the bonfire of the profanities when you

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,240
work in this industry for 25 plus years

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:28,659
I was told I had to do that didn't think

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,830
that was gonna happen idiot all right so

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,470
this is one of those things he is

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,099
actually quite evil because these guys

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,360
turn it on for Sampson step forward

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,550
because I can't hold still

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,839
and there's no remote mic so I kept away

13
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,218
if I start walking around I'm gonna do a

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,280
whole Alex Hutton and I'm not gonna do

15
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,809
that today but I am Dave Lewis and you

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,010
can find me on Twitter as data code

17
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,989
because I've been told I should do that

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,699
at the beginning of a talk so there you

19
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,940
go if you want to have horrible things

20
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,410
happen to you I like to go around the

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,089
world and giving talks at lots of

22
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,218
conferences because I like to share the

23
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,519
stories that yeah okay I'll just keep

24
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:05,349
going so this is my third time here now

25
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,570
the first time I was here I was here to

26
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,740
talk about the attackers and the people

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,699
there trying to break into your systems

28
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,130
that was called barbarians at the

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,930
gateway last year I came back and I was

30
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,270
talking about once they got in the

31
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,049
attackers in the throne room and now

32
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,579
here I am talking about trust

33
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,780
specifically zero trust and if I could

34
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,289
have a show of hands of how many people

35
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,590
are sick and tired of hearing that term

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,320
excellent

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm gonna put it in terms of risk and

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,199
the things that we should have been

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,399
doing for the last 30 years but before I

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,350
get into that the reason I talk about

41
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,450
the profanities is because in this

42
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,579
industry we do tend to swear a lot and

43
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,890
oddly enough apparently is rather

44
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,699
beneficial and even healthy for you to

45
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,329
swear your head off

46
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,579
now because my boss asked me nicely to

47
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,798
not get too dark on to the profanities I

48
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:55,570
have pulled it back a little bit but the

49
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,939
good people at effing Birdseye have

50
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,288
allowed me to have efforts in my

51
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,939
presentation so I'm quite happy about

52
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,490
that because they are Canadian oddly

53
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,679
enough so am I

54
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,090
to cure up you know clear up a couple of

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,560
things I brought this up the first time

56
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,380
I gave a talk here we are not all

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,210
Lumberjacks but some of us do have a

58
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,380
very inherent interest in law and order

59
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,580
and things to that effect hello Mick

60
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,160
I'll tell you what it's all about but

61
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,720
first we'll get right to it

62
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,370
so what's the big idea well we're

63
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,220
talking about zero trust we're talking

64
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,130
about reducing the risk reducing that

65
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,230
surface so the attackers can't get away

66
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,609
with horrible things and that's because

67
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,019
we talked about things like the

68
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,720
perimeter oh I have a firewall

69
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,030
everything is fine I literally sat in a

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,160
meeting after a penetration test where

71
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,080
the CIO looked at me and said it's okay

72
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,370
we have a firewall meanwhile the

73
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,570
penetration testers had a nice thick

74
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,630
report like that they had completely

75
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:53,870
compromised everything the perimeter is

76
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,180
not what it used to be so the that idea

77
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,040
is a very much a deprecated notion and

78
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,080
we have to look at things as anywhere an

79
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,120
access decision is being made because

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,200
the attackers are going to do all sorts

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,030
of horrible things to your network

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,820
they're gonna get in through all manner

83
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,320
of things the one part of my career I

84
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,450
got to do some penetration testing and I

85
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,549
got into systems that I couldn't believe

86
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,018
I got into I was working for the Defense

87
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,060
Department in the United States at one

88
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,580
point as a contractor they didn't seem

89
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,500
to care I was Canadian and in one system

90
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,970
I brought it they brought it out and

91
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,650
they said look we want you to break into

92
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,150
this this was the sponsor for this

93
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,470
program he sat me down in front of a

94
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,510
keyboard I had never seen the system

95
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,220
before and he had some brass from the

96
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,880
military synagogue they try and break

97
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,590
into it oddly enough there is a default

98
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,420
username and password that this

99
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,860
particular branch of the military uses

100
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,179
on all of their systems when they're in

101
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,200
testing well that worked I got in and I

102
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,080
said where would you like me to send you

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,298
Bradley Fighting Vehicle sir

104
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,769
he went closed the laptop took it and

105
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,970
walked there and that was the last I

106
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,340
heard of that particularly conversation

107
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,260
and the thing is is any attack that you

108
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,780
see today is pretty much going to look

109
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,010
like they're supposed to be there if

110
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,019
you're reading all sorts of reports

111
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,640
they're talking about it's at least 200

112
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,170
days in many cases before you even

113
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,910
notice that attacker is in your network

114
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,268
you know reports like Pokemon and things

115
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,609
like that

116
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,050
and as you're going through you have to

117
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,810
actually take away what is the

118
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,430
rationale here rationale if your system

119
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,040
is attacked even if they're in there for

120
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,320
an hour think of the damage they can do

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,300
to your network so you have to make sure

122
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,610
that you're managing the holes in your

123
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,680
network there are all sorts of them

124
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,540
coming in you have VPN email Remote

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,090
Desktop Protocol which we heard about

126
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,500
earlier today and oddly enough duo comm

127
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,039
um we can fix that

128
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,220
DNS oh my god I managed they split

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,210
horizon DNS for a company back in 2006

130
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,090
ish Wow it is so easy for things to go

131
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,430
terribly terribly wrong but we also have

132
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,840
to consider web traffic you have all

133
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,670
this web browser going in and out of

134
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,619
your network and you have to look at it

135
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,060
it's like what are we doing to make sure

136
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,640
that we're taking care of that

137
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,050
low-hanging fruit because the attackers

138
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,180
are going to go after that they don't

139
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,340
have to burn a zero-day to get into your

140
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,950
network if you have a default username

141
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,570
and password we heard about earlier when

142
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,130
Emma was giving her talk about the

143
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,830
administrative credentials on that

144
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,060
particular system where was a Minutemen

145
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,770
oddly enough it was actually not just

146
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,780
one country it was actually roughly

147
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,700
about 27 countries 26 countries sorry

148
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,989
where that portal was available where

149
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,520
you could to get the exact same data

150
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,040
that the attackers apparently got

151
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,710
through the website this is the kind of

152
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,390
thing that leads me to profanity because

153
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,430
when you have the attackers are able to

154
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,500
get into your systems with very very

155
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,780
simple things that we should have been

156
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,330
able to fix this drives me absolutely

157
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,270
the distraction and I tend to break a

158
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,010
lot of walls thankfully I have what I

159
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,599
refer to as the Lewis skull which you

160
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,120
know my wife's not too happy about that

161
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,310
because my kids have it as well this is

162
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,620
exactly how I tend to react the

163
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,919
perimeter is not what we used to think

164
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,240
of it us there's all sorts of assets

165
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,740
that we have to take into account we

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,220
have SAS based applications that we're

167
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,330
dealing with

168
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,980
we have VPNs that designed to marshal

169
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,960
access into your network but oddly

170
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,490
enough you can then go out of the

171
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,900
network again and into the cloud and see

172
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,210
all the websites that oh yes the

173
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,039
attacker can call you back in again so

174
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,340
these are sort of things where VPN well

175
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,990
intentioned is

176
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,770
part of the puzzle we have to look at

177
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,940
this as a layered approach nap man this

178
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,729
drove me crazy when this first started

179
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,500
coming out but the idea here is very

180
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,349
simple you were able to you know marshal

181
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,889
access to the network I worked at the

182
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,500
bank back in the 90s where they were

183
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,830
doing it by children port filtering on

184
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,139
the MAC addresses for the entire Bank

185
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,729
55,000 employees manually setting the

186
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,710
MAC addresses for this entire company

187
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,139
let's just say that nack actually was a

188
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,580
breath of fresh air but it didn't stop

189
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,990
you from taking the system home and

190
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,240
attaching the internet and downloading

191
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
all sorts of wonderful things which I

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,110
have had to live through in a couple of

193
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,909
organizations you have to address the

194
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,860
risk what is the risk in your

195
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,940
environment what are you trying to fix

196
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,310
hello come on in all right we have to

197
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,320
look at it as reducing risk always about

198
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,580
that because otherwise we're getting

199
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,930
lost in the minutiae we're getting

200
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,800
wrapped around the axle on things that

201
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,120
just don't matter back in 2003 the

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,880
Jericho forum was talking about deep

203
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,620
perimeter ization this was basically the

204
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,200
forerunner to what we now know is zero

205
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,729
trust in 2010 john kinder vog what he

206
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,300
was at Forrester came up with this term

207
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,680
this term is now him much maligned at

208
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,539
this point but it gets the point across

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,580
it actually got people to pay attention

210
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,780
and when you're talking about zero trust

211
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,969
you're talking about network razón

212
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,179
segmentation user management all of

213
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,620
these different components that we

214
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,479
should have been taken care of all one

215
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,070
this is getting back to the core

216
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,469
fundamentals this is returning to zero

217
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,030
making sure that we go back and start

218
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,450
addressing the things that we have

219
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:57,359
neglected over time so what does zero

220
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,740
Trust really mean and unfortunately

221
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,060
there are so many vendors out there that

222
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,830
are saying all sorts of different things

223
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,400
like oh you can be zero trust certified

224
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,050
no that's not a thing if you buy this

225
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,560
box and plug it in you're gonna be zero

226
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,400
trust ready no none of that works you

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,289
want to make sure that you're

228
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,539
understanding what the messaging is zero

229
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,820
trust is a game of increments you are

230
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,960
trying to make your environment

231
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,530
incrementally more secure as you go

232
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,710
along

233
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,059
it takes some organizations years in

234
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,008
order to accomplish this and I'll talk

235
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,199
about it a little bit

236
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,589
oh you want to make sure that your

237
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,180
messaging is on point because when you

238
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:36,078
think you're saying something that makes

239
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,638
sense this is actually a campaign of the

240
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:40,159
South Dakota in the United States and a

241
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:44,810
couple days ago it's a very serious

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,250
issue but damn you want to make sure

243
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,170
that when you are getting your messaging

244
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,750
across you don't come across looking

245
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,339
like a nincompoop because all of a

246
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,839
sudden the entire Internet is there and

247
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,920
they're going to pop up and say hey how

248
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,959
you doing zero trust really is about

249
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,089
everything is on fire that's the easiest

250
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:04,689
way for me to articulate it you want to

251
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:06,500
look at it as everything is open season

252
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,589
now I've said this before but I'll

253
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,360
reiterate this we're back in around 2003

254
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,310
or reductions closer to 2004

255
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,170
I had proposed making all the laptops

256
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,069
and desktops in our ization Bastion host

257
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,079
and then exposing the internet they

258
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:23,029
didn't like that at my company but I

259
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,560
didn't realize how far ahead of the game

260
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,180
I was it was just more of a case of I

261
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,709
got tired of managing all of these zones

262
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,910
that we had implemented and I thought

263
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,930
there's got to be a better way to do

264
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,519
this you've got to make sure that you're

265
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,069
extending out how you're going to look

266
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,160
at security because that original

267
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,660
traditional perimeter is gone and every

268
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,510
organisation no matter how you slice it

269
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,310
it just doesn't exist anymore and the

270
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,529
more that I hear people saying it's okay

271
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,949
it's inside the firewall the more I tend

272
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,389
to lose my mind we want to make sure

273
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:55,399
that we are addressing things in a

274
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,139
correct fashion we like to think of

275
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,699
ourselves as environmentally friendly I

276
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,720
brought this one up before I'll bring it

277
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:04,250
up again don't reuse your passwords the

278
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,170
attackers know that we did we have

279
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,230
opposable thumbs but we really aren't

280
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,020
that far beyond you ferrets

281
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,580
and we will make sure that we're doing a

282
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,870
better job you have password managers

283
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,170
you have multi-factor authentication you

284
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,550
have biometrics you have options because

285
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,740
the static usernames and passwords are

286
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,689
no good if you have a key with your

287
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,980
house information or a picture of your

288
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,480
family or something like that you drop

289
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,730
it on the sidewalk when you're off to

290
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,510
work an attacker can come along go oh

291
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,160
free house go open the door doesn't mean

292
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,870
that's the right person coming through

293
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,130
the door

294
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,610
static usernames and passwords have

295
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,350
really failed us and data breaches are

296
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,750
going to keep happening as we go along

297
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,960
because we need to address this in a

298
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,210
more cohesive fashion when we look at

299
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,800
things like various reports out there

300
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,680
the Verizon Dvir

301
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,449
IDC research things like that 81% of

302
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,250
Reach's involved weak credentials in one

303
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,510
report and 70% involve compromised

304
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:05,420
devices right we want to make sure that

305
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,580
we are doing a better job now every time

306
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,560
I give a talk I talk about the types of

307
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,440
data breaches information is beautiful

308
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,750
net is like eye candy for me this

309
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,360
particular slide here from four years

310
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:22,670
ago this with data breaches four years

311
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,500
ago then two years ago then information

312
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,610
beautiful that okay we have to read jyg

313
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,320
how we're doing our presentation because

314
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,640
nobody can read that mess so they did

315
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:38,960
this that was six months ago this was

316
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:43,430
yesterday we can do better or I'll see

317
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,760
you in Hell at this point any a little

318
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,760
bit of coffee

319
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,720
[Applause]

320
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,888
so when it was lying here last year one

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,940
of the things that I brought up was

322
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,220
talking about the flaming sword of

323
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,680
justice this is the old way of doing

324
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,370
security where you would be how do I get

325
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,310
to know we have a new project no we want

326
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,290
to open this particular port yet no

327
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,000
doing nothing to enable the business as

328
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,310
security practitioners we have to be

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,449
there to champion the business and help

330
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,250
them get things done safely and securely

331
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:22,380
we need to make sure that we are part of

332
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,880
the solution and not being relegated to

333
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,790
oh they're just a cost center we don't

334
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,810
want to talk to them anymore you know

335
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,459
you've had that conversation before when

336
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,380
you're looking at where your users are

337
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:37,079
it shouldn't matter where they're

338
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,839
physically located I have been a remote

339
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,079
worker for over 15 years now

340
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:44,160
it's a bloody fantastic thing at times

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,050
but I should be able to have the same

342
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,680
experience in a coffee shop in Toronto

343
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,589
that I have in an office in Dublin there

344
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,939
really shouldn't be any variation I mean

345
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:55,560
that's why zero trust is a good thing

346
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,290
because you help build that framework so

347
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,899
that the employees can operate within it

348
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:05,610
in a safe and secure manner so there are

349
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,699
some great examples out there Google ran

350
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,019
out their version called beyond court

351
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:13,500
now this is how they got to their

352
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:17,100
version of zero trust this took them

353
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,500
seven years to implement so don't lose

354
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,760
heart if you are going down this path if

355
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,550
this is something you want to entertain

356
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,560
I'm all for it I definitely am in favor

357
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,120
of it but it took them seven years so

358
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,949
you can set that as a benchmark they had

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,870
an entire dedicated team to get to that

360
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,010
point

361
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,410
intel has this is their version of

362
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,480
beyond the edge but this is good because

363
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,189
both of these companies are suing in a

364
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,260
distance alike so Cisco and others how

365
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,839
to get to a zero trust model by eating

366
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,689
their own dog food so why is this

367
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,670
awesome the simplest way is multi-factor

368
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,529
authentication is the gateway drug I

369
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,349
always like to look at that as the

370
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,730
gateway drug brother to zero trust so if

371
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,949
an attacker is able to get your device

372
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,209
they have to know your username your

373
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:58,979
password or a bit because

374
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:02,128
access to it but then they need the

375
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,509
other factor and they don't have that so

376
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:05,189
you're there you're limiting the ability

377
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,839
of the attacker to cause a storm trouble

378
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:08,040
if they breach the database and they're

379
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,139
able to dump all the information to have

380
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,610
all your usernames and passwords what

381
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,990
they like to do is take them and run

382
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,540
them against various other sites and see

383
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,790
if they can gain access and if they can

384
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,349
then they will just keep iterating until

385
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,879
they have all the access that they can

386
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,139
get but if they have multi-factor

387
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,119
authentication enabled on all these

388
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,490
accounts and I'm not talking about SMS

389
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:28,319
although that's not so bad it's much

390
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,660
maligned but still better than a kick in

391
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:32,459
the head you want to make sure that

392
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,230
you're limiting the attackers ability to

393
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:39,599
do what they need to do you need more

394
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,939
than a password you need to be able to

395
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,379
check the hygiena device that attaching

396
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,849
to your network if you're doing bring

397
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,499
your own device that's fantastic go for

398
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,999
it fill your boots but make sure you are

399
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:49,829
setting out in such a way that you have

400
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:52,170
a risk profile that is associated with

401
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,459
your organization what is the risk if

402
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,920
somebody comes in with their own laptop

403
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,508
if you're using zero trust as an

404
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,248
approach you're using as a going through

405
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,619
a gateway the Gateway says ok you have

406
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:02,699
to be this level of patching this level

407
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,619
of security you have to have a screen

408
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:08,549
saver on all these sort of things to

409
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:11,339
make sure that you are a certain level

410
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:13,079
to ride that particular ride so when

411
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,549
they get into the network then you know

412
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,679
that you have a certain level of trust

413
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:23,069
that it's going to be ok the best thing

414
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,420
is you can build your own you want to

415
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,429
make sure that you're focusing on three

416
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,490
key piece we all love our triangles so

417
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,860
users devices and applications I always

418
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,149
love talking about this one user

419
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,160
database review that we did at the

420
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,689
company I was working at we went through

421
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,189
and there were 10 users in this

422
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:41,040
particular database that has super users

423
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:45,029
access that did not work at a company

424
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,610
anymore two of them had been gone for

425
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:50,730
more than five years one of them died

426
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,339
five years earlier and that particular

427
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,470
person's account was used two years ago

428
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,990
at that point in time during the review

429
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,689
so I'll agree we have ghosts that can

430
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,519
use quarter keepers this was a real

431
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:03,279
problem because we had no way to track

432
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,319
down who is you

433
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,300
that particular information this same

434
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:09,370
organization also had default usernames

435
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,498
and passwords on every laptop and

436
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,540
desktop in the organization that was the

437
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:15,879
worst kept secret you had ever seen in

438
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,410
your life I could call the helpdesk and

439
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,240
I say oh what's the admin password

440
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,879
credentials for the local on this

441
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,829
particular right oh here you go no

442
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,149
authentication no checking who I was but

443
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:27,758
they thought oh well you are called to

444
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:30,160
help this so you must be one of us we

445
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,660
got that fixed when you're looking at

446
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,980
getting to a zero trust above

447
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,959
organisation you want to look at

448
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,160
establishing the user trust you want to

449
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,449
know who the users are in your

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,620
organization you want to know the

451
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,779
service accounts you want to know all

452
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,519
these different components you want to

453
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,319
be able to gain visibility into the

454
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,540
devices that are attaching to your

455
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,699
network what kind of activity are these

456
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,998
devices doing are they making random

457
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:54,399
calls out to a server in China Shanghai

458
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:56,050
and then moving a database from your

459
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,110
network to their network because it's a

460
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,189
backup protocol yeah that actually

461
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,720
happened at one company I was working at

462
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:04,720
Lee oh yeah no it's been there for eight

463
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:11,260
years I'm like we don't have an office

464
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,490
in Shanghai oh that was awkward you want

465
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,599
to ensure the trustworthiness of the

466
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,280
device is somebody coming in with

467
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,889
Windows ME are they using yellow dog

468
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,049
linux from back in the day you want to

469
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,520
make sure that you're not accidentally

470
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:23,770
introducing problems into your

471
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,520
environment you want to be able to

472
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,510
enforce adaptive policies if you have

473
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,639
finance people that are only allowed to

474
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,140
have sa P whatever it happens to be but

475
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,940
they're not supposed to get into github

476
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,919
you want to make sure that that policy

477
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,960
doesn't permit them to do that because

478
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,110
why why would you want access like that

479
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,340
I once worked at a financial corporation

480
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,350
where I was able to access the mainframe

481
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,908
men I felt bad because I was playing

482
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,649
around with it trying to get in I went

483
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:51,149
and turned myself in they said we didn't

484
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:53,350
even know this this is not good

485
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:55,600
as you build through these stages

486
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,360
whatever is under you use whatever

487
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,100
solution you use to get to that zero

488
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,389
trust iteration it doesn't matter the

489
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,730
members you want to have it with the

490
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,130
purpose you want to have it as a goal as

491
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,960
something to a stripe life force because

492
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,210
you have this as your ecosystem that you

493
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,059
have to deal with identity access

494
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,049

endpoint management detection or

496

response

497
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,840
you want to make sure that you don't

498
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,520
have a really nice shiny detection or

499
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,159
response mechanism that nobody's looking

500
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,650
at we've all heard about a particular

501
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,410
company in the US where they had spent

502
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,550
all the money they had all the toys but

503
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:31,490
there's so many alerts they just stopped

504
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,980
paying attention because bad things are

505
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,330
gonna continue to happen this is back in

506
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,610
the spring I believe it was yet back in

507
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,919
May blue keep remote desktop exploits

508
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,719
we're gonna keep on coming and they have

509
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,130
them keeping I'm not coming we've seen

510
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,750
just recently there was a discussion

511
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,640
about a worm apparently that was going

512
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,100
around as well I'm sure that's not a

513
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,050
problem so back in May I ran on showed

514
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,750
and I said I'll have a look who do we

515
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,840
have there Oh 2.3 million results and

516
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,600
they're rounding up 2.4 ok so I ran this

517
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,760
yesterday

518
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,469
now 3.8 million devices are running

519
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,110
remote desktop and I'm sure they're all

520
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,170
perfectly secure 3.8 million but wait

521
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,330
self-signed certificate first result I

522
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,340
went through there oh my goodness there

523
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,899
is a certain I am there's a certain

524
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,720
provider in China that really should

525
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,820
have a look at their stuff but it's not

526
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,660
only there we have to look here in

527
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:26,689
dublin blue key is unpatched on that

528
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,540
many systems in ireland right now to a

529
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,640
lesser extent we have eternal blue is

530
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,629
vulnerable on 30 systems in ireland

531
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,160
today there are challenges that we have

532
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,440
to address when we're looking at zero

533
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,180
trust one of them is selling it into

534
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,800
management because they see that nigga

535
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,840
zero trust that sounds so negative all

536
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,180
right what's called trusted access let's

537
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,320
call it risk reduction whatever works to

538
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,630
get the job done

539
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,689
because somewhere along the lines we've

540
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,790
lost our trail of dealing with the core

541
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,560
fundamentals of dealing with making sure

542
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,210
we have log management making sure that

543
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,919
we are looking through at the users

544
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,570
network zone segmentation all of these

545
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,110
different core components that help

546
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,159
build a secure enterprise

547
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,020
you want to be able to make sure that

548
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,360
your policies make sense in a zero trust

549
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,010
environment one organisation I worked

550
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,419
for we went through all the policies and

551
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,430
this was not a zero trust endeavor back

552
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,710
then that's it back in 2008 I think it

553
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,440
was one of the policies had nothing to

554
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,600
do with anything we couldn't understand

555
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,370
said we had to be certified in a

556
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,840
particular certification that made no

557
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,239
sense no one had ever heard of it

558
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,449
I went searching through I couldn't find

559
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,430
anything online until finally the person

560
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,080
who had implemented it years earlier was

561
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,050
still the company and fast up as to what

562
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,639
it was one night she was trying to get

563
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,680
this all done yeah there's one policy

564
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,400
left to do so she did a copy of paste on

565
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,630
a swimming certification and it searched

566
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,960
her place on certain words to make it

567
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:54,220
look like it was a security thing Wow

568
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,510
when you're looking at a zero trust

569
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,280
approach you want to look at it as a

570
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,200
game of increments you want to go

571
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,760
through a little bit by little bit look

572
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,590
at multi-factor authentication look at

573
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,470
blocking on your devices looking at all

574
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,330
these things that may seem overly simple

575
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,010
but these are core fundamentals it's

576
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,020
somewhere along the lines we got lost

577
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,430
and started chasing after it will shine

578
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,680
II look at that we got a zero day I

579
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,030
don't give a damn about a zero day any

580
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,700
more when I was looking at databases

581
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:22,060
that haven't had their quarterly patch

582
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,020
cycle for three years you know that

583
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,899
happens because I've been in

584
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,910
environments where it is you want to

585
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,940
look at user trust you want to make sure

586
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,990
your asset I'm a big fan of repetition

587
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,960
establishing user trust who are the

588
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,680
users in your environment you want to go

589
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,210
through and discover what is on the wire

590
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,470
one organization I was in we went and

591
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,420
then we did a scan of everything and

592
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,980
they said okay you have 30,000 plus

593
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,740
devices on the network we scanned it

594
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,040
there was 45,000 they couldn't tell us

595
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,180
why there was all the other devices you

596
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,460
want to make sure you're going through

597
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,960
and see what devices are trusted what

598
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,840
devices are supposed to be on your

599
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,930
network what are the untrusted ones do

600
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,659
you even know in that environment we had

601
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:08,680
no idea we found a lot of devices that

602
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:12,280
had not been patched in years and they

603
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,600
were in extremely bad shape so once you

604
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,220
find these devices you want to bring

605
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,629
them up to a level that is what you

606
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,670
consider trustworthy in your environment

607
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,680
and this all goes back to that risk

608
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,760
discussion in your environment what

609
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,020
makes the most sense what are you

610
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,100
worried about are you making teddy bears

611
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,100
breathing of centrifuges

612
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,150
you want to make sure that you're not

613
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,350
reusing usernames and passwords this is

614
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,340
going to bite you in the ass every

615
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,370
single time

616
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,740
and yes this causes me to swear

617
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,299
profusely Cruz you want make sure you're

618
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,440
enforcing these policies you want to

619
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,730
make sure that you do not have a

620
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,710
director of communications he's coming

621
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,570
to you saying I need wide open access

622
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,100
and websites to attach to everything on

623
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,040
the internet because I need to do

624
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,209
research and then 48 hours later you're

625
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,830
having to take a laptop away from at

626
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,440
home because it's little from the porn

627
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:00,159
site with all sorts of malware I'm like

628
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,309
good job dude yeah that was a fun

629
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,799
conversation when you're looking at your

630
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:08,049
policies what is making sense in your

631
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:09,490
environment are you doing geo blocks

632
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:12,400
that you have to make sure I don't want

633
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,780
country X accessing my network if you're

634
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,000
doing that that's fine but you have to

635
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,190
understand that is only a small

636
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,620
impedance I used to do bulk on filters

637
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,390
on routers for the US Navy and when we

638
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,969
put those in it not as a serving

639
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,890
personal issues I put these bug on lists

640
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,179
on routers so that various countries

641
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,350
couldn't attach the network but they'd

642
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:31,270
be just route through other third

643
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,610
countries so let's just slow them down

644
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,720
for a little bit you want to make sure

645
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,668
that you're looking at what are the

646
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,049
grace periods like if you're having

647
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,370
somebody that's logging into the network

648
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,200
and that has been on the road for a very

649
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,389
long time and you haven't passed your

650
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,650
system to current and you want to make

651
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,730
sure you give them a chance to fix it

652
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,020
before you're bumped off the network

653
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,530
because yeah that's never happened to me

654
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,240
more than once you want to look at the

655
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,918
applications in your environment and

656
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,140
make sure you're marshalling access to

657
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,880
them do you want some nitwit that's

658
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,480
sitting in a Tim Hortons in Toronto

659
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,350
Canada

660
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,360
accessing your email no probably want to

661
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,928
make sure they're just from your company

662
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,990
so that you have them arseling through a

663
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:14,740
secure gateway because static usernames

664
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,419
and passwords are flawed back in 1962

665
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,820
there was a high powered computing

666
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:20,320
system called cts s each student here

667
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,270
had four hours per week where they could

668
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,409
do their tremens some of the other

669
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,690
students figured out they could actually

670
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,220
steal time by guessing the by

671
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,919
incrementing through the user account

672
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,530
IDs so the professor at the time put on

673
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,059
a password controller as near as we can

674
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,379
figure out he that was the first time

675
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:35,520
that this was ever implemented this was

676
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,370
a

677
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,020
reactionary measure IBM came out with

678
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,639
the system the same year that had

679
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,950
passwords but even they say that this

680
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,050
particular system beat them to the punch

681
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,630
this was a reactionary measure in 1962

682
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:53,430
that we're still dealing with in 2019 it

683
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:56,340
is not secure it is buying US time not a

684
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,720
lot and it shows that things like there

685
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,240
are reports out there Google's own data

686
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,160
went through and they found that using

687
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,200
multi-factor authentication reduced the

688
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,730
number of hacks why because if the

689
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:10,140
attacker can't get in there nope screw

690
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:14,550
this I'm on to the next item what can

691
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:17,700
you do big fan of repetition establish

692
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,419
trust in your users track the user

693
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,180
devices and their trustworthiness

694
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,620
enforce risk-based security standards

695
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,320
don't just go oh my god I read about it

696
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:31,679
in the news when they let me write

697
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,270
articles you should be concerned enable

698
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,390
secure access for the applications one

699
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,800
at a time don't do everything at once

700
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,240
because if you go oh and I just click it

701
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,460
all and go alive today guess what that

702
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,550
never works especially when you do it on

703
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:50,280
a Friday at 4:00 p.m. I've lived through

704
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:52,290

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,120
absolute honor for me to be back here

724
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:48,940
question oddly enough and I'm not going

725
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,530
to go vendor e on you we actually at our

726
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,390
company we are actually talking with a

727
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,250
lot of the EHR providers and things like

728
00:26:52,390 --> 00:27:37,180
that about doing this and we do have a

729
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:37,990
lot of healthcare customers all right so

730
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,550
what you're talking about is about

731
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,870
organizations particularly healthcare

732
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,159
organization consolidating all their

733
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,139
information and single repositories

734
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,000
unfortunately that is not specific to

735
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,740
just healthcare we see that in a lot of

736
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,570
organizations and making sure that you

737
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,790
are managing that access in a sane

738
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:55,629
risk-based approach is really

739
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:59,970
fundamental yeah any other questions

740
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:02,080
before fines nope

741
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,080
