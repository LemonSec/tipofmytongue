1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,280
hello how are we this is going to be

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,960
completely different to what you feel

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,780
lessons to do today no idea

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,090
I do give talks outside the industry

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,369
surprisingly it does exist a world

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,080
outside and a lot of the time I'm asked

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,509
to talk about some of the skills I use

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,220
in the job and I thought I'd have a look

9
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:25,919
today is that what I needed to do first

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,198
of all as an experiment so I'm going to

11
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:31,289
talk a bit about deception and deception

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,360
detection I am I'm gonna give you some

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,070
stats later about how the general public

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,220
and a couple of different professions

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,130
are we're detecting lies but I wanted to

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,570
see how a security audience would do so

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,480
I've got three people are gonna help me

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,770
out I am and I'm just gonna need to do

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,660
something for a minute so in my hands

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,580
I've got three pieces of paper identical

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:10,320
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:01:11,939
three of my volunteers want you to do

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,908
for the three people you are piece of

24
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,158
paper on to the pieces of paper a blank

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,520
and one of them's got the word lie on it

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,369
in a minute I'm gonna ask you to tell me

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,149
more and just give the audience two

28
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,549
sentences okay if you've got nothing on

29
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,859
the piece of paper just tell the truth

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,569
and if you've got the word lie just like

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,759
to make something off all I want you to

32
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,280
do is very briefly tell the audience

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,950
about a memorable meal okay

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,369
so nothing that anyone was with you at I

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,780
am just very briefly you know what it

36
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,209
was why it was memorable could have been

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,299
good could have been bad anything like

38
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:53,850
that okay and what I want you guys to do

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,960
is see if you can spot the liar all

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:01,479
right so do that in a minute

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,030
so obviously as a social engineer a lot

42
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,380
of the time I'm actually introduced as a

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,259
professional liar

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,030
we're so a bit of an insult I'm and I

45
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,160
suppose it's kind of true you know if

46
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,170
you define deception as the act of

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,150
hiding the truth illegal methods used to

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,260
get to something or to make people

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,019
believe that something is true and it

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,010
isn't social engineers are professional

51
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:27,849
liars and obviously we use that and

52
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:30,069
various ways throughout the job so

53
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,589
whether it's physical infiltration

54
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:36,010
whether it's writing spear phishing

55
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,769
emails I am any kind of contact involves

56
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,739
deception but also there's another part

57
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,239
of the job where Lane and outs of spot

58
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,810
deception is quite useful on the

59
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,060
investigative side on the defense side

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,400
so I learned a I did some extensive

61
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,370
studying on credibility interception a

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,280
few years ago and I've used it in the

63
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,709
job for various things now if I'd

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,590
mentioned today inside a threat a few

65
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:05,470
times I said deception worth is involved

66
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,200
with that we put emails and awesome

67
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,299
investigations for clients so for all

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,760
clients criminal clients and also a lot

69
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:14,709
of high net worth individuals they were

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,239
looking at their teams and looking to

71
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,049
see if we can spot if you like the

72
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,739
insider threat and it's also applied in

73
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,569
what we call we now have to call

74
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,269
intensive interview we used to call

75
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:30,700
interrogation we're not allowed to call

76
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,170
it interrogation anymore I'm really not

77
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,630
supposed to call intensive you're

78
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,339
supposed to call invest it's it but the

79
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,859
reason this matters is because the

80
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,230
insider threat is on the increase I am

81
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,880
or at least the report of it is and when

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,340
you think you've identified insider

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,200
threat and you want to go through what

84
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,660
they've written and perhaps do

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,608
face-to-face interviews if some of the

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,130
stuff I'm gonna tell you stay might help

87
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,540
you spot as some deception now before I

88
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,870
give any further on that I just wanna

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,459
let you know this is a massive area I am

90
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,329
it takes years to get even close to

91
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,620
perfecting it

92
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,540
and I've seen half an hour I'm gonna

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,850
give you a few pointers but I still

94
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,040
think in this community

95
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,790
useful aim and that's why I put out

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,739
there so if I could have my three

97
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,050
memorable meals don't be insulted by the

98
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,269
potatoes I did say to you if we could

99
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:21,030
have Tom and Eve and say oh come on just

100
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,469
tell us about your meal now please don't

101
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,119
be insulted by the potatoes I set a

102
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,950
memorable meal they said Island you've

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,320
got to put spuds oh and I thought you

104
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,030
wouldn't like that but then they say so

105
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,650
yeah just so why don't you just observe

106
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,900
make it making mind or put don't say

107
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,159
anything to anyone raise your hands or

108
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,919
anything and we'll do it again at the

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,340
end Tom let me watch you though

110
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,150
my memorable my oatmeal was in New York

111
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,820
City

112
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,950
Peter Lugar's it was with two friends

113
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,580
who are 40 are no longer with us

114
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,310
and I heard about this restaurant

115
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,320
because I watched a TV show about it

116
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,960
where they hung the meat downstairs and

117
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,659
when I asked if I could go and see the

118
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,239
place downstairs the waiter kind of

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,370
threateningly said to me we can't let

120
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,970
you down there because you might slip

121
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:18,990
and hurt yourself which felt more like a

122
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:20,730
threat than a warning my most memorable

123
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,890
meal was when I was also in New York

124
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,110
City at lathe Hall as a steak house

125
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,090
there and it was a fantastic meal and

126
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,010
Colin Farrell ball people was at the

127
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,429
next table and that was it was a pretty

128
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,430
interesting

129
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,919
[Laughter]

130
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,420
my memorable meal was at the witchery in

131
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,100
Edinburgh with my mum who's no longer

132
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,889
with us and it was amazing we were

133
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:47,020
watching the fireworks on and New Year's

134
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,020
Eve out of the window so that was mine

135
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:58,430
[Music]

136
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,830
in your hair anyone else see if you can

137
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,600
pick out which one you think was the one

138
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,740
that was telling a lie and then what

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,970
we'll do is we'll ask you to play it one

140
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,770
more time before the end after I've

141
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,660
given you some tips and then we'll have

142
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,310
a show of hands of who we think but just

143
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,110
to put my money where my mouth is

144
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,630
I'm gonna write down on here who I think

145
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:29,900
it is and we'll see if I go straight as

146
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:31,400
well okay okay so find out whether

147
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,669
someone's tell the truth to tell a lie

148
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,039
has been the holy grail for humanity for

149
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,729
ever okay we've got lots of different

150
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,600
lie detection methods back in ancient

151
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,510
China

152
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,930
you see he's of a spoon I'm put it in

153
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,990
someone's mouth and if it stuck to your

154
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,190
tongue you were lying because they were

155
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,320
awakened on the see that your mouth goes

156
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,610
dry when you lie which is sometimes Joss

157
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,370
and I'll show you why in a minute

158
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,090
we've got the bucket della verita in

159
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,890
Rome which was someone who's accused of

160
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,590
a lie let's just put the hand in the

161
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,750
mouth and now if they were telling the

162
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,570
truth the hand came out intact if they

163
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,030
were lying they'd lose some fingers it

164
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,039
probably doesn't take a genius to work

165
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,159
out that there was someone standing

166
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,530
behind the Baka Televisa with a big

167
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,440
sword you see light attached as a

168
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,200
political thing a lot of the time a lot

169
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,600
of the basis collection methods are

170
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,590
political the data sacks tend to be

171
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,480
biased

172
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,840
so for example a lot of the technology

173
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,910
only focuses on at white males even

174
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,450
though it's used to help convince people

175
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,430
of color and other things you might be

176
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,400
familiar with docking stores hopefully

177
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,900
you're not and then you know the tack

178
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,400
goes on we've got things like tooth

179
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,039
serums you know McMansion polygraphs

180
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,109
polygraphs do not measure credibility or

181
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,660
deception what they measure is

182
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,639
psychophysiological responses so

183
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,650
everything from pupil dilation to

184
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,889
endocrine activity so how much you sweat

185
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,260
a blood pressure that type of thing they

186
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,060
work well because people think that they

187
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,490
work but actually what the measureless

188
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,070
stress responses it's the question in

189
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,040
technique and the convicts or gets

190
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:22,000
people to aim to look guilty and admit

191
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,380
guilt and then we've got things like a

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,540
because I thought I put tack in for you

193
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,050
you see there's even one slide just

194
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,080
wrote technical cloud which is a high

195
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,969
definition thermal camera images

196
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,890
basically the face everyone but what's

197
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,830
so lovely is everyone is exactly the

198
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,218
same under this skin right human face

199
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,890
has 44 muscles and they move in certain

200
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,460
ways when we experience one of the seven

201
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:53,990
major emotions and regardless of your

202
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,480
age gender ethnicity anything else these

203
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,270
are the seven you might need must make

204
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,180
her facial expressions people to keep

205
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,760
trying to describe as a micro facial

206
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,920
expressions but I am the research just

207
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,620
over again shoes that we all do the same

208
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,839
thing I've no more time to talk to you

209
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,860
about that today unfortunately we've

210
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,420
also got brain scan technology because

211
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,670
apparently part of the brain when it

212
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,620
remembers lights off as opposed to part

213
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,630
of the brain and that's never seen

214
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,430
something before lights up just got

215
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,830
implications if people are accused of

216
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,660
say for example of murder and you show

217
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,550
them a picture the scene if they've seen

218
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,469
it before one side of the brain lights

219
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,969
up if they've never seen it the other

220
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,000
side does so in theory it's gonna help

221
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,130
with

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,600
innocent people are Hughes de crimes and

223
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,560
then finally we've got hey I

224
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,520
particularly looking to go into a of

225
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,349
course and the problem with all the

226
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,270
technology is that just tends to be a

227
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,650
lot of false positives and of course

228
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,850
some guilty people get through as well

229
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:56,310
so we're still not there with the

230
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:59,310
technology now we are crap as a species

231
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,020
a detect interception okay and this is

232
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,060
why I'm so interested in this little

233
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,560
experiment that I'm doing the general

234
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,839
public had no basis and chance and

235
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,849
needless law enforcement depending on

236
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,030
what study you look at anything between

237
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,550
49 53 percent intelligence community our

238
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,140
own slightly better but it shouldn't

239
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,750
surprise you to see that maximum

240
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,720
security prisoners are the best people

241
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,010
in the world reason emotion and detect

242
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,840
and weather basically someone is

243
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,830
bluffing and that's because it's

244
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,580
obviously a marshal life-and-death

245
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,170
whether they know that deception

246
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,400
detectors as in people who've done all

247
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,500
the training claimed seventy percent

248
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,939
right now anecdotally it's hard to prove

249
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,160
sometimes because sometimes we never

250
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,690
know the outcome and so what we never do

251
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,550
is say whether someone's telling a lie

252
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,440
or tell the truth we give a balance of

253
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:51,620
credibility so the probability of

254
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,970
credibility is acts so why are we so bad

255
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,790
firstly because you do not want to

256
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,290
believe that people are liars now this

257
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,540
is the security community but we are

258
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,219
paranoid and we don't mind this or a

259
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,810
general public want to believe that

260
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
people they want to come from a good

261
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,849
place they want to believe that people

262
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,760
are honest more than people are

263
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,710
deceptive and there's also some people

264
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,120
will incredibly go today so if you go to

265
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:20,370
the sociopathic psychopathic tendencies

266
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,589
and the lies we hast very well so

267
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,690
whether we can spot someone lyin depends

268
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,550
on the person who's doing the lie the

269
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,890
lie itself and the consequence is the

270
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,479
enormity of it and the life spotter

271
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:34,170
right so some people are bastards

272
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,270
detecting it for other reasons but we

273
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,880
also like to think that good-looking

274
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:42,750
people are people who look the part and

275
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,670
sound the past a good we are we make our

276
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,410
mind off as a species very quickly on

277
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,150
whether someone's credible or not and

278
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,130
that can cause us problems because we

279
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,050
all now

280
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,070
that what people think we are and what

281
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,420
we actually are sometimes not the same

282
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,940
we've also got things like biases

283
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,290
kicking in if you've decided something

284
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,820
is right and particular if you've

285
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,310
declared it in public it's very hard

286
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,370
psychologically to go back on that

287
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:09,979
there's also an awful lot of frankly

288
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,380
rubbish and pseudoscience about lie

289
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,160
detection particularly the eye movement

290
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,220
thing and which is from the discredited

291
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,589
pseudoscience my opinion only of NLP and

292
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,110
the eye movements is not credible as

293
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:28,220
being disproved by a professor Wiseman

294
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:30,290
and others over the years so well

295
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,870
rubbish at it and we shouldn't be

296
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,630
because when we lie we give off lots of

297
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,770
signals what we have to do so tell a lie

298
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,620
the first thing you have to do is

299
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,819
conceal the truth right you have to

300
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,920
remember the thing that you're trying

301
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,320
not to talk about make sure that you can

302
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,510
seal it and the other thing you have to

303
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,290
do is fabricate a new tooth preferably

304
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:53,270
one that is credible and and you need to

305
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,880
forget the old one and wait with the new

306
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,670
one you also have to try and look

307
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,710
innocent and not arouse suspicion this

308
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,540
genius broke into a house stole a phone

309
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,520
took a photograph of himself with the

310
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,510
phone in the house and then sent it to

311
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,980
the lady's wife means in car services

312
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,260
and you also have to cover your

313
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,500
deceptive actions with something else

314
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,430
and try and give a story the covers of

315
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,680
what happened

316
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,180
and also you have to remember the

317
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,530
details of a new story

318
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,479
I'm preferably not one that anyone else

319
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,250
can deny and so what happens is your

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,380
brain student a lot of heavy liftin it

321
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:33,080
kind of overloads we call cognitive

322
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,300
overload and I was just but we say to

323
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,590
you for a technical analogy but what

324
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:42,969
it's like is this so you live around of

325
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,970
course my kids ever technical flight

326
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,529
why I used to describe it to

327
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,300
non-technical people we perhaps wouldn't

328
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,459
judge me so bad if I get this wrong is

329
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,540
it's just like having every program open

330
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,219
on that on your computers like

331
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,959
everything's going on your brains doing

332
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,769
the heavy lifting and what happens is

333
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,079
that you leak

334
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,610
you start to leak information now we

335
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,739
don't have time today for me to give you

336
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,589
too many details but I went across the

337
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,320
said entrapped system so basically when

338
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,630
I'm interviewing and someone who is a

339
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,670
person of interest another inquiry we

340
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,439
look at different things we look at

341
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,029
these seven things and today I'm just

342
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,610
gonna focus on a couple of them for you

343
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,860
okay the man that I do not want to split

344
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,050
up any marriages cause any problems in

345
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,670
work just me telling you this does not

346
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,839
mean you can conclude they're just some

347
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,310
tips okay very minutes the first thing

348
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,220
you need to understand is that a myths

349
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:36,319
about body language okay and we wouldn't

350
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,829
even refer to as body language in the

351
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,209
trades you defense don't variables and

352
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:42,739
there's so much about that I really even

353
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,939
can't even begin to address us today but

354
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,890
basically Jess just can't be judged

355
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,180
because they're nuanced in the same way

356
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,800
that we have language within our

357
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,170
community that is body language within

358
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,490
communities even within families so you

359
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,740
can't really judge that's what I'm going

360
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,959
to show you it's what human beings do

361
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,750
under certain conditions so you can see

362
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,279
what stress looks like but from a body

363
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,570
language point of view the first thing

364
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,680
that we would look at is just these

365
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,839
three things

366
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,149
you basically assess them when you're

367
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:12,770
looking at a subject is this person are

368
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,350
they confident or do they lack

369
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,029
confidence right just generally without

370
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,649
any other trained and remember that

371
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:22,010
we've got only used words for about

372
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:23,450
ninety thousand years as a species but

373
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,579
we've been communicating for millions of

374
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,440
years as long as you don't believe in in

375
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:29,930
that we just landed a 2,000 years ago or

376
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,820
whatever and and so we've always

377
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,770
communicated without words right so

378
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,510
you've got a lot going for you up front

379
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,430
so they confidence are not are they

380
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,170
comfortable or not I'm particularly and

381
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,540
pacifically in there not so much a cyber

382
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,290
security well but insecurities are they

383
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,480
calm or agitated okay now all that is as

384
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,230
data we don't conclude it's just is it

385
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,890
this or is

386
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,560
is it they stories of this once we know

387
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,300
that and once we establish I am

388
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,130
someone's kind of base state and I'm

389
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,380
going to talk more about that later and

390
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,950
the next thing to know is what stress

391
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,990
looks like in a human being to tell a

392
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,130
lie to the other dishonest or deceptive

393
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,600
is a stress factor in human beings and

394
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,970
because it's a stress factor it kicks

395
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,820
off certain things in our physiology and

396
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,560
particularly in the brain so what we're

397
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,970
dealing here with here and I'm very

398
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
careful to say this is he's sitting

399
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,820
right next to me is the autonomic

400
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,360
nervous system or ans right is it just

401
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:33,950
me not got no so what that does the

402
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,260
autonomic nervous system and it controls

403
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,720
the automatic functions of the body okay

404
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,450
and what it does is it sends signals out

405
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,280
to the heart the lungs internal organs

406
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,170
new glands particularly in the reason

407
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,880
glands are important is because they

408
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,589
start to make the chemicals that assist

409
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,040
in fight or flight which I'll show you

410
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,700
in a minute

411
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,250
and but the the autonomic nervous system

412
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,560
is associated with the threat okay

413
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,140
and so what it does is it's constantly

414
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,910
scouring the environment looking for

415
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,290
threats to your well-being or for

416
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,909
anything significant to your well-being

417
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,699
and it's due and it automatically

418
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,130
without you realizing it if it was more

419
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,380
conscious it'd be slower and it wouldn't

420
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,850
save you so you can imagine if you drive

421
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,310
no long and a car pulls out in front of

422
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,020
you a whole heap of things happen you

423
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,030
know you might go through the brake you

424
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,329
might turn the wheel but before you've

425
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,410
even turned to do that your pupils are

426
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,409
dilated to taking the threat and then

427
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,760
constrict it to focus upon it and a lot

428
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,200
of other things are happening you've got

429
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,940
a chemical cocktail going through your

430
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,760
system everything getting ready to

431
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,490
protect you but it's not subconscious we

432
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,660
call it opaque to consciousness so it's

433
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,670
kind of happen and even beyond

434
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,400
subconscious okay and it's there to

435
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:46,910
protect you and we use in social

436
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,740
engineering because what we know is that

437
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,470
if we can get someone into an emotional

438
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,690
state we can override the part of the

439
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,690
brain the neocortex which is actually

440
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,040
your thinking brain okay so what happens

441
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,650
is the thalamus here

442
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,110
sorry biology lesson um the thalamus

443
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,690
here processes visual in order to audio

444
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,629
signals common in from that automatic

445
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:12,540
system and it passes passes it through

446
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,890
to the rest of the brain it goes pretty

447
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,060
much straight to the amygdala which

448
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,790
controls emotion

449
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,340
the amygdala works very very quickly and

450
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,889
overrides everything else and so we act

451
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,389
in that emotional fog and that's where

452
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,160
social engineering comes in because if

453
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,870
you can raise that in a pace and their

454
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,460
decision-making capacity just plummets

455
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,929
okay finally when the threat goes and

456
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,970
when the state starts to kind of climb

457
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,010
down for that emotional state that

458
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,690
informations pass to the neocortex which

459
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,460
is the human the rational part of the

460
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,020
brain and we have more time to think

461
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,610
about it which is why all the floor

462
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,830
programs and everything's help people to

463
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:50,280
take - and to step back and just come

464
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,560
away from the immediate situation and

465
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,660
the thing is when you lie it's a state

466
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,310
of fear as much as anything else a case

467
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,810
of stress and fear are very similar in

468
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:04,050
this particular area and fear is a

469
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:07,020
prescription right so we're all scared

470
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,120
of some universal things just as humans

471
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,040
but every human scared edition thinks oh

472
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,750
I'm scared of spiders there'll be people

473
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:17,010
our neighbors probably pets by just

474
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,650
given the crowd so um so it's on a

475
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,510
spectrum of stress okay so let's imagine

476
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,330
that you're an insider threat of some

477
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,770
other am bad actor and someone's

478
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,199
investigating you and talking to you

479
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,730
what do you what happens to you from

480
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,860
that autonomic nervous system that you

481
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:34,830
can't do anything about and we go into

482
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,649
the freeze fight and flight mechanism so

483
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,449
in freeze mode now not everyone does

484
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,400
this in the exact same order by the way

485
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,540
and that the strength of it's different

486
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,250
for different people because people

487
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,500
individual can control things

488
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,200
differently but typically what we see

489
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,300
first is that people go into sort of

490
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,620
rabbit in the headlights syndrome right

491
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,080
to the becomes slower and what they do

492
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,580
they have little flash freezes when we

493
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,780
interview them and I film a lot of it

494
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,960
and then analyze it later

495
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,580
I am the nervous system starts to raise

496
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,740
the blood pressure the breasts become a

497
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,169
bit shallow and but the main thing that

498
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,960
we see in interview is that you find

499
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,510
motor skills

500
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,250
knocked out by this state so what

501
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,830
happens is people will if they're

502
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:18,460
sipping water or wherever they'll put

503
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,840
the cup down and if they draw in or do

504
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,600
and I think else they stop everything

505
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,240
become a lot more still if that doesn't

506
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,129
work in other words because keep and

507
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,840
still is your best defense against a

508
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,720
predator right if you've got you've seen

509
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,600
Jurassic Park most of the movement right

510
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,730
I am but what the thing is in this

511
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,129
situation in investigators interview

512
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,470
they can't get away so they go into

513
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,260
flight mode from what happens in flight

514
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,480
mode the blood gets directed to the legs

515
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,590
by the autonomic nervous system because

516
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,920
that your biggest muscles are in your

517
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,500
legs

518
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,940
so that's your best chance of escape so

519
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,540
now you've got blood come through your

520
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,040
legs

521
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,080
you've got chemicals coursing through

522
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,750
your system and everything's telling you

523
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,550
to get away but you can't get away right

524
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,930
the threat is still there so what

525
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,340
happens as we have near this energy and

526
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,380
people start to fidget and that's where

527
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,419
certainly law enforcement over the years

528
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,830
have told me the fidgeting and stuff is

529
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,610
a sure sign for them that something's

530
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,990
wrong okay

531
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,810
and what is if you're trying to get rid

532
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,520
of that energy but you can't run and but

533
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,100
the edge two runs there and it becomes

534
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,250
irresistible finally if that doesn't

535
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,439
work we go to fight mode and our

536
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,820
proximity to other people becomes closer

537
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,870
if you want to have a factor that is

538
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,790
just put your hand

539
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,050
don't touch the person next year but

540
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,820
just what the fingers close to their

541
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,980
face as you possibly can without

542
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,780
touching them I see so many people

543
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,640
didn't even do it you don't like it

544
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,200
because you become a space invader right

545
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,900
but in fight mode you get closer to

546
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,150
people the eyes focus on the object of

547
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,910
the attack your brain sharp and some

548
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,680
starts to recall things and natural

549
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,240
anesthetics kick in so if you're

550
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,640
introduced about the ability to run away

551
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,800
that's why you feel pain sometimes after

552
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,210
the fact but what tends to happen in

553
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,490
that situation is that we don't

554
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:01,120
physically fight anymore we argue and

555
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,410
because we've evolved so what happens is

556
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,969
you've got assert that you've got a

557
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,040
subject you think as guilty you've got

558
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,570
them under pressure you see in these

559
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,450
stress signs and now you've got a choice

560
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,220
and the choice day is do we keep them

561
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:15,700
under pressure or to be like them off

562
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,930
and that's up to the investigator so I

563
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,890
just want to finish with a few things

564
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,600
just before

565
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,070
time's up I just want to show you three

566
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,379
things about linguistic flags and

567
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,600
indicators right now so say please just

568
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,090
take this as a starter pattern do not go

569
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,250
home and judge people for the first

570
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,260
thing that we would do is ask the

571
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,240
subject to talk about whatever the event

572
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,250
or events are that were asking them

573
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,780
about to see if they're guilty and what

574
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,210
we're looking at for here is narrative

575
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,879
balance so story should have a beginning

576
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:44,230
a middle and an end

577
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,120
typically and remember I'm only saying

578
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,010
typically because it's so nuanced but

579
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,770
typically an innocent person will tell

580
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,379
the story or focus a lot on the heart of

581
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,050
the matter what most people who ask

582
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:59,440
questions and interviews don't do is

583
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:01,389
focus on the real topic in hand right so

584
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,280
criminals and Liars can talk for any

585
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,810
amount of time about their journey and

586
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,250
what they have for lunch and everything

587
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,950
else it's when you get on to the actual

588
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,280
subject that they accused of or all the

589
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,990
difficulty and that they have trouble so

590
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,570
we get them to focus on that so it's a

591
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,640
story and what make sure they focus on

592
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,159
the middle bit safer believe or tell no

593
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,390
lie we focus more on what's not the

594
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:28,390
topic all the indicators refusal to

595
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,430
answer the question right so if you're

596
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,230
asked a question like it most innocent

597
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,570
people if I said - did you kill someone

598
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,810
on Tuesday you'll know unless you did

599
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,460
and again who knows this crowd did you

600
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,129
kill someone to sing now but

601
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,570
unfortunately all typically liars

602
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,220
wouldn't do that they'd start talking

603
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,850
about other things they change the

604
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,830
subject

605
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,320
you have a comfort break or the answer

606
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:53,379
another question well let me tell you

607
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,290
about Tuesday the other thing that they

608
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,240
do and innocent people don't do this but

609
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,500
often guilty people do this as they

610
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,690
start making what we call hailing

611
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,860
statements is so they say things like

612
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm on my honor as God is my witness why

613
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,060
you ask to me you know I've always been

614
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,640
a great employee right where's innocent

615
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,780
people time to go no I didn't do it how

616
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,370
could you possibly accuse me of that

617
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,649
it's not company policy that's like the

618
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,060
thing the reason is is the two full

619
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,190
witnesses the more confident the facts

620
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,690
will prove what they're saying so they

621
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,929
don't need to say I'm a good person

622
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,789
right

623
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,069
there's also flat refusal to deny if you

624
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,449
remember this scene from Game of Thrones

625
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:32,369
where she said she should be felt little

626
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:36,149
fingers crimes and after everyone she

627
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:38,069
says do you deny it and he never denies

628
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:39,478
it and it unfortunately were not

629
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:43,229
unfortunately but typically that's the

630
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:44,399
case they just fail yet to deny the

631
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,259
other thing is is not answering the

632
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,958
question with javis answer in a general

633
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:51,659
question right so did your more back

634
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:53,489
Hill all those people well she would

635
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,139
never fly yeah but we're not talking

636
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:58,049
about a fly we're talking about people

637
00:24:55,139 --> 00:25:02,519
she's accused imagine do you say I'm

638
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:05,039
really the last one distance and

639
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,359
language you know I am typically when

640
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,089
someone's lying in my still to us they

641
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,399
won't use hair or the name so in

642
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:13,229
strategy or not uses that woman and then

643
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,319
says her name after pause we caught

644
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:17,819
response latency so typically and this

645
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,859
would be an indicator when this came on

646
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,158
everyone in the community the latest

647
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:24,569
action community and the phone yeah if

648
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,919
I'm was kind of pinging each other and

649
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:28,918
everything else because it was very

650
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,609
clear indicator truthful people their

651
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,319
story is logical by which I mean often

652
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,689
when someone's telling you either just

653
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,039
the fuck still nods off so we had an

654
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,199
incident once where someone said well

655
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,719
you know I was in they were saying that

656
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:44,219
they were important say at nine o'clock

657
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:46,829
in the morning but the thief managed to

658
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:49,349
get to Aberdeen for example by lunchtime

659
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:51,869
the fuck is just a lot of snot logical

660
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:54,448
it's not consistent we also have issues

661
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:58,649
of aim you might think about what

662
00:25:54,449 --> 00:26:00,299
details right when people tell them the

663
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:02,579
truth what happens saves your memory

664
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:04,289
memories of rubbish I have manipulate

665
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:05,789
your memory lighting give all the time

666
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:07,619
in where we can manipulate memory become

667
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,719
pictures and images numbers and people's

668
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:11,369
heads all the time but when you'd be man

669
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:14,039
during something because the truths on

670
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,619
your side things pop into your head all

671
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,269
the time so you come up with IEDs silly

672
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,418
details that aren't really relevant to

673
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,739
the story the story pops all around so

674
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,239
you never heared at one point and then

675
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:26,399
you can go backwards and forwards you

676
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:29,190
can move along the truthful story really

677
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,258
easily because you'll be member in but a

678
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,449
liar typically will be here's a story

679
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,010
from start to finish so if you ask them

680
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:36,960
to go in and out of that Marisa

681
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,460
it's quite a difficult thing to do and

682
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,280
what they probably haven't flossed to do

683
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,200
is put some irrelevant detail in you

684
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,470
know so when I say relevant details it

685
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,600
might be like over since a few Mon lady

686
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,190
and she said oh yes I mean though it was

687
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,480
a really it was a big fraud and way and

688
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,580
there was a lot of money at stake and

689
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,350
she'd been socially engineered so she's

690
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,540
why I was looking on it and you know I

691
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,490
remember that day sharing I look good

692
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,720
because I cut my hands and actually

693
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,770
there was blood all over the post-it

694
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,270
knows was horrible actually people

695
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,930
wondered well that's not one to do with

696
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,960
this is it

697
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,210
well no it's nah right but you wouldn't

698
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,590
remember it we'll put that in unless you

699
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,240
would be mad you know it's like it's

700
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:16,139
unlikely Ally would put those kinds of

701
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,660
details and um so memory remembers

702
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:23,970
relevancy as much as two elephants okay

703
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,680
and then we use emotions I got no time

704
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,960
today stored you anymore about emotions

705
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,190
but you know the study of and the

706
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,080
manipulation that's at the heart of

707
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,310
social engineering but the way it

708
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,889
affects people's at the heart a lie

709
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,350
detection as well so I just wanna am

710
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,750
before we go into our se how we did on

711
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,790
our lie detection I'm just gonna give

712
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,190
you this sexy model it's really

713
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,060
important that I tell you this because

714
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,880
some of the stuff I just tell you is

715
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,379
fairly powerful I am and I don't want

716
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,630
you to just go in and use it so this is

717
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,220
the way it works the first thing you do

718
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,810
when you learn a subject is you look at

719
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,880
the baseline for the subject

720
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,110
okay so what's that person like when

721
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,210
they've no reason to I see you and

722
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,860
they're not under pressure once you have

723
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,110
that baseline established you'll home

724
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,270
for a change in state so a very both

725
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,159
space and stop store in a relaxed pace

726
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,740
and becomes more agitated that type of

727
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,020
thing when you see that the context is

728
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,910
everything so nine times out of ten you

729
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,620
know if people are rubbing their eyes or

730
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,990
squinting or touching the face that can

731
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,100
be a deceptive sign but often it's just

732
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,680
because they're tired or they're looking

733
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,290
into the Sun we look for clusters not

734
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,920
single signals and we offer congruence

735
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,330
so is what they say a matching off with

736
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,640
the way they behave not and all these

737
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,580
interfaces if you think you see

738
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,280
something it is not an opportunity to

739
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,830
draw conclusions to project to suggest

740
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,870
it's just a circle action and at that

741
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,418
point it's your cue to use question and

742
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,248
technique

743
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,049
in order to get that pair some more

744
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:48,820
under pressure that under sistine off

745
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,079
their time the truth or a lie but I've

746
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,700
no time to tell you about questioning

747
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,928
techniques you just have to ask me back

748
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,489
to Dublin actually if you want to know

749
00:28:52,929 --> 00:29:00,609
about that so wanna say so if we can

750
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:01,989
have our three volunteers up again I'm

751
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,879
going you just tell the same story again

752
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:05,169
and then if no one can do anything from

753
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:08,379
it and don't tell us if you're like if

754
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,789
you got the light AB and if ya and I'm

755
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:17,769
just gonna ask for show hands we'll see

756
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:19,749
how we did my favorite meal was in a

757
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:22,209
restaurant called Peter Lugar's in New

758
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:25,629
York City with two friends who are

759
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:28,359
fortunate with us and I particularly

760
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:31,418
remember it because I seen the

761
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,499
restaurant on a TV show and I'd heard

762
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:34,690
that they hung to meet themselves

763
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:38,679
downstairs where I asked a view it's the

764
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:40,869
waiter said to me I can't let you do

765
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:42,700
that because you might slip and have an

766
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:51,339
accident which sounded more like a

767
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:52,779
threat than a warning my memorable meal

768
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,729
was with my mum at the which we

769
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:56,769
restaurant in Edinburgh and it was

770
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:58,119
really memorable because it was newsy we

771
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:06,700
were watching the fireworks out as a

772
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:08,468
window and my what my memorable meal was

773
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,759
that Liz Hall in New York City and would

774
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:11,529
just happen to be that Colin Farrell

775
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,729
sitting at the next seat and I'll leave

776
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,729
in the back is pretty much accepted

777
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:27,090
all right so if you just done my chairs

778
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,710
I don't you remain standing so from a

779
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,689
show of hands can have a show of hands

780
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,389
who thinks that Tom what you've Tom for

781
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:38,759
me hands up if you think Tom was the one

782
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:40,830
Tom the lie okay hands down never show

783
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:46,259
of hands if you thought that it was date

784
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:50,129
you tell my hands down if you thought it

785
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:52,139
was Sarah okay hands down if I could ask

786
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:53,519
the two people tell the truth to sit

787
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:57,379
down and the patient on the lie to

788
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,379
remain standing and thanks for listening

789
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,619
[Applause]
