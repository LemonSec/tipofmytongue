1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:07,258
okay good afternoon everyone very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,540
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I would like to talk about an</font>

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,019
issue that has also related to the GDP

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,020
are but that has not attracted and as

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,310
much attention as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deserves at least</font>

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,150
according to me to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're working</font>

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">on a project on this issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is</font>

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,130
the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the gdp are all my</font>

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,910
children not only young children but

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:36,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">also adolescence so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can all</font>

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,620
agree we all know that from birds or in

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,900
some cases even before birth birth and

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,980
enormous amounts of data are collected

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:50,760
from children these data are collected

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,800
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> public bodies by governments by</font>

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,980
school for instance education

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,050
departments of course by private

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,790
companies we heard a lot about at this

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,438
morning and and in some cases also

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,889
parents play a role in disclosing

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,529
information about their children in the

22
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:13,770
digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment so enormous amount</font>

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:18,359
of data so I think we can all very much

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,699
agree that children are data<font color="#CCCCCC"> subjects</font>

25
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,759
and I think a second thing that we can

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree on is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> children have a right</font>

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,990
to protection this is me lay down in

28
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,549
many international instruments the

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,350
united<font color="#CCCCCC"> nations convention on the rights</font>

30
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,259

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,398
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights of children and the fact</font>

37

40
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,819
good job in technology that children

41
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,649
have a right to perfection in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">both in recitals and in the article and</font>

47
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,730
there are a few articles there on the

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,049
instance we already heard about data

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,840
protection by design or by default and

54
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,180
children are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned explicitly in</font>

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,209
that but perhaps this article in its

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can mean something for</font>

00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:01,080
children we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an article that</font>

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,780
says that any<font color="#CCCCCC"> information on the</font>

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,920
processing of data of children needs to

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,200
be made clear to them in language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,839
is understandable for them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">language that is a child child friendly</font>

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,160
and so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some opportunities</font>

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,290
within the GDP are to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,190
better protection of children when<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

personal data are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> processed but in</font>

67
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:35,579
this discussion there is a risk that the

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,070
right to protection might endanger other

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,280
rights of children so for instance their

70
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,750
rights to participation you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CRC so</font>

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,880
the United Nations Convention on the

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,860
Rights of the Child states very clearly

73
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,980
that children will not only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right</font>

74
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,260
to protection but also to participation

75
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:55,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that means for instance participating</font>

76
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">in online social network services in the</font>

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:04,350
digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to an important</font>

78
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:07,410
extent and one article of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gdp are</font>

79
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,130
and it's particularly relevant in this

80
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,579
context and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> article 8 article 8</font>

81
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,829
states that if if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a provider of</font>

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,410
information society services and you

want to use consent as a basis to

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,890
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal data of children you</font>

85
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,500
need to obtain parental consent if the

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:32,190
data

87
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:35,520
is of a child<font color="#CCCCCC"> under 16 years of age I</font>

88
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:39,040
suppose that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all know that the Coppa</font>

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,440
law in the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a</font>

90
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,540
similar principle but they're the age

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,270
limit is set at 13 in the proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:53,320
the commission for the GDP are the HS

93
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:57,580
also 13 is only in the very late stages

94
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,010
of the legislative process that<font color="#CCCCCC"> age has</font>

95
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">been increased to sixteen years of age</font>

96
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,640
however there is a possibility in the

97
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,919
article and to lower the age so national

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,159
legislators<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take an active decision</font>

99
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,130
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower the age but it cannot be</font>

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:22,090
lower than 13 so they can decide that

101
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the HM is 13 14 15</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and or 16 and so an</font>

102
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:29,440
if data is processed of children under

103
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,260
this particular age age that will be

104
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,760
chosen there is a need for parental and

105
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:40,360
consent and what does this lead to or

106
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,820
what is over not totally correct the

what is what carrot lead to in the

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,250

category of children children are

usually defined as under 18 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font>

113
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case in the u.s. PRC and in this</font>

114
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,240
implementation of the gdp are you will

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,849
have a group of children under this age

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,610
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen or if it's not chosen</font>

117
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,770
it will be standard 16 and then we will

118
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a group of children between that</font>

age between 13 and 18 between 14 and 18

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,340
and and so on there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

121
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that arise with regard to the</font>

122
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,229
implementation and of course the first

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,790
question is well now the standard age is

124
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:33,820
16 shoots national legislators<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:37,840
consider to lower this age 2 30 of

126
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,400
course industry will be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

127
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,979
lobbying for this

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,979
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> H is 13 in in the US but I</font>

129
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:50,139
think if a choice is made it needs to be

130
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:53,530
based on something it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be based</font>

131
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">on evidence on how children use online</font>

132
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,940
services on their understanding of data

133
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:05,440
collection practices and so not just a

134
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:08,620
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a government to take an</font>

135
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,080
age without any and without any basis

136
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:16,840
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it will be a big challenge</font>

137
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:20,229
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpas to to enforce these these</font>

138
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,780
provisions it will probably be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in either</font>

139
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:27,449
biggest challenge for the company the

140
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:30,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">data controllers if they choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

141
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:33,940
implement parental concern because

142
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:37,740
another possibility is that they simply

143
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide to exclude children under the age</font>

144
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:44,800
of parental consent and that is the

145
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,780

services that are currently very

149
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,460
important to them so it will possibly

150
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:01,050
have a negative effect on their freedom

education rights literacy right so that

153
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:13,389
is an a real real question that we need

154
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:17,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that we need</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start a dialogue parental consent in</font>

156
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,280
itself is a problematic concept because

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,090
you will not always be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on</font>

158
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,489
parents in certain situations parents

category<font color="#E5E5E5"> of children so the suppose that</font>

level as adults but is this fair

169
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,329
shouldn't we consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">group especially for very privacy</font>

171

intrusive and practices data collection

172
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:10,949
practices there should also be extra

173
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:14,580
safeguards for this group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

174
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,220
subjects so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think my main message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

175
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are many important decisions</font>

176
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,620
ahead and with regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this issue</font>

177
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,040
decisions for national legislators

178
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,790
decisions for dps on for instance

179
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,209
guidance that they could issue in this

180
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:37,099
respect and decisions by beta

181
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:41,010
controllers how they will and deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

182
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this article 8 but also other articles</font>

183
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:47,550
that have an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on children</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

184
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,770
think also that children deserve an

185
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:53,609
evidence-based approach so these

186
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:57,150
decisions that will be made and I think

187
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary that</font>

188
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,040
we take advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the evidence that</font>

189
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">we already have at the moment and of</font>

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,740
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of research still has to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

191
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,439
done that we do have already a good body

192
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,770
of research on how children use online

193
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,870
services on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> under 13 year old</font>

194
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,819
for instance actually do have facebook

195
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,450
accounts or other accounts on other

196
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,400
social media on to what extent they

197
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,070
actually understand data collection

198
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,350
practices although I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps if</font>

199
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,930
you do the same research with adults the

200
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,120
understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> with auction of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the very</font>

201
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,489
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course also very important</font>

202
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,510
insights into technology these

203
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,780
technologies for instance that will

204
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,990
verify parental consent are they

205
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:51,120
effective can they be circumvented also

206
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:56,850
from that area inputs will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary</font>

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:59,160
so I would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this issue a</font>

208
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit higher on the policy agenda</font>

209
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,160
the GDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> are is a huge piece piece of</font>

210
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:08,160
legislation there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do 40 p 8</font>

211
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,600
for instance and this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> always gets</font>

212
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
a little bit to the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

213
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,389
priority list and I do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it deserves</font>

214
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,389
more attention thank you

215
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,789
