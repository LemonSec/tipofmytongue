5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:21,749
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago with some research to find out</font>

6
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:25,960
what does already exist in the field of

7
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:27,848
yeah who does what kind of work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,519
to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> children how they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can protect</font>

9
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,769
their privacy so we had a bit of look

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,030
around checked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font>

11
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:41,440
organizations or veggie dish and then

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:48,699
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill again so we found out that</font>

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:51,250
most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations mostly yeah</font>

14
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:54,460
target speed parents either parents so

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:56,739
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to tell them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to control</font>

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,010
their their children's communications

17
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,629
better or they try to tell kids yeah

18
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,319
don't talk to any strangers on the

19
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:09,250
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so we wanted to do</font>

20
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:12,279
something different and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we</font>

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,560
have yeah we've done together with many

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our member organizations this short</font>

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,840
comic comic book list so our main

24
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,860
motivation was really to empower kids to

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,180
give them some tools in order to

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,120
understand how their data is collected

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,410
online and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some really hands-on</font>

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,720
guidance on for example installing the

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:38,229
signal private messenger so to give them

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,720
really alternatives to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data</font>

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:46,590
collection apps that are out there so

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:51,490
the booklet was published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October</font>

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:54,400
