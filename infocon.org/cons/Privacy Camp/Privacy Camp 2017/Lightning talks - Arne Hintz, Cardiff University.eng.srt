next up<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm making from Cardiff</font>

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:11,969
University and with a presentation of

sales data justice<font color="#E5E5E5"> class you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this will</font>

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:22,198
be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> short to party because um yeah</font>

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,550
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discreet input but partly</font>

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,410
also because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still trying to</font>

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">figure out to what actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data just as</font>

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,080
mean and that's what we'll try to do

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,059
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next time while and so on what</font>

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,699
I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about now for a</font>

11
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,250
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we got to think</font>

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it about Kyle some of the things</font>

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're all doing in these terms and</font>

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,739
why we think it is useful and important

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think about it or to broaden our</font>

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,038
perspective in this in this way so um

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,899
yes I'm from college university a few of

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,789
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small group of us are creating</font>

19
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,199
something at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment that we for the</font>

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,329
data justice class so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so and</font>

21
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,129
there are a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> for there's two</font>

22
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,159
main starting points really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to</font>

23
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in these terms one where</font>

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,510
the responses to the Snowden revelations

25
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,700
and all our attempts as we've heard also

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">an hour to protect ourselves from</font>

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,979
surveillance and very often these

28
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:21,500
intensities responder responses have

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,810
been technol legal in one way or another

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,479
technical of course with encryption

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,610
anonymization tools and so on very<font color="#CCCCCC"> um a</font>

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of really good work is going to</font>

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,470
happen there but yeah typically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

34
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,619
think about technical forms of

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,289
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> its and anonymization it's an</font>

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,659
individual act that each of us each

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,140
individual is responsible for its an

38
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,360
individualized response in a way to to

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,540
the problem of today on also it's

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,100
something that not so many people at the

41
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,840
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day or even until 30</font>

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,360
organizations and even activists are

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,890
actually doing part of a research

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,329
project that we did there was called

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,240
digital citizenship and surveillance

46
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,089
society was what included interviews

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,770
with ya digital rights organizations and

48
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,539
activists but also broader range of

49
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,760
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> and economic and political I</font>

50
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,649
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the well it's kind of</font>

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,370
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all know but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

52
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:21,250
again shoulders how well how how

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,250
distinct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still the discourses are in</font>

54
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,980
these two counts and how the broader<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,680
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the non-digital the offline</font>

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">activists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really what did not see much</font>

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,900
of a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in dealing with this and said</font>

58
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,849
well we kind of let let me do so rights

59
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,439
groups and so on deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that there's</font>

60
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:45,069
there's a big separation in a way that

61
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:48,189
was kind of striking again and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

62
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,379
aspect the legal response on has well

63
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,180
included court cases and policy vaca

64
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">support cases against various regimes</font>

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,980
were often quite successful in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font>

66
00:02:54,579 --> 00:03:01,060
and 12 welcome where I work now in the

67
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,298
UK very much so<font color="#CCCCCC"> faulty advocacy not so</font>

68
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,069
much if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the British case with</font>

69
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,260
the investigatory powers act and so on a

70
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,638
lot of really good workers have gone

71
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:15,970
into this in terms of advocacy but yeah

72
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,519
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with limited results and again</font>

73
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,430
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an act as a response to</font>

74
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,010
surveillance limited to typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

75
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,079
small expert communities there were a

76
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,569
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like in the UK for example tons</font>

77
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,810
of meetings and and also public events

78
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,238
but always like within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same the same</font>

79
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,400
groups of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so our observation</font>

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,409
in that sense is that these responses

81
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,799
have remained often within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

82
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:44,078
specialized discourse often within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,079
specific specialized constituency of of

84
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:51,849
experts and be the second area of course

85
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,379
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> um is stratification we're not as</font>

86
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,599
we're doing today<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

87
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,978
talking anymore only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

88
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,840
surveillance of emails and chats and

89
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,060
social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all that but about the</font>

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,459
tracking of all our movements online and

91
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,560
offline and everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tracking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

92
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,150
our health and our bodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tracking</font>

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,409
of our homes and our movements in our

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,659
homes and all that this is what's

95
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:13,209
basically many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

96
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:16,149
about am today and data<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a new form of</font>

97
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,909
governance that decides on through the

98
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:21,159
increasing use of data scores what

99
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,630
services we have access to whether we

100
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:25,330
can cross the border and remote

101
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,930
what happens if we arrested and so on

102
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,729
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one there's a lot of journalism</font>

103
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,070
recently about data scores and

104
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,610
increasing your also some research<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

105
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:40,180
shows really data yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means of</font>

106
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,500
control and power and this then raises a

107
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:46,060
few questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm rather than protecting</font>

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,670
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> indecorum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in addition to</font>

109
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,920
protecting our individual privacy are we

110
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">not all or should we not also be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

111
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,090
about or addressing a broader question

112
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,880
now we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a broader</font>

113
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,669
question of social justice in times of

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,190
data fication on how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> power between</font>

115
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,720
citizens and the state arm shift what

116
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,910
does this mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for classic civil</font>

117
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,580
liberties and and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course a democracy</font>

118
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,400
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what we are</font>

119
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:16,510
interested in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data justice lab</font>

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,219
it's partly on a an academic interest

121
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,810
we're working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> University and so</font>

122
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,380
we're interested in understanding what

123
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,880
social justice means in the context of

124
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,310
data fication in the age of data

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,130
fication but it's also practical in a

126
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,590
way that well yes encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> and policy</font>

127
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,590
pocket see have had quite some some good

128
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,989
effects but in some areas in other areas

129
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,390
a little bit limited many<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philip ciety</font>

130
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:43,000
groups outside of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> white circles</font>

131
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,940
are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly disconnected from this</font>

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,340
and the wider public very often ignores

133
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,980
this so what do we do as not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

134
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:55,020
academics but also as activists and

135
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:58,660
concerned citizens in that in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

136
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,609
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data just to spend entail</font>

137
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,930
and what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this is</font>

138
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,850
still something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

139
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,280
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out as I said yes of course it</font>

140
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">includes tech design yes of course it</font>

141
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,150
includes<font color="#CCCCCC"> our policy campaigns and from</font>

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">up from an academic perspective</font>

143
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,380
investigations into database

144
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,190
discrimination into the use of data for

145
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:24,130
