no time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> guard informations themselves</font>

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,340
because they have to work like three

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,950
the aim is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the whole movie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">enough bandwidth to join at a whole</font>

who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to watch a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> videos</font>

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have</font>

76
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,690
funding yet is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quote that i have</font>

77
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">been told by a producer last year in</font>

78
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">from we do not need yet another movie</font>

79
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,410
and privacy and surveillance we know

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,060
everything about it so you can see that

81
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">people seem to be a little bit fed up</font>

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,820
with the issue and especially if you try

83
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,280
to convince big producers with a lot of

84
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">money to fund a documentary that has</font>

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:20,130
been done by a singular person with no

86
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,839
wealth status yet an excellent but what

87
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,310
this film<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to do differently</font>

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,229
than all the other films are out there

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,110
and there are amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources out</font>

90
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,820
there which I really love and really

91
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,160
have to collaborate with as well with

92
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,990
the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make them is that</font>

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,570
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going strongly not only an</font>

94
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,360
accessibility but also an inclusion that

95
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,340
means that for me the narrator<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as</font>

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,550
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to narrow</font>

97
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:48,239
so what you or anyone who watch this

98
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,880
film will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily see while</font>

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching it are the usual suspects you</font>

100
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,620
can always get conferences and I'm not

101
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to knock against anyone here but</font>

102
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,110
I'm trying not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have too many</font>

103
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,300
interviewees to a white man and then has

104
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,300
a reason because the film is not only

105
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">made for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Western European us American</font>

106
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,260
or Canadian audience but it is

107
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,640
definitely made for all the other people

108
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,370
in the planet who do not feel

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,469
represented and who wants maybe want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,600
have people from their own background or

111
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,320
from similar experiences to themselves

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,930
talking about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and so far I've</font>

113
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,719
interviewed nine people those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:33,300
ones you can see here and there's a type

115
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,520
of sorry and and not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are in</font>

116
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trailer because when I enter the</font>

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
trailer was already I haven't it was

118
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,380
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finished all the other</font>

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,250
interviews and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next cool thing about</font>

120
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,550
this documentary is that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

121
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,740
an app created for mainly android phones

122
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,920
but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make it possible also</font>

123
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,320
cross platform and for which we already

124
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,350
have a mock-up which was created back in

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,880
August by leonie<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruins from the road</font>

126
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,010
app and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f is mainly the aim of the</font>

127
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,840
app is mainly to present the film not

128
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,150
only as a whole but cut down into

129
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,010
individual chapters so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier</font>

130
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,200
the adjustable possible to watch or

131
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:21,300
listen to or download than any other way

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,909
and you will be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose very</font>

specific and settings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning</font>

134
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,890
so you can choose whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

135
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">be in a very high contrast for people</font>

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,640
when it's gonna premiere at cha 2017 but

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,409
we need designers and illustrators to

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,729
create animations to make it easier

164
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,350
understandable<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the people are</font>

167
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,620
to have really easy to understand

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,870
animation and we need of course
