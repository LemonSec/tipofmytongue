1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,320
okay uh we're going to start start now

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
and we we have a couple of panelists who

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
will who will also join in a couple of

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,240
moments uh

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,920
my name is de souza and i'm a

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,000
postdoctoral researcher at tilburg

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,560
university and the panel this afternoon

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
is on regulating tech

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,720
sector transgressions in the eu before

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,519
we begin uh i wanted to mention that

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,439
that while while the panel speaks and

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,439
the panel title speaks about the eu the

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,880
conversation we're going to have today

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,120
is actually much broader and we have a

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,960
really

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
a wonderful set of speakers who come

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
from different parts of the world and

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
also with different expertise

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,520
but as we begin the conversation today i

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,039
want to say a little bit about the

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,480
project that we're working on at the

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
global data justice project which is on

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,199
sector transgressions the idea behind

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
sector transgressions

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,680
is to be able to track how firms that

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
establish themselves in one particular

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,399
sector use their computational

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
infrastructure to be able to

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
creep as well as pivot into a new kind

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
of sector uh we started the project

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,320
drawing from the work of tamashiron and

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
over the last year have been trying to

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
explore how these transgressions are not

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,439
one-off events but instead are events

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,960
that take place

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
over a period of time and end up

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,640
crowding out expertise of one of the

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
things that has struck us

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
in the past year is that

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
sector transgressions are different from

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
regular types of growth for businesses

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
different from innovation and what has

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
emerged is this idea that one it's a

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,520
context of the pandemic and the context

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,799
of timing

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,079
secondly

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
it's also a question of of how these

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
transgressions have taken place is it a

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
question of government invitation is it

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,479
a question of

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,799
companies being given legitimacy through

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,360
political connections and it's also a

53
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,759
question of how companies have used

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
their market to abuse uh positions of

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
dominance so

56
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,720
what we have uh today is

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
as a conversation which we hope will be

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
able to to understand the sec this

59
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,680
phenomena of sector transgressions

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
and and to see whether this phenomena

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
exists in different jurisdictions and

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,959
i'm really happy today to have uh

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,080
with us

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,200
uh

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
mariana really who is the general

66
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
project manager

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,599
at data privacy brazil uh i have urjdan

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,400
sabha who's a lecturer at the university

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
of amsterdam

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
i have aaron martin who works with me at

71
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
the global data justice project as well

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
as scott skinner thompson

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
who is an associate professor at the

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
university of colorado

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,280
uh law school and usha ramanathan who i

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,599
think will join us shortly who is an

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
independent research and human rights

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
activist in india

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
so what we hope today is to also look at

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
the question of what does sector

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
transgressions do in terms of the

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
dependencies it creates we're interested

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
in dependencies in terms of economic and

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
functional dependencies uh which results

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,720
in

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
how sort of power

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,519
concentrating emerges in in particular

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,879
spheres in terms of creating

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
infrastructures we're looking at ethics

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
transgressions where companies who do

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,599
not have the expertise are ending up

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,879
dominating how public sector questions

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
are sort of emerging for instance in the

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
question of public health we're also

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,239
looking at questions of political

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,799
dependencies and civic dependencies and

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
how we would like to structure the

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
conversation today is

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
around a series of questions we will

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,840
begin

101
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,799
by

102
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
and i would like to invite uh

103
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,040
mariana and then urjdan aaron and scott

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
uh

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
to reflect firstly on on how they see

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
the concept of sector transgressions in

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
their own work and in their own regions

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
and if they can do so by by starting

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
with an example of a case that they see

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
for instance in our work so far

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
uh which has been supported by the uai

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
fund one aspect that has emerged

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
repeatedly has been the ways in which

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,798
public health the public health sector

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
has been transgressed by security firms

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
such as palantir but also transgressions

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,160
taking place in edtech

118
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
transgressions that are also taking

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,199
place

120
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
in logistics and it's and these are some

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
of the sectors that we've been looking

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,199
at across nine countries in the eu and

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,840
we would also like this conversation to

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
to explore how

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
uh

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
similar similar transgressions are

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
taking place in different parts of the

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,479
world

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
so uh as we begin i'll invite mariana uh

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
to start

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
again over to you

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,840

139
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
maria nahiali i work at a daily privacy

140
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,039
brazil

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,520
research association and

142
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
over the last few um

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
maybe a little over a year

144
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,840
we have been conducting research on the

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,800
it's hard to use the word legacy of

146
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
kovid because it's not over yet

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,280
but the idea

148
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,120
and the the the general initial idea of

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,479
this research

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
was to investigate how

151
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,479
government in brazil at all levels so

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,360
not just a federal government but also

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,440
at the state level and

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,479
the

155
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,680
municipal level um

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
has

157
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,919
adopted different types of data personal

158
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,479
data based technology to

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
fight covet uh 19

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
and we didn't really start with the idea

161
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,840
or with the concept of sector

162
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,240
transgression like in terms of our

163
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
methodology this was not something that

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
was necessarily in the picture

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
but

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
as the research progressed we

167
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,039
um

168
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,720
we had some

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,160
indications some

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,360
results

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
that are pointed in this direction and

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,759
we have actually engaged with the global

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,000
data justice project and with some of

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
you we have had conversations and even

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,560
inputs

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
into our research so to answer the

177
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
question i think in brazil this is

178
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
huge because

179
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639
historically um

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,840
basically every social thought book

181
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
brazilian book

182
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
will say that the public in brazil is

183
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
private

184
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
and of course this doesn't have to do

185
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
necessarily with

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
companies but more with the dynamics of

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,319
these

188
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
players and how

189
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
these relationships developed over time

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
uh but

191
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,319
so so there are many possible examples

192
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
and i will keep to our own research

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
because this is where i think i have

194
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,120
more to contribute which is the

195
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
like i said the public health um sector

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
and we found that um

197
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
nearly 60 percent of all suppliers of

198
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
technology

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
to government like i said at all levels

200
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,039
are on the private sector mostly

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,960
technology companies

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
actually there is one company that

203
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,080
accounts for almost 20 percent of all

204
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
initiatives that we

205
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
were able to

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
map

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,520
and

208
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
um

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
we

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
we are still not i think at a point

211
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,280
where we can

212
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
say that um

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
there has been other there is there is

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
an actual transgression because we

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,720
haven't looked at the

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
the history perhaps and the journey of

217
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
these companies like

218
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
in their different sectors but we have

219
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
some um like i said indications

220
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
that this may be happening

221
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,360
um

222
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,399
and

223
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,760
these are

224
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,479
this is what has been moving us

225
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
towards continuing this research

226
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,640
and basically uh what we found was that

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,520
um

228
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,800
[Music]

229
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,959
the the three most uh common uh

230
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,000
functionalities because we maps

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
different functionalities so we're not

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
looking just at like contact tracing

233
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
we were looking at the broader uh

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,920
scenario and the three most common were

235
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,640
socialized isolation

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,000
monitoring

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
was the first one then uh tyler medicine

238
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
and

239
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
third was um

240
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,200
the

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,600
monitoring of a temperature temperature

242
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,839
use of thermal cameras

243
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,240
and there are big differences between

244
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,399
those three because the third one i

245
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,920
think it's very interesting that the

246
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
companies that are responsible are not

247
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
brazilian while the others are mostly

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
brazilian companies and in the case of

249
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
thermal technology and facial

250
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
recognition technology the companies are

251
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,839
mostly chinese

252
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,279
um

253
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,480
but

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,560
the thing that we noticed

255
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,440
was that the the

256
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
the arrangements the the contracts were

257
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
mostly

258
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,440
at no cost for the public entities and

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
this is something that appears a lot in

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,279
research

261
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
how these companies provide these

262
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
solutions without costs at first

263
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
and we are not at the point where we can

264
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,399
affirm that this will change but this is

265
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,399
also an indication of something that may

266
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,480
be happening and we are following this

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,120
closely so i think i'll stop here just

268
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,920
to

269
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
say that we are working on the public

270
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
health sector and of course another one

271
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
that is very important in brazil is

272
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,360
public security and we may

273
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,720
go into that

274
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
later but i'll start i was up here thank

275
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,199
you

276
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,320
thanks a lot mariana uh rajdan maybe if

277
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
i could ask you if if if you'd like to

278
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,800
also reflect on the phenomena of sector

279
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
transgressions and perhaps also connect

280
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
to uh as mariana mentioned the idea that

281
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
do you see this question of the public

282
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,480
being private also

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
in the regions that you've been looking

284
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,079
at

285
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,440
yeah so

286
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,880
thank you first of all thank you for

287
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
having me on this panel it's been very

288
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
interesting to

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,839
hear

290
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,360
marianna's reflection on the concept of

291
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,959
sector transgression because i can also

292
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,959
see some similarities there

293
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
with the global data justice associates

294
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,120
project which i'm working on which is

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
sector trans question in east africa

296
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
just a brief introduction there so in

297
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,360
partnership with uh data for change

298
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,680
this project looks at

299
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,399
cases of transgressive technologies in

300
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,200
ethiopia kenya and uganda and i was

301
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
humbled to work with kinfeilma

302
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,040
who are experts on law and tech and who

303
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
examine these cases and i think one

304
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
important thing is when we

305
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,519
make the concepts of sector

306
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,519
transcription go global

307
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
we also have to understand the position

308
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,079
of these visions in this highly

309
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
connected society

310
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,720
and what the researchers brought really

311
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
broadened the concept in two ways so

312
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,839
first of all it really put to the

313
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,120
forefront the

314
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
it did not only focus on tech firms but

315
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
also on this complex relation between

316
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
telecom and tech there was one one side

317
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,160
of it and the other side of it is that

318
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
it emphasized the role of development

319
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,160
agencies and tech philanthropy which

320
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
which is something that might not be as

321
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,160
visible if we look at that sector trans

322
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
question only from a high income country

323
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,279
perspective so one example there would

324
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
be that in ethiopia there is a project

325
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
called john snow which is a health

326
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,279
information system and it led the

327
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
pandemic response in many ways so they

328
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
monitored you know health sanitizers

329
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
availability tracked

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,360
health checks of

331
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
travelers entering ethiopia they

332
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,040
provided information about the the head

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
education through whatsapp helpline

334
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
and what's interesting here is that they

335
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
were brokered through usaid and they

336
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,959
worked closely with the bill and melinda

337
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,720
gates foundation

338
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
and

339
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,839
above all this this jon snow uh

340
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,959
firm

341
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,720
did not start with the pandemic it

342
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,839
predated the pandemic started in

343
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,279
2015 uh

344
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
under the under the you know

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,160
the idea of providing a health

346
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,320
information system in ethiopia and

347
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
because ethiopia has this long-standing

348
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,519
relationship with international partners

349
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,760
and it was not framed in terms of you

350
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
know pandemic response back then but it

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
was framed in terms of digital inclusion

352
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
and in terms of you know economic

353
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
development so that is to say that you

354
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
know when we look at sector

355
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
transgression we also see that it's

356
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
continuation

357
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,600
of things that have been happening in

358
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,079
the past

359
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,240
thanks a lot

360
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,920
i think you bring up an important

361
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
distinction with with also how the

362
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
project has has been framed in the in

363
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,160
the eu with the focus on the pandemic

364
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
and and the changes that have taken

365
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,079
place there but to sort of speak to a

366
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
longer a longer narrative and and i

367
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
think this is also a good opportunity to

368
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
bring in usher ramanathan um

369
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
we've been talking about how in

370
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,720
different regions of the world the the

371
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
phenomena of sector transgressions

372
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
manifests in different ways and also

373
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,600
manifests at different points in time

374
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
and i was wondering if you could share

375
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,560
uh

376
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
from india uh how do you see this uh

377
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
this phenomena emerging is it something

378
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
that has been around for a while and

379
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,600
when have you seen any sort of important

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
examples in the last couple of years

381
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
during the pandemic that that have been

382
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
different from from the past

383
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,240
we can't hear you

384
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,360
there's a speaker right at the bottom of

385
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,839
the screen

386
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
and now yes perfect yeah

387
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,800
okay

388
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
okay i'm a little uh

389
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,079
nervous about

390
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,519
entering this conversation because i'm

391
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,360
not sure i've understood

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
uh

393
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,120
sectoral transgression correctly

394
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
so let's just say i'm giving another

395
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,120
take on it yeah so

396
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
uh

397
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,759
if it is about

398
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,199
see one of the things we i think we

399
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,160
spoke about it the last time too that

400
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
technology persons and technology and

401
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,839
people who are

402
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,880
leveraging technology for their business

403
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,920
are

404
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
not satisfied with finding an area where

405
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
they can be they are very keen to

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
take as much as they can because tech

407
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,079
now is not about any sector it's about

408
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,120
data

409
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,920
and data from any sector is exciting

410
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
for them so there is there are no

411
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
boundaries in this

412
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
second thing in india it's

413
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
i'm sure there are other countries like

414
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,480
this where the relationship between uh

415
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
tech com you know tech interests i won't

416
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,839
call them companies they are tech

417
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,199
interests and

418
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
the government

419
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,360
uh

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,839
it's very close so there are things that

421
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,759
take uh you know the tech interest

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
promises the state and you know promises

423
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,680
the government and the government

424
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
uh

425
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
creates a good ambiance for

426
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
take for the tech interest to do

427
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
whatever it is that they want to do

428
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
in india it is represented most darkly

429
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
and most clearly in this thing called

430
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
the iceberg

431
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,759
which is the

432
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,279
uh

433
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,279
it's an industry roundtable it's like we

434
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
had the nashcom which was made up of or

435
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
you know it was a association of all the

436
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
big tech companies

437
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
and then they decided that you know some

438
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
of the smaller guys needed to come in

439
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
and it you know it shouldn't be just

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
amazon and facebook and google and what

441
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
have you so they thought that they would

442
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,240
create other products

443
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
so the whole thing became about creating

444
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
products for the first one when they

445
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
first began and then it got hijacked by

446
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the id project that we had

447
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
and creating what they called were

448
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,720
stacks

449
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,959
so these stacks are not these stacks are

450
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
applications and they can and the idea

451
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,439
was that we'll create a platform

452
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,160
and

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,439
the the and it'll create the

454
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
infrastructure and anybody can use it

455
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,799
to create any kind of business that they

456
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,600
want so actually i'm not sure therefore

457
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
that they really

458
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
that the companies have been necessarily

459
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,480
looking at it as something that is

460
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,440
sectoral but the state has been looking

461
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,919
to bring everything on to these so that

462
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,000
data can be collected from everywhere

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
it's using the muscle power of the state

464
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,000
to be able to collect data from so if i

465
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,559
was just to give a few illustrative

466
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
things it's now in agriculture

467
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
it's in finance it's the fintech and but

468
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
it's not only fintech it's also the

469
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
whole welfare state is done only through

470
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,799
this

471
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,360
it's in fast tag which is the toll

472
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
collection

473
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
it is in registration of driving

474
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,000
licenses and in registration of vehicles

475
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,919
which are which data by the way is what

476
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,200
they've told them in parliament that

477
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
they're selling this data for a certain

478
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,240
sum

479
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,919
most recently they've been saying they

480
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
want to link up the voter id

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
with the id database

482
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
it's in

483
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
the corvin app which is supposed to be

484
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
holding all the information

485
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,679
on uh

486
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,320
you know you can only get yourself

487
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
vaccinated if you go through the

488
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
covenant or whoever vaccinates you will

489
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
have to put you on the covenant and

490
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,440
there is a set of information that's

491
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
held there which then converts itself

492
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
into a

493
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,280
health id if you give your uid along and

494
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
if you give the id along with it

495
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,200
there's a social security quote which

496
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
says that all unorganized sector people

497
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
have to get themselves onto this

498
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
database with a whole range of

499
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,520
information including the tax

500
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
information and

501
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,120
you know the id information and the

502
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
telephone number and all the rest of it

503
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
if they are to get anything at all if

504
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
the state at any time decides that they

505
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
want to help them through a time of

506
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
distress

507
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
so this is just a continued distress has

508
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,320
provided an opportunity to speed these

509
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
things up and to use more coercion

510
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
and to threaten exclusion but this is a

511
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,360
pattern that we've been seeing over the

512
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,480
past

513
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
past 10 years

514
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
just two things that were that seemed

515
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
pretty interesting one is that you know

516
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,600
we have this id system the uid system

517
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,280
which was done

518
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,400
like a

519
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
joint kind of thing between private

520
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
industry by bringing in a marketing

521
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
honcho from within

522
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
tech industry and the government and

523
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
they

524
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,679
the whole project was run through this

525
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
now it's about 11 years 12 yeah it's

526
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,799
about 12 years since the project began

527
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
and they had in november

528
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
a meeting where

529
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
two of the guys who are i mean all of

530
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
them spoke but in one session which was

531
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,559
on digital economy

532
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,520
you had

533
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,440
the two people who were from government

534
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
and who had worked on this id project

535
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,799
speaking there and saying

536
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,919
that

537
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
this project had actually been promoted

538
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
saying that this is so that the poor can

539
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
have an identity and they should be able

540
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
to get their whatever they've been you

541
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
know whatever is due to them

542
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
so you have them now saying that listen

543
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,720
this was never about the state it was

544
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
never for the government

545
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
it was for creating a digital economy

546
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
and it's got hijacked by the state and

547
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
they are holding it captive

548
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,280
so there is a there is a way in which

549
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
they saying that the state's job was

550
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
just to create these databases so that

551
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
we can create businesses out of it so

552
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
that the general gdp will go up and this

553
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
is not the first time they are doing it

554
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
this it happened earlier when they said

555
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,559
that privacy is not a fundamental right

556
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
it's not a right at all

557
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,000
because if it's going to be a right it's

558
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
going to be a problem

559
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,679
so just uh one

560
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,200
uh

561
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
one thing therefore is that the i think

562
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,520
the place where we are seeing

563
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,360
a large number of players come in and

564
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
there is a certain amount of anxiety

565
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,799
which we can see around us now

566
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,799
apart from the fact of being in all

567
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
these various databases and having to

568
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
identify yourself through them and be

569
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
watched by somebody else who you don't

570
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,840
know

571
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
apart from all of that the fintech

572
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,080
explosion particularly

573
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
is causing an enormous amount of anxiety

574
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,799
because various people are getting onto

575
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
it i mean we tech people are getting on

576
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
to the fintech revolution which

577
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
basically they're looking at banks and

578
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,919
their legacy data and wanting to use the

579
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
data and make what they believe it

580
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,120
they've created a

581
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
money movement

582
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,720
agency which is outside of government

583
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
and outside most regulations so that and

584
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
the government has been

585
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
the prime mover i mean the prime

586
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,159
marketer of that and the prime minister

587
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,080
has been the prime marketer

588
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
so

589
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,679
and in this in each of these especially

590
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
in the fintech sector you find that

591
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,039
amazon and google and facebook and

592
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,720
everybody has walked in

593
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,679
so while the intention apparently is to

594
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,080
say that you know we need our own we

595
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
need to make our own businesses and we

596
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:04,960
can't

597
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
rely on advertising because we don't

598
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,799
have that kind of budgets here

599
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,880
but we do need all these databases and

600
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,640
they should be ours which means the

601
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
indian tech interest

602
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,080
ours is not the people of india and is

603
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
the indian tech interest and therefore

604
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
you know we need to fight off all these

605
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,080
amazons and googles and whoever else

606
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
actually they're creating you know

607
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,000
various scenarios where those guys come

608
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
and do the

609
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,039
major part of the business

610
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,039
so this is the kind of semi-complex

611
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,720
scene that we are in now and i'm not

612
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,640
sure if this is what you meant but this

613
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
is i think obsessing my head so i just

614
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
said it

615
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,559
thanks a lot i think i i i think you

616
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
also raise a question and and and maybe

617
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,880
aaron you can come in here but about how

618
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
useful uh the idea of sectors is to

619
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,640
think about uh transgressions as you say

620
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,120
so maybe that's one thing aaron that you

621
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
can begin with but also the second

622
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
aspect that you raise about about the

623
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,120
question of state capture

624
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,039
and the capture of state institutions

625
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,480
and what this actually means for the

626
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,159
dependency of

627
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
of of the public sector

628
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
um aaron perhaps if you could share from

629
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,440
uh

630
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
from the work that is being done in the

631
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,840
eu if if you see similar questions in

632
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,520
margin sure

633
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,919
thank you siddharth can you hear me

634
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,799
yeah

635
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,880
no so it's actually a great time for me

636
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
to sort of react to the conversation so

637
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
far and indeed one of the questions

638
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
we're grappling with in the eu focus

639
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
component of the of the research is

640
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
whether it still makes sense to talk

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
about the tech sector as a sort of

642
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
distinct area

643
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
of innovation um

644
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
sort of business growth

645
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
weather you know over the past sort of

646
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
ten years and in particular during the

647
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,679
pandemic uh we've seen the sort of tech

648
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,760
sector invade pretty much any every

649
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,039
other sector

650
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
um that matters uh especially from a

651
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
regulatory perspective and i don't think

652
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
we've sort of come to a sort of final

653
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,840
answer on this we're still debating

654
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,200
internally whether

655
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
um

656
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
there's value and still

657
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
holding on to this notion of a

658
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,320
distinct tech sector in particular

659
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,279
because

660
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
um at least for me at least i have a

661
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,559
fear that one when we kind of say that

662
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,000
the tech sector is everywhere that the

663
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,679
amazons of the world that the googles of

664
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
the world are basically like uh they're

665
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
no longer tech firms that they're sort

666
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
of you know um

667
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
these these monsters that that operate

668
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
across sectors that we we kind of lose

669
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,440
side we can can can can sort of sharpen

670
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
our our hooks in terms of regulation um

671
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,600
there's a lot of regulatory activity in

672
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
europe in particular around as we

673
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,159
discussed today digital services digital

674
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,360
markets

675
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
the governance of data of different

676
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,080
kinds

677
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
and i think it helps at the starting

678
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
point for a lot of those conversations

679
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,120
is this collective understanding that

680
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
that the tech sector is a thing right

681
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,799
that it's not uh that it's not a sort of

682
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,080
uh a figment of of of the past um and

683
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,000
that we can identify actors within

684
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,360
both the sort of regulatory community

685
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
but i think more broadly civil society

686
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,360
that can uh help to rein in uh

687
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,760
particularly transgressive behavior by

688
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
by tech companies right even though they

689
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,880
operate in for example finance um

690
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,159
education

691
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
agriculture increasingly and so forth so

692
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,799
um i think this notion of you know

693
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,799
what is the tech sector still and does

694
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,320
it make sense to

695
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,799
um to conceive of some of these issues

696
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,200
as being sort of tech driven uh is an

697
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
important one but also want to react to

698
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
something that mariana said and i think

699
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
this is where this question of sort of

700
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,400
what can be done and what's the role of

701
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,720
sort of civil society and other

702
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,159
actors is quite important so she

703
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,279
mentioned that

704
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,000
in brazil a lot of the innovation during

705
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,279
the pandemic

706
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,760
um was by sort of firms uh

707
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,679
using sort of chinese sort of

708
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
innovations of different kinds and i

709
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,200
find this sort of this question of like

710
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
the the geopolitical interests

711
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,919
um and and sort of suspicions or

712
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,960
concerns around uh the

713
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
sort of the

714
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
national homes of certain tech companies

715
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,039
important because at least in europe we

716
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,880
see that there's still this push against

717
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
american and silicon valley in

718
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
particular uh

719
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,320
interests although the problems are much

720
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
broader but i think elsewhere in the

721
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
world there is this concern around china

722
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,440
india as well um and i think where

723
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
where we can use some of those um

724
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,919
national interests or or concerns around

725
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,159
the geopolitics of technology in order

726
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,520
to resist this the sort of expansion of

727
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,480
um

728
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
dare i say illegitimate technology or or

729
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
technology that perhaps uh has been

730
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,440
developed

731
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
a vacuum

732
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
during during the pandemic um where

733
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,440
perhaps you know we haven't

734
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
uh followed all the procurement

735
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
procedures for different reasons where

736
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,080
we still have an answer to some

737
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,000
questions around accountability

738
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
um

739
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
exclusion

740
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
so forth it's sometimes nice to have the

741
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,960
geopolitical card to play right where we

742
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
can at least use that as a way to to

743
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,799
push back certain kinds of

744
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,159
um behavior by by the sector as it were

745
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,000
and just one final point if i may said

746
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,279
arts

747
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,960
this um this question of no cost

748
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,720
contracts i think is really

749
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
just a brazilian phenomenon it's

750
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
something we've seen in europe as well

751
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
um and this is actually where it becomes

752
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
a lot harder to understand what's

753
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,320
happening

754
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,840
in terms of government procurement of

755
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
systems because

756
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,159
uh

757
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,600
at least when you know there's

758
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
contracting in place where governments

759
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,919
are paying for for systems and services

760
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,760
we have the paper trail we have the the

761
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
due diligence that's required um for for

762
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,159
government spend and where things are

763
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,679
being offered for free we see this a lot

764
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,520
in the humanitarian sector as well that

765
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,640
makes it much harder to understand um

766
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,399
you know the sort of the the terms of

767
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
agreements uh there's a lot of see

768
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,120
because things are offered for free um

769
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
and i'm i'm sort of hoping that we can

770
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,600
think further about what does it mean to

771
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
offer sort of a

772
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,039
a platform or a stage uh during an

773
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
emergency context in an emergency

774
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,159
context rather

775
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,399
even for a temporary period uh at no

776
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,360
cost

777
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,520
and then you know what what that sort of

778
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,720
allows for

779
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,760
push back

780
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,919
um transparency

781
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,320
uh and resistance uh by by range of

782
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
actors so i hope that helps in terms of

783
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,440
reaction to the points made so far

784
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,919
thanks aaron and and scott maybe i'd

785
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,000
like to bring you here to also react to

786
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,840
a point that aaron made towards the end

787
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
of this idea of of illegitimate

788
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,000
technology uh whether it's to do with

789
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,679
questions of procurement whether it's to

790
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,679
do with the ways in which uh

791
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,200
accountability is sort of these

792
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
organizations and i was wondering in in

793
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,960
your uh reflections on on on tech

794
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,760
expansion during the pandemic um how

795
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,640
would you sort of distinguish

796
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
transgressions from from from from

797
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,960
innovative activities from business as

798
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
usual and what is an effective counter

799
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,760
to this understanding that that the ways

800
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
in which

801
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,840
text

802
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,600
companies are actually moving into new

803
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
areas of business is is part and parcel

804
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
of their business model

805
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,279
uh thanks thanks so much uh

806
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
siddhartha and thanks to to everybody um

807
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,440
it's really uh great to be part of this

808
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,200
conversation and i believe we're on at

809
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,640
least four different continents at the

810
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,159
moment which is uh

811
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,120
um

812
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,440
which is pretty exciting uh

813
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
um

814
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,480
i i the the conversation's really

815
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,750
interesting i think i think that my um

816
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,159
[Music]

817
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,240
my initial reactions and this is not to

818
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,760
suggest that that government

819
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,399
surveillance is indeed um

820
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,320
better than this privatized capitalist

821
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
surveillance that we're seeing um grow

822
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
with and accelerate because of the

823
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,279
conditions of the pandemic but i do

824
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,240
think that one background condition um

825
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,840
that has enabled this

826
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,960
uh

827
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
privatized um surveillance creep or

828
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,600
transgressions is is the the

829
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,960
is the the norm of neoliberalism and the

830
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,919
the the failure of uh um

831
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,480
governments to be in the business of

832
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,600
providing services anymore and so i i

833
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
think that that background condition is

834
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
one that we need to

835
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
bear in mind because it is the one you

836
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
know

837
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,240
all of these different examples and

838
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
there are some really good ones

839
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,559
are enabled by the the failure of

840
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,240
government uh to to do its job edtech is

841
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,679
a good example

842
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
schools do not have the resources to

843
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,559
serve children so google comes in and

844
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
says here's a chromebook you know and

845
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,919
and

846
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,000
and and start surveilling our our

847
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
children um

848
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
and this is true in any of the exam any

849
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,919
of the you know if we're talking about

850
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,559
contract tracing whatever um

851
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
it's the failure of government

852
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
which has been primed

853
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,240
which which

854
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,559
exists in part because of the tech

855
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,919
company's ethos of deregulation of

856
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,520
privatization not just tech companies

857
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,919
but obviously corporations across the

858
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,519
board that has

859
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,919
created uh this this gap in governance

860
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,880
and services which is in turn um allow

861
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,600
these transgressions uh to accelerate

862
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,880
with uh

863
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,760
you know dramatic fashion um

864
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,840
and so i think that that is important

865
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,399
which is you know i i think we have to

866
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,600
attack these uh you know attack but um

867
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,559
call out and and combat these symptoms

868
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,480
but i do think it's important to to to

869
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,760
realize this is part of a broader

870
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,679
phenomenon of

871
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,640
neoliberalism and privatization um and i

872
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
think this relates very closely and and

873
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,039
and is potentially you know one

874
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,279
solution

875
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,279
building off of um aaron's point about

876
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,559
geopolitics and i think we have to be

877
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,080
careful here not to be

878
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
i'm not suggesting this is where aaron

879
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,399
was headed but but be careful not to be

880
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
you know sort of nativist in our

881
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,519
approach to

882
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,519
to these discussions but at the same

883
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,360
time to the extent that there is an

884
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,000
opportunity to suggest to countries okay

885
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,799
if you care about your sovereignty right

886
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,600
then one way in which to protect that

887
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,320
sovereignty is to be in the position in

888
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,519
the business of providing um government

889
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,679
services yourself so that when there is

890
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,240
a crisis you do not have to depend on

891
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
either

892
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360
private or public goods from uh another

893
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,399
country um whether whether that be you

894
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,159
know

895
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,519
my you know

896
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,760
my neighbors to the west in in silicon

897
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,159
valley or um uh uh china um

898
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,919
and so i think that that's that's a

899
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,559
potential uh uh you know

900
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,279
helpful linking of those um

901
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,200
issues so

902
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
those are sort of my initial uh thoughts

903
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,840
um

904
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,559
i i do think the concept is

905
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,960
is really helpful from a descriptive

906
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,799
standpoint

907
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
to help understand

908
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,559
the degree to which um

909
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,200
you know companies and and again to

910
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,640
other people's points not just tech

911
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,200
companies but many companies now are

912
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,320
surveillance capitalists and um the the

913
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,960
commodity is um

914
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,279
information and surveillance i would i

915
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,840
in terms of you know shaping norms right

916
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,279
we've allowed ourselves to be shaped by

917
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,240
some of these companies

918
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,799
and and i think we need to

919
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,720
resist some of the nomenclature that

920
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,600
they've imposed on us um at turns and so

921
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
even you know the idea that these are no

922
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
cost no cost contracts or free it is

923
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,440
just it's just inaccurate from from a

924
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,000
descriptive standpoint like that

925
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,840
you know the old saying is nothing in

926
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,919
life is free right and it's not free

927
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
right there's a huge cost and so i think

928
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,679
we need to um

929
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,559
be sure when we're labeling them to say

930
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,159
you know they're they're the ones that

931
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,919
want this right and that's because they

932
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,120
are

933
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,399
um extraction in industries extracting

934
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,799
information and um

935
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,679
so what what do they need to provide in

936
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,760
exchange for that um extraction um

937
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,440
so those are my initial thoughts but i

938
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
really i'm really happy to be part of

939
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,960
the conversation and look forward to

940
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,280
learning more thank you

941
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,679
thanks a lot uh scott um mariana if i

942
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,839
can bring you back into the conversation

943
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,879
and

944
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,599
maybe to also speak to the to to one of

945
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,440
the points that that's got made in terms

946
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
of of thinking about institutional and

947
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,960
public sector responses particularly as

948
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,719
as he describes when when when

949
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,359
government capacity is is

950
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,839
is is non-existent in in in certain

951
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,480
domains uh in in in brazil and in the

952
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,520
work that that that you're doing

953
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,679
what role do you see

954
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,879
for us for civil society and for for

955
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,960
regulators to be able to

956
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,040
to respond both it and in times of a

957
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,599
pandemic but also uh in terms of a

958
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
longer or

959
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,280
a longer sort of more embedded response

960
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
to the fact that institutional

961
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,560
capacities need to be strengthened

962
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,079
thanks um

963
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,359
okay so

964
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,240
lots of things that i want to react to

965
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,920
and i will try

966
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,880
uh to do my best

967
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,200
i think this this issue of uh the

968
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,839
public sector um inability or lack of

969
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,119
resource

970
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,760
to provide i'm sorry there's a noise

971
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
here please let me know if you can hear

972
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,200
me i will

973
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
try to move closer

974
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
and

975
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,200
there is the this issue in brazil now

976
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,839
that um the government is active

977
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,839
actively trying to

978
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,160
kill the population so

979
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,040
it's not just the lack of resource or

980
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,359
lack of capacity there's also a

981
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,000
political project and the pandemic

982
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,359
showed how

983
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,040
the government was actually trying to

984
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
divert attention and to not

985
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,800
uh

986
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,720
act in any

987
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
reasonable way

988
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,000
so it's kind of hard like right now

989
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,760
to understand how all these um

990
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
many um

991
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,520
issues play out but

992
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,359
what i was i think going to say and like

993
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,359
kind of trying to answer your question

994
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,359
about civil society

995
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,960
um the main problem the main um

996
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,839
limits the main difficulty that we faced

997
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,839
with this research was

998
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,440
a transparency one both public and

999
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,160
private transparency because we were

1000
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,359
researching um

1001
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
technologies that had been acquired

1002
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,920
by governments and that even though we

1003
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
are in a pandemic and there have been

1004
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
some um there is some level of

1005
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,960
flexibilization in terms of

1006
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,839
um

1007
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,200
the the

1008
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,160
public procurement uh

1009
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,040
the the the thing is that after

1010
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,000
a year of research and over

1011
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,440
600 uh freedom of information

1012
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,680
act requests and lots of other um

1013
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,480
attempts to gather information

1014
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
and together uh

1015
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,440
these contracts disagreements at the end

1016
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,079
we were able to um

1017
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,680
acquire only half of all the

1018
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,079
the initiatives that we know that took

1019
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,200
place because there there was uh talk in

1020
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,680
the media or even by government

1021
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,760
officials but we were never able to

1022
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,800
locate

1023
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
uh the

1024
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,040
so it's not just the no cost

1025
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,160
uh issue and the inability to

1026
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,839
have this paper trail but like we

1027
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,960
it's it's before we couldn't even access

1028
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,520
like the basic um outline of the of this

1029
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,000
agreements and this is a huge problem

1030
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,079
because we can't say that it's something

1031
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
that the private sector is uh

1032
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,320
responsible for or or the public sector

1033
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,960
is re actually the public sector is

1034
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
responsible for in this case um and so

1035
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,400
what we what we thought was more um

1036
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,960
useful and perhaps as a strategy to

1037
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
engage civil society and other

1038
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,839
organizations around this issue was to

1039
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,000
talk about transparency

1040
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
because uh

1041
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,160
people were more um

1042
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,040
impressed and and the impact was a

1043
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,359
greater when we said look we know their

1044
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
things are happening but we don't know

1045
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,880
exactly

1046
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,000
what they are because we can have access

1047
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
to like

1048
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,000
like the basics something that should be

1049
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,200
public and we can't access that and this

1050
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,599
has garnered more attention and then we

1051
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,839
were able to go further into the

1052
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,280
discussions of

1053
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,320
um

1054
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
of the the actual numbers and the

1055
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,960
sectors that are involved and issues of

1056
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,760
privacy data protection surveillance we

1057
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,920
started with the transparency thing

1058
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
because this is something that brazilian

1059
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,200
civil society

1060
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,320
in the

1061
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,520
last i don't know 10 years maybe has

1062
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,320
been

1063
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,839
very um

1064
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,240
has been following very closely

1065
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
so i don't know this is just an example

1066
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,119
of something that we use to

1067
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,320
garner attention and to engage people uh

1068
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,720
around this subject because

1069
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,320
like in a scenario in brazil where

1070
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,280
civil society is faced with and

1071
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,920
not just brazil everywhere but with so

1072
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,880
many

1073
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,839
problems and the government itself is

1074
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,240
always trying to divert attention and

1075
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,119
show

1076
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,160
it's very hard sometimes to

1077
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,960
make people care about these things

1078
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,520
especially when there's this um

1079
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,160
framing of um

1080
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,480
innovation and of something that can

1081
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
actually be good and people don't

1082
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,319
understand the implications

1083
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:09,119
so

1084
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,280
i don't know i i just thought it would

1085
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,119
be useful to bring this experience to

1086
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,440
the table and

1087
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,160
uh but it's something that is very uh we

1088
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
still have a lot of work to do

1089
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,359
so thanks this is really helpful both in

1090
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,200
terms of how you articulate the

1091
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
challenges of actually trying to do a

1092
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
monitoring and

1093
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,079
uh

1094
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,480
accounting off of government and

1095
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,319
government in departments but also the

1096
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,680
framing of

1097
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,119
of such responses in terms of

1098
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,400
transparency

1099
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,800
uh in order to build solidarity amongst

1100
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
different organizations

1101
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
would this be something that you also

1102
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,319
see

1103
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,440
in terms of civil society responses or

1104
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,960
have there been other ways in which

1105
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
civil society responses have been framed

1106
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
in response to

1107
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,420
tech expansionism

1108
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,599
[Music]

1109
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,200
yeah so um i can recognize the problem

1110
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,440
of opacity as something that we also see

1111
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,359
in our research so

1112
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,000
yeah advocating for transparency and

1113
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,319
making sure that the problem is there to

1114
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,839
the public eye

1115
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
is important so i'll talk as a

1116
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,920
researcher on academic i think also

1117
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,480
extending the scope and making it global

1118
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,880
and going beyond fragments of privacy

1119
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,640
and ethics can also help in this

1120
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,040
scenario because it allows us to make

1121
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,079
visible these other actors and also

1122
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,480
identify when we can take actionable

1123
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,000
tasks and i think

1124
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
another thing because this sector

1125
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,079
transgression happened in the in the

1126
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
perceived emergency and

1127
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,480
uh they they they

1128
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,079
rise from a pandemic we could also um

1129
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,079
pay attention to where this rhetoric has

1130
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
been used before so in um

1131
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,640
yeah in regions where digital

1132
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
humanitarians and flourish so zones of

1133
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,359
conflict places that are considered as

1134
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,359
perhaps economically or politically

1135
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,800
unstable or

1136
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
border zones and then we can learn from

1137
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,760
uh grassroots movements there on how

1138
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,160
they were directly impacted by these

1139
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,119
transgressive uh technologies

1140
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
and uh learn from their experience and

1141
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,920
see how perhaps they resisted or

1142
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,079
subverted um

1143
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,800
subverted these trends and i think this

1144
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,240
is particularly important because we i

1145
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,599
feel like we're going to be heading

1146
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,000
toward a lot of other emergencies and

1147
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,760
with the with the with the with the

1148
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,520
problems that we will be facing with

1149
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
climate change so i think

1150
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,520
to have a more robust institutional

1151
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,839
response is to also listen to to

1152
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,480
grassroots movement and learn from from

1153
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,480
their activities yeah

1154
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,880
thank you uh usha you want to also come

1155
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,079
in here and

1156
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,640
on the point of civil society responses

1157
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,680
both in terms of challenges of of of how

1158
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,760
to respond and also what possible

1159
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,720
framings could be

1160
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,680
yeah

1161
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,920
it's actually a little complex here i

1162
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
think i mean differently complex it's

1163
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,000
not any more or less complex it's

1164
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,880
terribly complex everywhere but

1165
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,400
i think it's a little different in the

1166
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,000
sense that

1167
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,319
when we address

1168
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,520
the tech issues here we are addressing

1169
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
the state much more than we are

1170
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
addressing the companies

1171
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,240
because the companies are acting through

1172
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,760
the state

1173
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,280
and the

1174
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,079
what the these the obvious surveillance

1175
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,839
is being done by the state with the help

1176
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,119
of these

1177
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,640
technology companies and i was thinking

1178
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,400
when you know on the question of

1179
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,160
sovereignty for instance i think our and

1180
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,000
you said this

1181
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,440
i was thinking that actually it's very

1182
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,520
difficult here because you know even in

1183
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,400
our

1184
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,319
even in some of the major state projects

1185
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,760
that they have which is which are

1186
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,280
surveillance projects

1187
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
they're not able to find the state is

1188
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
not able to find

1189
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,119
uh people who will join the state i mean

1190
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,920
join a take up a job with the state

1191
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
to

1192
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,040
for instance be a security officer who

1193
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,640
will make sure that data security is

1194
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,359
maintained so they have to then

1195
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,599
you know give this work out it's all

1196
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,520
about startup

1197
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,720
and

1198
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,240
you know giving the work out to

1199
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,599
everybody else

1200
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,720
so it's not about establishing systems

1201
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
as much as being opportunistic and

1202
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,720
that's the way we are now so the

1203
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
the way to do it is

1204
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
in a short time get as much as you can

1205
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,119
put it all together because the

1206
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,040
unfortunately it's like a

1207
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,560
rush to the bottom

1208
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,480
so it's also saying it's also a

1209
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,400
competition with the really bad guys i

1210
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,480
mean you're talking about training in

1211
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
the power of all these big corporations

1212
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,400
and if you're competing to say okay i

1213
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,920
can't have that kind of power so i'll

1214
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,680
find another kind of power that will

1215
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,119
compete with

1216
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,359
with this power then you know it's so

1217
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,440
for civil society the

1218
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
uh when you're addressing the state and

1219
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,640
the state doesn't listen and the state

1220
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,119
has the power to coerce to mandate to do

1221
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,040
whatever it wants it's one kind of

1222
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,319
problem that we are faced with but i

1223
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,560
think the good thing that i'm seeing now

1224
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,960
and i think i hear it in many of the

1225
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,040
meetings is that there is a greater

1226
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,240
awareness

1227
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,640
that these are problems earlier it was

1228
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,240
you know seeing tech as a problem

1229
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,280
because it seemed so obscure

1230
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,599
it was hidden it wasn't that clear but

1231
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
increasingly we are hearing people

1232
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,280
saying listen we do need to do you know

1233
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,040
we can't just walk into this with our

1234
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,160
eyes shut

1235
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,680
so that's been one good thing and then

1236
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,599
there are groups that have formed over

1237
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,400
this you know over the past 10 years

1238
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,200
which are making legal cases out of many

1239
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,760
of these and they are really working at

1240
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,480
uh pushing back they're working at uh

1241
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,920
you know getting

1242
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
the courts and judges to understand and

1243
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,800
that's a huge problem because you know

1244
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,720
we go through so many discussions to

1245
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,640
understand what we are

1246
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,800
faced with and judges just have to hear

1247
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,560
it from lawyers who themselves have no

1248
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
clue and you have to be training them on

1249
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,520
you know what needs to be so it's a real

1250
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,560
uh

1251
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,480
it's not a happy place to be but

1252
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,240
people are working at it and lawyers are

1253
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,520
getting trained in understanding

1254
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,599
technology the younger lord

1255
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,119
and that's a huge help so there's more

1256
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,400
discussion

1257
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,760
but uh

1258
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,200
the unfortunate thing and i think

1259
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,800
sometimes we might need to make this

1260
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,640
linked to and i mean i'm sure we have it

1261
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,280
i'm saying that between philanthropy

1262
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,200
you know who are the richest guys today

1263
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,800
who is giving the money and what are

1264
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
they giving the money for and what what

1265
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
do they ask in return

1266
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,040
i think that's clearing the pitch quite

1267
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,400
a lot and i think we you know we need to

1268
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,319
figure out what to do about that because

1269
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,319
if you look there is a recent article

1270
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,240
where

1271
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,160
the chap has written about

1272
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,440
all the things that have happened on

1273
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
this india stack kind of thing which is

1274
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,040
what all these applications are that are

1275
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,359
being created all of them all of them

1276
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,920
are being done by a tech baron who's got

1277
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,000
pots of money and who's therefore

1278
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,599
get you know getting people on to do

1279
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
this create all these products and then

1280
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,480
he has access to the state and he what

1281
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,560
his in his language he evangelizes it to

1282
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,920
the state

1283
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,640
so

1284
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,640
then we are stuck with

1285
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,680
you know

1286
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,839
and there is a huge crackdown in india

1287
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,560
on people getting funds

1288
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,119
so it's like it's a lot of things coming

1289
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,880
together therefore when you say trans

1290
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,359
you know in intersector when it's really

1291
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,640
like superbly intersect

1292
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,280
so one last one word if i my just as a

1293
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,720
thing because i'm very curious about

1294
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
this thing of innovation

1295
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,800
and the idea that

1296
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,040
you know we are all

1297
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,000
rights activists in in many ways

1298
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,680
but the idea that therefore the

1299
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,760
corporate entity should have more rights

1300
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,280
than all of us should have and that they

1301
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,680
will have the right not just to innovate

1302
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,240
but to roll it out in our midst without

1303
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,680
any kind of

1304
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,079
uh you know without

1305
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,920
asking us without

1306
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,160
you know figuring out how it matters no

1307
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,040
moratorium no licensing no nothing

1308
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,400
anything goes

1309
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,480
i think this uh

1310
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,520
you know i idealizing of

1311
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,400
innovation maybe we need to

1312
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,240
juggle that a bit and see what it really

1313
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,240
means

1314
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,860
it's not the individual it's about power

1315
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,640
[Music]

1316
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
thanks thanks for bringing that point up

1317
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,480
and maybe this is something that scott

1318
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,839
you'd like to respond to and the

1319
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,040
question of

1320
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,119
of innovation as power and it was it

1321
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,800
also links to the questions that you

1322
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,400
spoke of before about government

1323
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,040
capacity

1324
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,640
well thanks yeah i think it's a really

1325
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,440
important point um

1326
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,200
and i

1327
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,439
i

1328
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,480
i i do think that there is an inertia

1329
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,800
um

1330
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,160
both rhetorically and and in terms of um

1331
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,280
all sorts of structures in in favor

1332
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,319
that

1333
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,200
compel innovation uh sometimes for the

1334
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,839
sake of innovation without um any sort

1335
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,079
of uh deliberation

1336
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:58,880
um

1337
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,200
or democratic input on

1338
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,040
um

1339
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,640
on whether that innovation is harmful or

1340
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,400
not um

1341
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,440
the the as issue was was talking the key

1342
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,359
example that came to my mind from the

1343
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,200
american context was

1344
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,640
the rapid

1345
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,280
proliferation of um policeworn body

1346
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,800
cameras that we've seen in the united

1347
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,400
states over just a really short period

1348
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,880
of time

1349
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,839
and right and in that

1350
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,680
context you know civil rights groups are

1351
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,760
are are not of one mind on whether or

1352
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,440
not this is a

1353
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,760
a an important check on

1354
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,960
um

1355
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,000
uh

1356
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,240
you know

1357
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,920
state power and racism or or not

1358
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,960
but um what we've seen is

1359
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,800
you know

1360
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,280
pilot programs um

1361
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,680
and uh you know they're sort of rolled

1362
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,200
out

1363
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,319
in fast

1364
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,040
at a fast pace um sometimes civil

1365
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,240
society is galvanized to work with the

1366
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,280
state um to legitimize that

1367
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,480
um

1368
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,440
and

1369
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,800
um you know the the response is is bit

1370
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,599
more nuanced than the state uh might

1371
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,359
lead us to believe in so one example is

1372
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,440
that in new york city where the when

1373
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,359
they were um

1374
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,119
a few years ago rolling out their body

1375
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,680
camera

1376
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,920
pilot program which of course is is is a

1377
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,520
product of

1378
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,680
partnering with the private sector and

1379
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,520
companies like palantir and

1380
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,599
axios

1381
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,680
they they surveyed a bunch of new

1382
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,319
yorkers and you know the new yorkers

1383
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,720
including new yorkers from from diverse

1384
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,680
uh backgrounds and their their responses

1385
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,720
to

1386
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,400
you know the conditions under which this

1387
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,440
technology should be uh deployed we're

1388
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
were very nuanced right you know they

1389
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,559
had strong views about um when the

1390
00:50:58,559 --> 00:50:59,920
cameras should be

1391
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,040
activated and when not and access to uh

1392
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,280
the videos after the fact and who who

1393
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,040
you know when officers should be able to

1394
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,280
review the uh videos um and so it wasn't

1395
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,839
a sort of blank check right that the the

1396
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,800
civil society and the public gave to the

1397
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,480
deployment of this

1398
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
this innovation

1399
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,960
but new york city ran with the top-line

1400
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,440
response which was uh you know people

1401
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,880
approve of body cameras okay

1402
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,559
the conditions under which they approved

1403
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,079
of them were extremely multi-faceted

1404
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,839
and the conditions in under which new

1405
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,400
york city deployed them were not

1406
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,960
in alignment with those nuanced

1407
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,839
perspectives right and so the top line

1408
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,880
was taken legitimized the innovation and

1409
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,280
then the innovation was deployed and now

1410
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,359
of course you know are there examples

1411
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,920
where police body cameras have um

1412
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,319
captured police brutality

1413
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:00,400
and um been used to uh you know at least

1414
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,200
momentarily garner some measure of

1415
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,000
accountability for individual officers

1416
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,319
yes there are examples of that are there

1417
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,400
also examples where this is

1418
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,200
being used as a as a you know

1419
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,760
innovative surveillance tool which is

1420
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,440
further subjugating marginalized

1421
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,400
communities

1422
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,440
of course

1423
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,599
and so um you know i think sometimes the

1424
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,680
unit we see the innovation as a quick

1425
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,440
fix to the problem oh

1426
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
how do we deal with police brutality

1427
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,040
well let's get this video camera out

1428
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,880
well the background question is we have

1429
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,520
structural racism oppression and a video

1430
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,040
camera is not going to fix those

1431
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,839
conditions right but we we just latch on

1432
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,960
to the innovation as usual suggestion

1433
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,720
uh suggesting as as a quick fix to

1434
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,040
long-standing structural problems and

1435
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,920
then we use

1436
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,800
civil society and you know quick

1437
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,920
basically crowdsourcing of public input

1438
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,319
to legitimize that innovation when in

1439
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,480
reality the public response to that

1440
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,200
innovation is is far more complex

1441
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,799
than than we may be led to believe

1442
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,440
thanks a lot scott i think those

1443
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,839
examples are uh are really compelling

1444
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,920
also to sort of problematize this whole

1445
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,480
idea of of innovation since we're almost

1446
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,079
at time uh i'd like to do a one round of

1447
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,280
uh

1448
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
final reactions uh from our panel and

1449
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,559
maybe i can start with you aaron

1450
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,400
thank you siddharth and just to to

1451
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
reiterate scott's points uh around sort

1452
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,880
of the

1453
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,760
um

1454
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,000
this this idea that sort of text will

1455
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,839
tech will solve all of our problems i

1456
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,040
agree 100

1457
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,880
i mean i think we all agree here that

1458
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
it's uh it's quite easy and dare i say

1459
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
lazy sometimes to rely on technology or

1460
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,359
to expect technology to

1461
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,559
solve deep or structural uh problems i

1462
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,280
mean his previous point around um the

1463
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
context in which you know some of these

1464
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,119
uh sort of pandemic related technologies

1465
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,440
were being deployed in the u.s

1466
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,240
um really points to like for example the

1467
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,280
need to

1468
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,160
to address tax policy right like and to

1469
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,520
to ask hard questions about the

1470
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,839
availability of public sector funding to

1471
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,640
uh

1472
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,839
to to respond to emergencies like uh

1473
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,240
coped 19 but of course those are

1474
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,480
uh not only harder sort of uh problems

1475
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,400
to solve but i dare say sort of

1476
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,960
politicize in in different ways um and

1477
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,400
so technology certainly isn't the

1478
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,960
solution to most of our problems if any

1479
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,359
of them i will also just sort of uh

1480
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,599
close by reflecting on

1481
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,839
i think

1482
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,599
related to the politics of this question

1483
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,839
of innovation and resistance innovation

1484
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,000
uh in the context of the pandemic i'm

1485
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,839
reminded that we often find ourselves

1486
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,559
among strange bedfellows uh just last

1487
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,520
weekend

1488
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,319
was a big protest in brussels against uh

1489
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,079
in particular sort of use of digital

1490
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,520
vaccination

1491
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,880
certificates

1492
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,440
for accessing restaurants and and bars

1493
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,599
and so forth and while i think many of

1494
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,359
us here would probably have you know

1495
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,799
questions around for example um

1496
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:07,760
the

1497
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,359
sort of legitimacy of certain

1498
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,160
technological interventions uh questions

1499
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,920
of you know the sort of the providers of

1500
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,599
the the platforms that are being used

1501
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,000
for vaccination certificates in

1502
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,720
different countries um

1503
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,200
i imagine most of so generally be sort

1504
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,240
of um in favor of the use of you know

1505
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,640
certain sorts of technological measures

1506
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,880
to manage public health uh to reduce

1507
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,440
risk of coronavirus et cetera so i think

1508
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,799
it's it's uh

1509
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,559
what i'm trying to say is it's it's not

1510
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,319
that we're anti-tech or anti-innovation

1511
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,240
in our line of thinking in this project

1512
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,160
but we're asking questions about

1513
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,640
you know when does innovation become it

1514
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,720
and what makes a technological

1515
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,799
innovation in particular one

1516
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,720
that's provided exclusively by the

1517
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,599
private sector uh legitimate or not um

1518
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,960
so i hope that's helpful thank you very

1519

like to

1522
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,280
add some concluding thoughts

1523
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
yes so i think i would just like to

1524
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,200
thank you all and say that

1525
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,240
in one hour i have a lot of questions

1526
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,520
and

1527
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
a lot of

1528
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,319
things that uh i want to reflect on and

1529
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,559
also at the privacy brazil we will keep

1530
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,880
working on them and we hope that we will

1531
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,319
be able to

1532
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:29,440
continue this conversation for example

1533
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,559
on the

1534
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,559
um

1535
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,680
on whether we should um make this this

1536
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,400
distinction of the tech sector i think

1537
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,599
this is

1538
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,000
a very hard question that made me think

1539
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,160
a lot during the webinar and i have some

1540
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,240
thoughts on that and i think we at data

1541
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,400
privacy as well uh considering the

1542
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
brazilian scenario and we would of

1543
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,839
course like to continue this

1544
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,160
conversation thank you very much

1545
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,480
to all

1546
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,720
what's done

1547
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,920
so some concluding remarks i wanna well

1548
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,599
i wanna thank you for this insightful

1549
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,920
conversation i think this made us all

1550
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,680
reflect on

1551
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,079
um what was known as perhaps techno

1552
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,640
solutionism and how it progressed and

1553
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,359
how we we see this you know tech firms

1554
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,640
gaining more

1555
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,040
power and control here and

1556
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,000
and yeah i'm looking forward to to

1557
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
to carrying on this conversation with

1558
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,119
you all thanks

1559
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,480
thank you uh russia would you like to go

1560
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,799
next

1561
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,200
just two things if i can come back to

1562
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,920
one is like is a kind of response to

1563
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,520
what adam said

1564
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,040
uh on the

1565
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,440
on this uh vaccination

1566
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,040
uh database

1567
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,960
i actually have not defensive at all

1568
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,799
about opposing a global database on

1569
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,960
vaccination and asking that we should be

1570
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,880
showing this wherever we go

1571
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,599
because i don't see the agenda as being

1572
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,160
vaccination and health safety at all

1573
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,240
i think it's an opportunity that's being

1574
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,760
created because actually we don't know

1575
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,119
enough about the virus we don't know

1576
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,400
enough about the vaccination i think

1577
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,240
science should focus on that

1578
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,920
and not allow

1579
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,240
tech czars to want us on

1580
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,880
a global database and i mean i can give

1581
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,200
you illustrations earlier of how they've

1582
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,359
actually spoken about this ambition of

1583
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,359
having everyone on the global database i

1584
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,280
really think i mean i'm really not

1585
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,200
defensive at all about it i think

1586
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,160
such a database should not exist

1587
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,559
and the second slight thing is that it's

1588
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,400
on disruption

1589
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,480
uh it's actually quite interesting to

1590
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,000
see what happens here you know

1591
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,359
disruption

1592
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,559
was meant to disrupt morrigan systems

1593
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,720
but they've actually become like burning

1594
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,720
the boats so you burn your boat so that

1595
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,319
you have to get on to the system that i

1596
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,000
am providing for you now whether it

1597
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,839
works for you or not and whether it

1598
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,160
destroys all your rights or not so i

1599
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,640
think the just like we interrogate the

1600
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,400
idea of innovation maybe we need to

1601
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,720
interrogate the idea of deception also

1602
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,400
thank you

1603
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,599
oh and finally scott

1604
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,000
oh gosh well it was a great conversation

1605
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,640
i don't have uh much further to add i

1606
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,118
azusha

1607
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,000
you know this this final

1608
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,640
point about the vaccine um

1609
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,760
uh databases i uh

1610
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,000
something i

1611
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,160
need to give more thought about but i i

1612
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,359
will say

1613
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,359
one you know

1614
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,440
again the impulse to track right like oh

1615
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,680
we need to verify who has a vaccine or

1616
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,480
not

1617
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,520
part of the

1618
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,000
issue is that our social fat the reason

1619
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,559
why we think we need that or why some

1620
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,079
people think we need that

1621
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,040
is is because we the social fabric

1622
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,440
in many contexts certainly in the united

1623
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,960
states context

1624
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,520
is so um

1625
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,359
so sprayed

1626
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,240
that there's an incredible lack of trust

1627
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,440
among

1628
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,200
people among communities

1629
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,839
between among each other and between the

1630
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,079
people and and the government that we

1631
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,640
think that um that sort of command and

1632
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,279
control approach is the only thing

1633
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,040
to the extent that my remarks have a

1634
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:25,280
theme is that there's this background

1635
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,319
problem

1636
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,440
um

1637
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,119
that i think are so closely related to

1638
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,280
the surveillance issues um

1639
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,079
uh that um and i don't have solutions

1640
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,559
for them but i think that they are are

1641
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,720
are influencing the conversation in

1642
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,839
important ways but thank you again

1643
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:43,180
um of you learned a great uh deal

1644
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,960
[Music]

1645
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,119
yes thank you so much everyone i think

1646
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,599
this is this is a a very quick one hour

1647
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,599
but it i think we covered a lot of

1648
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,920
ground i think there's several questions

1649
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
that you've raised in your final remarks

1650
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,160
starting from the question of whether

1651
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,480
uh tech is a sector

1652
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,400
the question of of whether sector is

1653
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,559
actually a useful way of of discussing

1654
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,799
such transgressions the ways in which we

1655
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,920
can problematize innovation problematize

1656
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,040
uh disruption and also think about what

1657
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,640
are the ways and and what are the

1658
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,319
challenges that actually emerge when we

1659
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,319
are creating a public sector

1660
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,559
dependencies and also

1661
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,400
enhancing obesity through the ways in

1662
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,200
which

1663
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,599
this ecosystem around

1664
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,599
having private sector

1665
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,400
offer public services um creates so

1666
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,000
thank you so much and thank you so much

1667
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,839
to the organizers at privacy cam for

1668
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,400
giving us this opportunity and uh yeah

1669
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,160
we're going to post a link to our work

1670
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,400
in case you are interested

1671
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,319
and would like to follow it we will have

1672
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,000
a report coming out in a couple of

1673
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,040
months

1674
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,440
thank you again
