1
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
lesson from those employment cases is

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
that contracts are

3
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
dead uh the fictitious types of

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
contracts that the geek economy

5
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
companies like to invent to create a new

6
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,680
legal reality of micro entrepreneurs and

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,799
self-employed contractors working in the

8
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,360
gig economy this is a type of fiction

9
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
um that's legally is dying at least but

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,280
it is being propped up and replaced

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,080
i believe by intensification of

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,920
algorithmic control

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
and backing that up is an

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,000
intensification of surveillance of

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
workers

16
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,479
um

17
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,400
the other thing that's really important

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
as we

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
get this panel underway

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
i believe is to understand that the geek

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
economy is more than just food delivery

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
and passenger transport services

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
i'm so delighted though to have kate for

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
example from uh from the european sex

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
workers alliance um to bring that to

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
life to bring that reality to life and

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
and to show that our understanding is

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
that work is work

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
um in all of its forms

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,600
although the legal constructs around

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
work may change but work spans um

32
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
a broad area and it includes

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,639
greater and lesser definitions of

34
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,440
autonomy versus control but increasingly

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,599
that that autonomy and control is

36
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,720
digitally

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
mediated

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
the second thing we want to understand

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,400
in this in this panel also is that there

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
are great um universal opportunities in

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,959
resisting this type of platform control

42
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,239
of workers

43
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,959
um because of the global nature of these

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
and universal nature of these platforms

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
but also we have to understand that the

46
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
way these platforms

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,680
manage workers and

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
interact with our worker rights

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,599
is very different in the north and south

50
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
context so delighted to have iot to join

51
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,560
us from nigeria to help us understand

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
that a little bit more

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,720
um before getting underway i want to do

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
a little bit of

55
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
advertisement uh working for exchange uh

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
just published for a report last month

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
uh it's called managed by bots

58
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
data-driven exploitation in the geek

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,319
economy please have a look at it

60
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,800
it's uh you can find it a link to it at

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
our website workerexchange.org

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,319
and also on our twitter account which is

63
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
at worker info x

64
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,800
um so with that i'm going to get the

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
panel underway we've got um

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,159
uh

67
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080

national union of app-based transport

71
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
workers in nigeria

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
and live from

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,959
lagos i believe

74
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
and we've got ida

75
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
ponce del castillo from the european

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,879
trade union institute

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
who's an expert in this area of new tech

78
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
and new work

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,080
um so with that let's get underway and

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,959
could i

81
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,920
start with you kate

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,319
sure thank you so much for the

83
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,040
introduction james uh i'm kate mcgrew

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
i'm a sex worker activist and a

85
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
performing artist and um i'm co-convener

86
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,879
of the european sex worker rights

87
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,519
alliance uh and we

88
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,399
represent a hundred

89
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,040
organizations or or um sorry

90
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
organizations and uh countries from

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
europe and uh central asia

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
so i'm very happy to be talking with you

93
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,160
guys today because uh indeed we're often

94
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
not included in the spaces where we very

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,680
much should be because um we're a

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,400
marginalized population like so many

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
other

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
but but uh invisibilized greatly so um

99
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
you know sex work is undoubtedly an

100
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
economic activity

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
that um is informal and

102
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
unprotected for the most part and so the

103
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,560
issues of

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
stigmatization and criminalization that

105
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,320
we face really increase dangers that we

106
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,919
suffer through

107
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,039
so

108
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,160
during the pandemic this has changed for

109
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,039
us

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
sex workers are so used to being

111
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,440
adaptable we're used to navigating these

112
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,320
quasi-legal landscapes and um and we're

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,039
used to having to work around um

114
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
changing laws

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
and um and different uh sort of

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
parameters away around the ways that

117
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
we're able to work

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
so of course in the beginning of the of

119
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
the pandemic

120
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039
a lot of people turned to online work

121
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,039
it seemed like

122
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,720
a very natural and simple

123
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
sort of transition for a lot of workers

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
and when you really look at it from the

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
outset it seems like it might be a more

126
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
preferable way of working

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
you know it's um less danger for workers

128
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,400
when we're

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
not in the physical space of somebody

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
where we're less likely to be physically

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,960
harmed or exploited in those spaces

132
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
however online work isn't really a

133
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
solution

134
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
that was perfect for for people

135
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,720
people

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
some people even prefer on or in person

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
work to online work

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,880
uh

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
to send your image out into the world is

140
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
something that not everybody is

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,759
comfortable with and

142
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
what happens is

143
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,319
for example in ireland where i live and

144
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,840
work

145
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
we have

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
this lopsided

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
law where

148
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,319
as long as a worker works by herself

149
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,880
it's legal to sell sex but our clients

150
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
are criminalized and also working in

151
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
pairs or groups is criminalized under a

152
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
so-called brothel keeping law and we've

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
seen people arrested for this way of

154
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
working which of course is endangering

155
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
for us because we'd like to work

156
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
together

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
but um to have this kind of

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
lopsided

159
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
law

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
has um

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,199
has meant that um

162
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
really it tips the power dynamic towards

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
the clients it's also illegal to

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
advertise here

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
and so

166
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
it bulks up the monopoly of these

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
corporations and organizations that

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,840
therefore can really design their

169
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,520
platforms however they want without any

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
transparency without us understanding

171
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
the way they're doing the algorithm and

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
when more and more people join these

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,479
platforms uh

174
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,120
the prices indeed have been driven down

175
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,039
were pitted against each other in

176
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,599
competition and forced to to start

177
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,240
producing more and more content and

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
often more and more explicit content and

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
of course these platforms are designed

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
with clients in mind

181
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,879
and so you know we're faced with things

182
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,080
like um

183
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
during the pandemic them deciding to

184
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
increase prices for advertising for us

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,280
and we have no power in this realm so um

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
you know sex workers uh it will be

187
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,759
interesting to hear the other panelists

188
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,520
talk because there are many uh

189
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,840
similarities that that we share you know

190
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,280
we we fight for decriminalization um as

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
opposed to legalization because

192
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,840
decriminalization is a more flexible

193
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,039
model

194
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,839
of legal working that doesn't mean that

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,559
there will be no regulations

196
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,760
whatsoever but for example

197
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,479
if we were able to to legally advertise

198
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,200
we could design our own platforms

199
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
and um so this is just one small thing

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
in terms of online work

201
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,720
of why we fight for what we do

202
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
of course we realize that you know there

203
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
can be laws that are passed there was a

204
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,080
law that was passed here after um after

205
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
a leak of nudes on a discord site called

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
coco law and we can pass these laws and

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
and try and criminalize

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
um image-based sexual abuse and

209
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,760
everything but the the reality is sex

210
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
workers um you know we do need to know

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,160
that once our image is out in the world

212
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,800
it's no longer under our control

213
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
and you know again we really just don't

214
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
know

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,279
what is being done with our data

216
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
and so um

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
for you know when the digital services

218
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,160
act there was passed it it was very good

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
news for us that there seems to be some

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
sort of mechanism

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
for

222
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
users to report content

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
that that is ours that has been stolen

224
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
but there are still issues around

225
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,399
them wanting to increase

226
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
what we need to provide for these sites

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
and and those include our phone numbers

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
and those include emails and and this

229
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
doesn't solve the problem of revenge

230
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,959
porn it

231
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
unfortunately it is easy enough for um

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,240
you know for somebody to for example get

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
a sim card and use a fake number that

234
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
way so

235
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
really we just um

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,920
we're fighting and trying to get into

237
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,680
these spaces as much as possible to

238
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,160
raise our issues around

239
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
needing to get some kind of control

240
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
around our work

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
through decriminalization

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,839
and through

243
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
transparency and through solidarity

244
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,959
across

245
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,760
um

246
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
worker

247
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
uh communities

248
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,200
we very much need to be

249
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,640
understood as as people who arguably

250
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
more so than any other kind of worker uh

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
truly need uh labor laws

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
and so um

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
those are just a few of the issues we we

254
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
deal with you know of course we can see

255
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,839
um

256
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
with something like sesta fossa i'm not

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
sure if you're familiar with this but

258
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,800
when they shut down uh back page

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
in the name of trying to stop

260
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,519
trafficking

261
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
what ended up happening was not only had

262
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
back page been a place for

263
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
um for police to be able to to track and

264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
find people who might be being exploited

265
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,920
therefore pushing them into

266
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,519
essentially underground and into the

267
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
darkness more but people who are

268
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
advertising on backpage ended up going

269
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
back into

270
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,120
the hands of people who were

271
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
potentially exploiting them before or

272
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,519
going back out into the street and

273
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,959
working that way

274
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
so we are continually arguing for more

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,959
and safer options of ways of working and

276
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,560
also um

277
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
highlighting you know the stigma around

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,639
our work is very unhelpful you know when

279
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
we listen to io do you speak speak i'll

280
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
be very interested to

281
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,320
hear what he has to say because um from

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
our perspective it's

283
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,839
ignored that we know that taxi drivers

284
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,279
experience a high level of violence but

285
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
sex workers because of the misogyny and

286
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
the infantilization

287
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
around who we are

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,240
um

289
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
we get seen as a work that is

290
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,560
exclusively um dangerous to us and and

291
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
based on these presumptions and these

292
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
sort of uh blinkered vision

293
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
understanding of our work they pass laws

294
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
that actually make things worse for us

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
they they drive us into the hands when

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
we don't have legal and vetted options

297
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,760
of people to work with we're left with a

298
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,399
bulked-up black market of people who are

299
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,360
poised and ready to exploit our

300
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,160
um

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
our lack of options so i suppose those

302
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
are a few things i'll say for now and i

303
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,399
look forward to hearing from everybody

304
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,600
and taking questions thanks

305
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
well thank you very much kate for that

306
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
um

307
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
fascinating uh

308
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
journey through um

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,240
the challenges that uh sex workers face

310
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,360
in the in the very much real uh economy

311
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,920
but also in the online platform economy

312
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
and how that interacts um

313
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,880
uh

314
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
with with uh with

315
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
with workers and with the broader gig

316
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
economy there are certainly um some some

317
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,560
great common threads that run across the

318
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,399
gig economy between sex workers and um

319
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,720
and and transport workers

320
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
the one thing that comes to mind

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
immediately as i i know that you know

322
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
uber drivers for years

323
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,480
have asked for a sort of a panic button

324
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
it used to be in the analog world if the

325
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
driver had a dangerous passenger they

326
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,639
were able to call dispatch very quickly

327
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
and and nearby drivers would just come

328
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
along so that there was visibility and

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
protection and it was usually enough to

330
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
calm things down but the irony of

331
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,279
joining a platform like uber is that

332
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,720
although you're

333
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
never more connected you're actually

334
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
never more alone because the platform

335
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,760
prohibits uh stops workers from

336
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,959
connecting with each other and

337
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
supporting

338
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
each other

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,440
and also i think in terms of the the

340
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,079
marginalization

341
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,279
because of transport work is sensitive

342
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
in terms of

343
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
carrying vulnerable passengers safeguard

344
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
safeguarding is a really important issue

345
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
but it's led to

346
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,340
a

347
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,600
[Music]

348
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,920
greater police enforcement and

349
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,519
surveillance of the industry and the

350
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
marginalization

351
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
of uh what's often a minority

352
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,959
dominated workforce so a lot of these

353
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,880
issues of sort of

354
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,920
policing criminalization marginalization

355
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
of the workforce i feel a very very um a

356
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
very very familiar indeed across that

357
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
gig economy

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,839
um so next on our list is

359
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,399
iot ayode abraham is the um the

360
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,240
president and founder of the national

361
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,360
union of app-based transport workers

362
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
in nigeria he's also the president of

363
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,399
the international alliance of that base

364
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,959
transport workers which is one of the

365
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
largest alliance

366
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
international alliances of

367
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,240
of

368
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
app-based transport workers

369
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
in the world at the moment and iowa can

370
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
i hand over to you

371

foster our

377
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
our problem to the world so that we can

378
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,839
have a solution to it thank you very

379
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,800
much for the good work you do always

380

uh my name is um ibrahim as he rightly

381
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,480
said

382
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
i'm the founder and president of

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
national you know professional happiest

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
transport worker here in nigeria as well

385
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
as vice president of international

386
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,120
alliance habits transport workers

387
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,480
our problem

388
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,279
is our problem

389
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,360
let me start

390
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
an algorithm control

391
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
that is a great magical management

392
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
of uber and boats because algorithm

393
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
control is the one that do a lot of work

394
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
to drivers blocking the drivers do a lot

395
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
of things even in the income these are

396
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
the things that control

397
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,199
um

398
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,759
our movement on on the road through the

399
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,279
gps

400
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,519
but now say this

401
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
the algorithm control

402
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,040
is not clear to us as a driver the way

403
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
amana

404
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
uber

405
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,120
and other companies manage these systems

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,079
because this system operates in one way

407
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,360
sided

408
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,440
or if

409
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,920
if a customer

410
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,759
give a report

411
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
to the platform

412
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,800
there is no way the driver will have

413
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,079
opportunity

414
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,839
to defend themselves into the block

415
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,679
immediately and this this one caused a

416
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
lot of problems in terms of

417
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,000
income in terms of safety in terms of

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
everything around our operations let me

419
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,559
give an example

420
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,039
if a polar driver borrow money from bank

421
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,559
to put a car into a particular platform

422
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,959
like uber another platform

423
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,520
and they may be after two weeks and you

424
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
carry a customer and the customer now

425
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
make a report

426
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
automatically will be blocked and when

427
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,480
it blocks you cannot see money again

428
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,960
is to settle the loan that collect from

429
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
the bank

430
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,960
these are the major problem that

431
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,480
the driver face

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
and

433
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,039
it's very pro

434
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,840
from graduate for us to really sort out

435
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,120
how this uh

436
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
algorithm works

437
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
and we're still talking about the data

438
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
that all these are companies you know

439
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,039
collect from us

440
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,360
and what baffled us is that

441
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,280
there's a lot of data for example in

442
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,799
nigeria

443
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,960
they collect many data in nigeria that

444
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
even the regulation is not capturing

445
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
because there is nobody that's money to

446
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,679
our attacker what they do with our data

447
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,840
how they use our data how our data has

448
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
been managed

449
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
nobody knows

450
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
nobody knows and this is worrisome for

451
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,080
us as a driver

452
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,280
because

453
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
when we are talking about income

454
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
of a driver everything basically on how

455
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,919
the driver works and how the driver gets

456
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,960
incomes and how the drivers will be able

457
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,480
to you know

458
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,799
manage himself on the road but all this

459
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
thing is not transparent

460
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
we are just working in a black blanket

461
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
system that whatever they give to us is

462
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,520
what we work on

463
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
so these are the major problems that we

464
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
have with this issue of data concerning

465
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,280
our safety let me now give you an

466
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,640
example if a driver work

467
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
for a particular

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
weeks and is supposed to get like 20 000

469
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,679
nera let me just use it as a nigeria

470
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
currency and and at the end of the day

471
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
the driver cannot get it maybe

472
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,320
in a

473
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,919
space of

474
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
two hours and in the space of eight

475
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
hours according to the labor law in

476
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,960
nigeria

477
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
automatically the driver will have to

478
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
walk more

479
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
and the way you walk more they are going

480
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
to be a fatigue when they suffer

481
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,559
they are going to be an accident

482
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,720
because when somebody is tired already

483
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,799
and they cannot stop because of income

484
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,320
and because of the peace that you want

485
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
to pay this one to produce the effort of

486
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,840
the safety

487
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
on our in our platform and

488
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,600
we try to organize drivers

489
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
to educate developers

490
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
in respect of we are doing all this

491
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
the major problem is that all these are

492
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
companies never ever

493
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,280
respect the lord the labor law

494
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,679
they never respect the labour law

495
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,520
they only do whatever they like and i

496
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
will start to become an example

497
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,840
recently about a week ago

498
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
brutal animal just come from nowhere i

499
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
increased the the commission

500
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
uber is taking 25 percent before the

501
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
increases to 28 which we have evidence

502
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
god decide they send they made to us

503
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
that they increased their commissions

504
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,320
to 28 cents and

505
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
both increased their own to 25 percent

506
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
without noticing they can just wake up

507
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,240
one day

508
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
and do whatever they

509
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,000
likes are with challenges because

510
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
there's no proper regulation there's no

511
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
proper monitoring

512
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,760
these are the

513
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,679
opportunities that all these ar

514
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,600
companies are using against us because

515
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,720
nobody really understands how this

516
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
system works

517
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,360
and how this policy needs to be

518
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
put in place to help

519
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
the drivers and when we're now talking

520
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,480
about

521
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
how

522
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,600
we organize

523
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,799
how the incomes how the safety the

524
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,640
safety is so bad in nigeria to

525
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
understand that not only accidents

526
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,159
but

527
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,440
attacking

528
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
ambrose

529
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
thieves and what causes it is our

530
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,520
company you know what because they take

531
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,720
money

532
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
they take money you know more important

533
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
than my life and i will tell you why

534
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,840
for example there are supposed to be a

535
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,440
profiling coffee rider

536
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
in their in their

537
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
in their system

538
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
but they refuse to do that

539
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
because what they are trying to do is

540
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
that they just want anybody to pick a

541
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
scene

542
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,159
and just make a request without too much

543
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
questions so that they can request and

544
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,400
this one is putting high risk into a

545
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
driver

546
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
we lost a lot of pro paper here in

547
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,799
nigeria

548
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,080
last year

549
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,840
mostly last year i'm not even talking

550
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
about previous year the last year one is

551
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
too much

552
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,080
because we just discovered that

553
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
people will just request and take you to

554
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,799
the remote area and collect your money

555
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,400
or they even collect your car and they

556
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
even keep you in the process

557
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,919
when we go back to all this app

558
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,039
convenience

559
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,520
please that's why i said it's on active

560
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
right

561
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
and this is the problem

562
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
they will not give us any

563
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,280
any data of the customers because they

564
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
don't even really have the data of the

565
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
customer what they really need to do is

566
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
about their commission

567
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,320
immediately they collect their

568
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,880
commission in fact imagine

569
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
somebody carried a rider and in the

570
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,679
process the car was smashing in the

571
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,840
process the guy was dying

572
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
was killed by the by the rider do you

573
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
know that they still collect their

574
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,440
commission on the dead person

575
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,840
these are these are these are the irony

576
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,559
of what driver is passing through

577
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,600
on that street on that road every day

578
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
and

579
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,480
we we we make a lot of noise

580
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,320
to the authorities

581
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
and the other problem we have especially

582
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
in nigeria before i compare it is

583
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,480
most of even the organization did not

584
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,640
understand how this

585
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,400
industry works

586
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
for example uber will go to our

587
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
government and tell them that look we

588
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,440
will provide employment for the youth of

589
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,799
your country

590
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,720
meanwhile all these things is just in my

591
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
mirage

592
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,480
where the employment they provide for us

593
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
when we buy our car we fill our car we

594
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
do everything around our cars

595
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,559
in fact we still pay them salary through

596
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
our commission the world we walk on the

597
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,679
road

598
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,280
but even the government does not even

599
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,000
understand how this technology works

600
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,600
that's the major problem even most of

601
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,039
the people they want to do regulation

602
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,440
today did they have consultants did they

603
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,840
consult people did they really know how

604
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
this

605
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,400
the system works because these are the

606
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
things that uber bought and another

607
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
company are used to manipulate the

608
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,679
system and the government that's coming

609
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,080
so these are the major problems that we

610
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,720
have in this system when we now compare

611
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
what is happening in the north and the

612
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
south

613
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
you can see that

614
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
yes this the not is not

615
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,400
really

616
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,360
you know

617
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,159
happy with our companies but compared to

618
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,880
south the south is in deep

619
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
because let me give an example in uk

620
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,080
there

621
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
they have a regulator called

622
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,720
cfl it might not make the mistakes the

623
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
tfl is the one to usually nonsense

624
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
to a driver

625
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,240
if you commit any crime

626
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
on the platform boat

627
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
or uber

628
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
you cannot go to a boat to go and work

629
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
but it doesn't work like that in nigeria

630
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,039
in africa generally it doesn't work like

631
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,480
that

632
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,880
somebody can have a criminal record from

633
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,840
uber

634
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,080
and they're successfully operating on

635
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,120
boards

636
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
because there is no central

637
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,720
regulation

638
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,400
that happened in uk like nigeria and

639
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,799
where you are talking about income

640
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,080
do not is making money down the south

641
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
there's no doubt about it

642
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,480
because no matter how hard the knot is

643
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
they are still making because the system

644
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
in the north

645
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
is working at least

646
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
it's working to a certain length

647
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,640
that the system in the south is dead

648
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,520
conservative technology

649
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
many things is not right

650
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,919
so these are the difference although

651
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,679
there's a lot of problem

652
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,480
for example the

653
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
issue of the judgment that uber is not

654
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,760
fully respect the supreme court judgment

655
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
you know they begin to gamble of many

656
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
things but the first thing it means that

657
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,960
they are they they respect certain part

658
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
of that judgment that is not happening

659
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,679
like that in the south

660
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,440
when we compare what is happening in the

661
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,400
uk

662
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
like california for example

663
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,200
during the time of april 22

664
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,720
uber tricked the driver and the citizen

665
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,080
the customer that look if they vote for

666
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,919
the pro 22 there won't be an

667
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,080
increasement there won't be any problem

668
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
the driver will make more money after

669
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,559
they won that elections

670
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,159
after they won that election they

671
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,520
increased the price

672
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
the driver they give the opportunity to

673
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
pick any right they reflect all those

674
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,919
rights all those opportunities you can

675
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,080
see how tricky

676
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
the uber and other company they are they

677
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,279
make agreements they make agreement they

678
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
will never honor that agreement

679
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,039
they will say one thing today tomorrow

680
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,799
they will say another thing

681
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
despite that

682
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
the california have to wait for the

683
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,679
federal law

684
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
despite that just enjoying their lusty

685
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
more active than the south because

686
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
there's a lot of thing in the south that

687
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,240
is not working concerned with technology

688
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
but what we have what we enjoy the south

689
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,679
is this

690
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,919
now we have opportunity

691
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,080
to organize ourselves

692
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
to dr we have done a lot of protests

693
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,240
with successfully a lot of protests and

694
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
we use media

695
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,480
to fight back hardly you see in the week

696
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
that we're not making us on in

697
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,880
in in in the media

698
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
so we have opportunity that was working

699
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
for us in the south very well and we are

700
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,279
using that opportunity

701
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,919
very very well and we make that that

702
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,960
particular opportunity to make them

703
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,399
uncomfortable

704
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,080
because they have to be run up and down

705
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
to our government to jesus to that if to

706
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
say our government really understand why

707
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,600
they wrote to them tell their lives

708
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
they're supposed to come back to us it

709
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,240
doesn't happen that we still continue

710
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
to push because that is our power to

711
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,520
organize ourselves to come together to

712
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
make things happen that is our power in

713
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,559
that organizing we have three categories

714
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
of people

715
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
because when you want to organize we

716
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
want to go for protests you must do in a

717
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
way that everybody come out

718
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,039
but we discover that you have three

719
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,799
categories of people

720
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
and that's a time when we call for

721
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,360
protests

722
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
people will call me mass attack people

723
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,159
will not come in mass when we do that

724
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,039
outside we observe that look

725
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,159
there are some people they have their

726
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,000
own car on that platform if you call

727
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
them today to go for protests they will

728
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,279
they will know it because they don't

729
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
deliver to anybody

730
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,200
they don't give anybody delivery and

731
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,120
they don't pay to bank that is some

732
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,039
category we we basically use those

733
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,080
categories to do protests to do strike

734
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
the second category is people that

735
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
borrow money we call them hp higher

736
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
positions people are money from the bank

737
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,240
and they use that money to buy the car

738
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
and put into their platform this one

739
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
cannot stay

740
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,919
too much when you call for the protest

741
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,760
because they want to meet up

742
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,679
and they have to pay their loan back

743
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,880
into the

744
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,200
into the categories we always look at

745
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,360
the time that they make more money look

746
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
we have to spare your five hours today

747
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
six hours today so let's join together

748
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,240
so we only basically basically use that

749
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
their own parameter to call for strike

750
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
the third one is the people orientation

751
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
just go to somebody maybe you go to the

752
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,840
logistics firm or you go you'll find

753
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
somebody that can buy the car for you

754
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
and we call them work and eat because if

755
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,480
they don't go out in the day there is no

756
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,399
way they will feed their family so these

757
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,679
categories we always stay and see how we

758
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,120
can manage fear

759
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
to join us in the protest the best part

760
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,799
is that

761
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,480
the major dangerous one the health

762
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
company is using is to use driver

763
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,159
against trevor

764
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
you know they pass on driver money to do

765
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,480
dirty job for them

766
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,360
they will use that and people we may not

767
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,600
really understand but when you compare

768
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,919
not they do the same thing like that but

769
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,720
it's not effectively like south

770
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,440
because the south because of economy

771
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
because of what people are going through

772
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
it's very easy for them to manipulate

773
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,760
some driver but it not it's not going to

774
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,279
be easy like that although people are

775
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,600
passing through a lot there like america

776
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
like uk like canada australia

777
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,559
even india

778
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,960
so but the first thing it means that

779
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
they can you know be able to navigate

780
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,080
for example during the code profit 19

781
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
the american driver have opportunity

782
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,559
although i know it's not easy to get

783
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,039
this help from the government i don't

784
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,960
know the name they call it to get the

785
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,640
help from the government

786
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,039
maybe unemployment allowance or

787
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,360
something so that one most of the

788
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,760
drivers in america got it back then but

789
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
in south there is nothing like that

790
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,960
so these are the

791
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
things that but one permanent thing is

792
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,480
that our problems are deceived

793
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
the way the uber treats

794
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
drivers in uk

795
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
they even treat driver

796
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,200
badly

797
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
more badly in africa and nigeria so

798
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,880
these are the things

799
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
that

800
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
we experience

801
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
in our industry and thank god for people

802
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,039
like james barra that they can break the

803
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,720
they can break the barriers let me just

804
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,919
put this like that they break the

805
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,720
barriers because that's that particular

806
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,679
case

807
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,039
that they want

808
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,960
is the only thing that give you know

809
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,159
roadmap

810
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,600
to the world because see what is

811
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,679
happening in europeans now european you

812
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,559
know european parliament they use cases

813
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,480
to do and what is happening to us here

814
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
in nigeria that give us drive

815
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
to take uber to talk about is because of

816
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,279
what the games foreign did

817
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
to break the barriers to yeah this is

818
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,919
impossible guys let's move on

819
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,600
and that's what gives us for opportunity

820
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,399
too in nigeria that we can drive them to

821
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,960
our court of appeals here in nigeria and

822
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
i will drop them to the um industrial uh

823
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,320
industrial

824
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,120
ever cut here in nigeria so these are

825
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
the things that i think

826
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,039
they did not

827
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,200
did that the south uh emulates them to

828
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,919
copy them and be able to to do this so

829
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,440
in a roundup

830
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
i believe

831
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
with the people like

832
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
jeffers in the system that you know put

833
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,679
prayer and whatever and people like us

834
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,279
and with the organization we are

835
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,360
bringing on board now international

836
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,159
alliance our base transport workers i

837
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,039
think

838
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,480
the hope of draft globally is certain

839
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,519
and

840
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,480
everything will be well pleased the way

841
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
we want it in terms of policy the time

842
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,120
of regulation the time of income

843
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,519
presently now we started campaign on the

844
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,840
application and the blockage of drivers

845
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
because we pick it international level

846
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
that these are the things that happen

847
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,840
across the world

848
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
that the activation is happening every

849
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,440
part of the world

850
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,320
and the blockage is and this is unfair

851
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,880
this is unfair and secondly

852
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
because if you don't have that data

853
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,799
there is no way you know can negotiate

854
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,360
for his member so these are the things i

855
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,840
i think the globally uh we are trying to

856
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,080
work on it and everything we will find

857
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,960
thank you

858
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
thank you thank you aj thanks very much

859
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,880
for that wonderful

860
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,279
presentation i mean some of the issues

861
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,960
that come out of there that is really

862
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,600
important to reminders is the the

863
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,279
financial risk

864
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,120
that workers take in this industry by

865
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,559
financing vehicles taking out loans then

866
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,559
answering a call answering a promise

867
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,880
that when you go on a platform like uber

868
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
or bolt that that's a free market it's

869
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,880
not a free market it's algorithmically

870
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,720
controlled and so therefore it's really

871
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,399
very very very important if you're going

872
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,799
to enter that world that you understand

873
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,720
you have transparency to the algorithmic

874
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,880
rules that are filtering that market

875
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,559
because otherwise it's not not fair to

876
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,559
ask you to finance a vehicle and find

877
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
that you know your hand has been tied

878
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,840
behind your back uh all the time

879
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,880
um in terms of safety uh really really

880
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,720
really stark reminders of of some of the

881
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
deaths and injuries that have happened

882
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,760
uh to nigerian drivers um yeah

883
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,399
unfortunately this this is a reality in

884
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,159
the west and the north as well in in

885
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,279
london uh 50 of the private hire drivers

886
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,000
have been physically assaulted uh 85

887
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,679
percent have suffered some kind of hate

888
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,880
abuse or islamophobia and so it's pretty

889
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
pretty terrible uh for workers and and

890
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,399
also in terms of the police interaction

891
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,560
as well there's a terrible story

892
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,440
um in dublin a few weeks ago about a uh

893
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,359
delivery rider who was extorted by the

894
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,399
police

895
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,280
um took hundreds of euros from that um

896
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,119
delivery female delivery worker on a

897
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,280
bicycle escorted her home to get money

898
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,918
from her as a kind of a tax to workers

899
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,079
something like that be happening

900
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,760
in dublin is

901
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
is outrageous

902
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,480
um

903
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,839
and finally you know in terms of the

904
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
commission it is absolutely right for

905
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,359
for uber to justify taking 28

906
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,639
uh in nigeria but take 25 or 20

907
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,040
in the north that's just complete

908
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,719
exploitation of uh the global south

909
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,760
and where we need to be really vigilant

910
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,119
now is on our data protection rights

911
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,960
because as a result of some of the work

912
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
we've been doing and challenging um for

913
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,480
data access and algorithmic transparency

914
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,240
and uber

915
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,040
used to control all its data outside of

916
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,000
north america in amsterdam and that gave

917
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,960
all the workers out in those territories

918
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,200
extra territorial gdpr rights uh in in

919
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,839
europe and since we started exercising

920
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,320
these um just november last year uber

921
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
changed all that to bring data

922
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,400
controllership all of those countries

923
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,200
outside europe back to north america

924
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
now the interesting thing we'll see and

925
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,119
i look forward to working with on the on

926
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,119
this with you iot is that

927
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,359
is that nigeria actually on paper has

928
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,680
got very good data protection laws very

929
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
equivalent to gdpr

930
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,839
now let's see if we can work together

931
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,320
with your organization in nigeria and

932
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
the international athletes transport

933
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,320
workers to hold uber to account to say

934
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,960
you must you must obey the law

935
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
in nigeria you must

936
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
obey digital rights for workers

937
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
universally across that platform

938
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,520
irregardless of whether you're in europe

939
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,839
or nigeria or elsewhere and let's see if

940
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,200
we can hold them to account for that

941
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,560
because there's no reason why they

942
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
shouldn't

943
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
they shouldn't follow those

944
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,280
same rights okay we'll move on so um

945
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,480
next up is um aida

946
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,520
invitation james and happy to share uh

971
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,119
thoughts with kate

972
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,119
and um

973
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,680
i would like to well uh

974
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
also for a point of comparison bring in

975
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,720
the global south from the latin america

976
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,079
perspective so um i would like to speak

977
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
about three things uh some issues in

978
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,160
latin america some and some risks and

979
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,040
what are the limitations of of of a

980
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,359
platform directive like we are doing now

981
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
in the eu are

982
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,359
so uh the

983
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,920
issues that latin america is facing is

984
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
that the platform business model needs

985
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,920
to be this demystified because some

986
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
workers

987
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,000
think that there is no way

988
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,240
out of this precariousness of the

989
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,320
working conditions and that this

990
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,800
precariousness is an essential part of

991
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
the business model

992
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
uh we can see in nigeria that

993
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,839
it is very present of course but

994
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,720
what we are trying to to convey through

995
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,200
the work of etui another researcher is

996
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,160
that working conditions can be decent

997
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,160
and fair and transparent within the

998
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
platform business model and with any

999
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,720
other business model actually but in

1000
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,280
latin america we also have seen

1001
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,440
the intensification of the business

1002
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,320
model

1003
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
the number of digital platforms grew

1004
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,520
uh between 2020 and 2021

1005
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,480
because of the pandemics many services

1006
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,440
went or hired a platform to deliver to

1007
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
the customer

1008
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
and also

1009
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
the the modalities were seen as an

1010
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,880
opportunity when unemployment was

1011
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
present of course

1012
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,599
in latin america there are not only uh

1013
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,240
uh european or um

1014
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,839
um

1015
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,079
um

1016
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,760
i don't know why i disappear from the

1017
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,920
screen but i'm not touching any button

1018
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,320
but in a latin america i was explaining

1019
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,839
there are also uh digital platforms uh

1020
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,240
coming from china which also changes the

1021
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,119
rules of the game uh which are

1022
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
the the digital platforms in which we

1023
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,359
are used to deal with in europe are a

1024
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,520
little bit different to those that are

1025
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,560
present or undriven by chinese companies

1026
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,079
also um

1027
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,320
there are um

1028
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,480
plans for legislation

1029
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,599
but the legislation goes in two ways

1030
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,200
there is a plan for legislation in

1031
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,359
mexico for example that aims at

1032
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,839
regulating the pricing

1033
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,000
for the customer because it's an unfair

1034
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
competition so this is about the pricing

1035
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,599
which is nothing related to labor law or

1036
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,280
working conditions

1037
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
but there are other discussions about

1038
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
having legislation to improve the labor

1039
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,240
conditions of platform workers which

1040
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,319
could be a similar instrument like the

1041
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,599
one we're crafting in the eu

1042
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,400
workers are being organized so they are

1043
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
trade unions organizing them

1044
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,240
and

1045
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
for example there is a movement as no

1046
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,680
more deliveries without rights very

1047
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,480
clear workers have the idea

1048
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,640
and are aware that their rights should

1049
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,839
be recognized and respected so

1050
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,640
this is what is happening and but also

1051
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
they are quite aware that there is

1052
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,599
not only a bilateral negotiation

1053
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
need for negotiation for a trilateral in

1054
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,760
which the government needs to be

1055
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
involved and this is what they are they

1056
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,680
are asking for actually this is a

1057
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,319
particular case in latin america

1058
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,960
the bill to regulate the

1059
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,480
pricing of the delivery is being

1060
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
discussed in the senate

1061
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,920
and the ideas for crafting a regulation

1062
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
that is similar to the directive on

1063
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,040
improving working conditions on platform

1064
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
work is just being discussed and being

1065
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,760
put in the table of negotiations

1066
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,200
what are

1067
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,119
the particular risks

1068
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,599
um a distinction

1069
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,280
uh between

1070
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
for example the conditions in mexico and

1071
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,400
the conditions in latin america is

1072
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,079
i can divide them in three dimensions

1073
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,040
three dimensions of risks

1074
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,800
first dimension is related to the

1075
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,040
infrastructure well

1076
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,240
roads in latin america are not made for

1077
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
bicycles or for motorcycles they are

1078
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,839
made for cars and big vehicles so that's

1079
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,200
a very big distinction their

1080
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,839
infrastructure for cycling paths are not

1081
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,800
there hence the number of accidents is

1082
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,760
is is bigger

1083
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
the second dimension of the risk is

1084
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,760
related to the political and social

1085
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,119
environment

1086
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,800
criminality

1087
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,920
is the biggest risk to which riders are

1088
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
confronted too

1089
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,359
and hence uh

1090
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,119
there is a more uh perhaps um number of

1091
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,920
men than women but women are also

1092
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,839
present in this uh as as a as the

1093
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,680
platform workers

1094
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,800
also

1095
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,839
uh

1096
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,160
the use of motorbikes and motorcycles is

1097
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
higher than the use of bicycles because

1098
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
they can just do quicker in these

1099
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,040
difficult areas of course it's also

1100
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,920
related to the lack of infrastructure

1101
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,800
why the bicycles are not really um

1102
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
present in

1103
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,800
in in big cities uh

1104
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,079
uh being designed to be driven uh to be

1105
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,160
populated by cars

1106
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,480
now the third dimension of risks is

1107
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,079
related to working conditions and

1108
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,960
occupational health and safety well as

1109
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,040
we have seen because the infrastructure

1110
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,839
does not allow to have bicycles on the

1111
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,800
road

1112
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,920
then uh the accidents are higher

1113
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,200
and uh

1114
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,560
since the the workers are available 20

1115
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,599
hours

1116
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,000
uh of the day

1117
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,400
there is no really work-life balance

1118
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
whatsoever which is quite quite hard in

1119
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,599
latin america many services are open uh

1120
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,560
all the time literally

1121
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,400
work intensity is considerably high for

1122
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,800
example there is a study carried out by

1123
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,319
mexican uh researchers that

1124
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,319
says that there are more or less an

1125
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,599
average of 10 deliverers every day per

1126
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,400
driver which is quite high i believe

1127
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,280
and

1128
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,160
we know that also common psychosocial

1129
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,079
issues are present

1130
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,800
we have an etui study made by my

1131
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,280
colleague with pierre berastagi

1132
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,160
uh outlining and mapping the common

1133
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,760
risks that we have

1134
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,280
like anxiety

1135
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,800
stress repressed depression but also

1136
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,640
boars boredom and alienation and the

1137
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,000
diminish of the self-team in drivers is

1138
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,680
really present in the gig economy uh so

1139
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,960
to speak

1140
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,240
so uh this is a kind of a very very uh

1141
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
big um

1142
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,800
uh

1143
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,200
overview of what are the difference

1144
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,800
between uh

1145
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,040
the north of south from a latin american

1146
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,560
perspective

1147
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,799
thank you

1148
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,319
things disappear but it could be on any

1149
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,319
minute

1150
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,560
well well james come back

1151
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
maybe i can um

1152
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,680
yeah well he's back

1153
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
hello hello my

1154
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,480
big big fingers here i um touch the

1155
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,720
disconnect button rather than the um

1156
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,599
button my apologies i i wonder in just

1157
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,200
in the in the couple of minutes that

1158
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,599
you've got a remaining idea and

1159
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,400
guillermo i wonder if are we open to

1160
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,560
taking questions that

1161
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,040
would be now would be a good time to to

1162
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,200
start seeing those questions but i

1163
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
wonder if you had a minute to

1164
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,880
can't hear me

1165
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,960
now you can hear me i okay i wonder if

1166
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,880
you had a minute to just tell us a

1167
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,960
little bit more about the

1168
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,920
algorithmic control protections we may

1169
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,520
see in the europe draft european

1170
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,640
directive

1171
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
you had a minute to tell us a little bit

1172
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,960
about that yeah yes there is uh this

1173
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,119
draft directive on improving working

1174
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,359
conditions in platform work

1175
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,280
and this is really a great initiative

1176
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,599
because um it covers not only the riders

1177
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,480
or the delivery

1178
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,440
workers it covers every single worker in

1179
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,800
the platform business model so it has it

1180
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
it's designed to cover

1181
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,599
um everybody so that's a really a great

1182
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,160
uh news from the european commission and

1183
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,119
it also recognizes some new rights uh in

1184
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,359
phase of algorithmic management which is

1185
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,680
really really cool to be honest because

1186
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,960
the ai act define algorithmic management

1187
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,760
but not really in a comprehensive way

1188
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,480
here we have a good definition

1189
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,319
it can be improved though because

1190
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,480
algorithmic management is very technic

1191
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,400
it's technically uh

1192
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,960
complex because of the many layers

1193
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,680
of processes involved

1194
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,760
but uh the directive could be improved

1195
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,000
when it's going to be negotiated and

1196
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,880
it's going to be negotiated really fast

1197
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,920
one because the french presidency

1198
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,000
uh has uh

1199
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,440
this uh file in its priority

1200
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,160
so they will put a lot of effort so that

1201
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,079
this directive will be

1202
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,280
adopted

1203
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,599
quite soon and because the commission

1204
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,000
really wants this to be uh

1205
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,280
regulated

1206
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,720
so um

1207
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,839
we have the first trap draft a month ago

1208
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,079
and now the the parliament is going to

1209
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,040
take over for the future negotiations

1210
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,119
so there are some specific rights on

1211
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,000
algorithmic management like the right to

1212
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,880
have access to the information and being

1213
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,920
consulted so the workers individually or

1214
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,319
collectively are can access to the

1215
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,599
algorithm

1216
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,839
and to the processes

1217
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,599
that will

1218
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,839
make or assist in their the in the

1219
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,359
decisions in regarding them

1220
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,000
quite similar to gdpr so very happy that

1221
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,720
the

1222
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,800
the commission has recognized that the

1223
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,240
gdpr principles apply in this area of

1224
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,520
the economy

1225
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,040
but um

1226
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,119
yet perhaps for example

1227
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,839
there should be the right to portability

1228
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,240
one of the key issues that workers have

1229
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,200
already signaled and this draft doesn't

1230
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,559
contain it

1231
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,359
so there might be a nice interesting

1232
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,640
negotiation

1233
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,359
aspects to in regards to introducing the

1234
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,599
right to portability not only about the

1235
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,599
data and the good reviews but the whole

1236
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,319
profile including the skills of workers

1237
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,000
that are acquiring in in in their jobs

1238
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
so this right of course

1239
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,200
portability could include to transfer

1240
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,839
uh workers data profiles and skills to

1241
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,480
other digital platform of course but

1242
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,040
it's also interesting if workers would

1243
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,280
be able and have the capacity to

1244
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,680
transfer outside the digital platform

1245
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,000
economy to any other employer

1246
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,079
so uh yeah it could be uh something to

1247
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,720
pitch into the directive then the right

1248
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,359
to review it's there it's okay it's

1249
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,359
quite broad it's not really

1250
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,079
how to contest an algorithm through gdpr

1251
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,119
has been very difficult

1252
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,240
this directive introduces or recognizes

1253
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
this right to review but this doesn't

1254
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
really tell us how

1255
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,880
it's quite similar like articles 22 gdpr

1256
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,079
so i think that there must be um

1257
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,480
for example the right

1258
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
for workers uh to really understand the

1259
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,400
whole of the

1260
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,640
evidence and information that the

1261
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,559
platform is supposed to

1262
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,920
um

1263
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
to um to give uh back

1264
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,119
but also to have uh for example the

1265
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,960
labor inspectorate to review the

1266
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,839
algorithms or to have a third-party

1267
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,000
conformity assessment before those

1268
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,720
algorithms be put into place and be

1269
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,040
deployed by the digital platform and of

1270
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,040
course uh another common um request from

1271
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,599
the trade union movement has been the

1272
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,839
right or the possibility to have a an

1273
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,880
independent arbitration with regards

1274
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,680
when when a decision is being made off

1275
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,280
now here

1276
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,280
the the directive doesn't really

1277
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,040
distinguish us between automated

1278
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,079
decisions or semi-automated decisions

1279
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,119
which is the case of uber and other

1280
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,920
platforms and uh i think that their

1281
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,319
directive should make this distinction

1282
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,440
because not all decisions are automated

1283
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,480
and

1284
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,119
even when a human is

1285
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,000
in between the decision making process

1286
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,040
the right to review that decision should

1287
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,839
be exercisable by workers this is very

1288
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,880
important and if the directive doesn't

1289
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,800
elucidate this this

1290
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,040
then the right is completely lost

1291
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,200
and of course the right to communicate

1292
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,040
among themselves it's another

1293
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,960
new right in the

1294
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,680
in the in the proposal it's great i

1295
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,000
think it's possible it should be

1296
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,240
possible for the workers to communicate

1297
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,839
among themselves

1298
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,200
but

1299
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,960
in the same platform

1300
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,359
so something that

1301
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,800
something that the digital platform

1302
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,040
should make available otherwise

1303
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,440
there might be the risk of

1304
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,040
miscommunication or or

1305
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
to discriminate workers that cannot do

1306
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,480
it other way

1307
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,640
so there must be a way for digital

1308
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
platforms to implement mechanisms

1309
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
of of communication

1310
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,839
uh and this will allow of course workers

1311
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,640
to be uh organized more

1312
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,839
easily to be represented easily and to

1313
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,800
exchange uh in a in a better way and

1314
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,920
perhaps to do collective bargaining um

1315
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,559
more easily so these are really really

1316
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,720
very few things that i can share with

1317
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,359
respect to algorithm management but of

1318
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,920
course that directly goes more further

1319
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,440
thank you james

1320
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,520
thank you so much adam we'll let you go

1321
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,640
thank you that was that was really

1322
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,520
magnificent um

1323
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,680
just just some comments on on this

1324
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,599
algorithmic management question the

1325
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,359
approach we've been taking and working

1326
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,480
for exchange is to to help workers to um

1327
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,640
to exercise their their access right so

1328
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,960
that we can pool the data and build a

1329
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,640
worker state of trust

1330
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,119
and but the other path of this is is

1331
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,200
understanding and making transparent

1332
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,960
algorithmic management and control and

1333
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,280
particularly automated decision making

1334
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,119
that relates to key areas like work

1335
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,680
allocation fairness and work allocation

1336
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,359
but also in terms of performance

1337
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,960
management and

1338
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,359
dismissals and so this question of the

1339
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,359
article 22 protections you have against

1340
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,440
automated decisions become critical

1341
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,280
because there is a kind of a get out

1342
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,880
clause that if there's a human in the

1343
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,800
loop then then

1344
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,440
then there's the protections drop away

1345
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,440
but the question is is that it's it's

1346
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,319
rarely um it's really uh binary it's

1347
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,760
very it's often that these are

1348
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,319
semi-automated decisions and you've got

1349
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,640
bots involved and you've got uh natural

1350
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,480
language programming

1351
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,800
techniques and giving a practical

1352
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,640
example of that which you can find in

1353
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,960
our in our report that we've just issued

1354
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,280
was a driver who you know couldn't get

1355
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,119
through he wasn't getting work allocated

1356
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,880
he knew something must be wrong with his

1357
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,200
profile and the only way he could get

1358
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,520
past these automated responses that were

1359
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,680
coming in messages was to threaten

1360
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,520
suicide he said i'm gonna go home and

1361
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,920
end it all if you don't answer me

1362
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,480
um and of course he he was kidding but

1363
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,319
he was what he was trying to do is break

1364
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,640
through these semi-automated responses

1365
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,400
uh which he did but they suspended them

1366
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,079
for a few weeks to check on the on his

1367
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,160
mental health but it gives you an idea

1368
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,040
of this sort of absurd uh world we enter

1369
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
into thank you so much aida that was

1370
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,760
fantastic and kate can i turn to you for

1371
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,319
a second um just to follow up on a few

1372
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,640
things but particularly i wanted to ask

1373
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,240
you about content creation um and the

1374
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,000
only fans

1375
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,200
uh

1376
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,280
situation i wonder if you had a minute

1377
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,599
to tell us a little bit about

1378
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,480
content creation worker rights in terms

1379
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,760
of content creation it was very

1380
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,079
interesting case a few years ago with uh

1381
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,119
ig metallin and youtubers but you know

1382
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,760
this seems to me only fans is the is the

1383
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,960
sex workers context for the struggle for

1384
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,280
control of of content

1385
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,720
sure i mean the only fans debacle

1386
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,760
really uncovers just how important

1387
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,400
destigmatization and decriminalization

1388
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,119
are

1389
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,480
because um even before only fans uh

1390
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,520
threatened to to ban porn entirely

1391
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,480
payment platforms were getting pressure

1392
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
pressure from prohibitionist

1393
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,520
organizations to stop um

1394
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,480
serving any anybody related to to sex

1395
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,160
workers so it's very hard to get a bank

1396
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,319
account it's very hard to receive

1397
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,200
payments from clients if they think that

1398
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,240
you um if you're a sex worker now again

1399
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,640
this is sort of hanging on the hook of

1400
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,000
preventing trafficking um though we need

1401
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,960
to say that you know that that um

1402
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,359
strategy around that needs to be more

1403
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,640
about safe immigration rights upon entry

1404
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,960
abolishing direct provision centers

1405
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,799
which are sort of institutionalized

1406
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,640
holding centers that we have in ireland

1407
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,880
with very substandard conditions where

1408
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,280
people are not allowed to work or make

1409
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,520
their own food and people end up

1410
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
engaging in sex work and those

1411
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,240
regularizing undocumented migrants

1412
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,079
creating firewalls for undocumented

1413
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,160
migrants to report to authorities these

1414
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,319
kinds of things however these payment

1415
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,160
platforms have started making it very

1416
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,559
difficult for us now in this shift of

1417
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,599
time proliferation of online work to be

1418
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,079
able to adapt um to to avail of of um of

1419
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,920
our new way of working which has been

1420
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,960
content creation so only fans of course

1421
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,520
which started as um i think a sort of

1422
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,040
knitting and baking platform but sex

1423
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,760
workers as we do be very ingenious in

1424
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,040
these kinds of ways

1425
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,720
you know discovered this would be a very

1426
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,799
good way for us to make money they got

1427
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,359
the pressure from the banks to stop

1428
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,599
taking um to stop taking us as users

1429
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,520
and so they um they threatened to to

1430
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,720
um to ban porn all together there was an

1431
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,760
outcry it frankly it probably was helped

1432
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,359
by the fact that it's become quite

1433
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,599
mainstream there would be sort of famous

1434
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:40,720
celebrities now who who who have only

1435
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,520
fans pages and they did end up

1436
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,240
backpedaling um

1437
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,839
however they they said that it was um a

1438
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,400
suspension so i mean realistically we

1439
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,319
can only think that it's been kicked

1440
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,119
down the road but you know for example

1441
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,599
um that this our need to unionize and to

1442
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,480
have decriminalization guardi here they

1443
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,200
they scrape our numbers from the only

1444
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
advertising site that is legal because

1445
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,799
it's held offshore

1446
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,359
and they have been making fake bookings

1447
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,400
with people

1448
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,400
um uh and

1449
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,200
in the name of doing welfare checks um

1450
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,720
and there have been a few people that

1451
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,520
have said that's nice to know uh thank

1452
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,799
you but for most people um they they

1453
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,400
find it very unsettling

1454
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,640
not only because um

1455
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,079
they want to know why guardian are

1456
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,160
looking at their numbers there they they

1457
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,079
are afraid that they will get evicted

1458
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,079
from their apartments which happens very

1459
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,559
often um they're afraid of their

1460
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,359
undocumented and and in the very least

1461
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,319
they're afraid that um gardy would camp

1462
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,839
outside of our places to arrest our

1463
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,280
clients which are our bread and butter

1464
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,440
so um it's very complicated again if we

1465
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,079
could have baseline decriminalization

1466
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,599
and legal ways of working at least we

1467
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,640
could be

1468
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,440
um

1469
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,040
more um part of the game of strategizing

1470
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,799
around how to be safe but right now it's

1471
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,880
just us hiding and being being afraid to

1472
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
engage with authorities at all

1473
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,880
so that's the debacle that happened with

1474
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,680
only fans and of course so many people

1475
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,720
joining and and and prices plummeting

1476
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,359
and

1477
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:18,720
things like that we want to be able to

1478
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,640
diversify you know

1479
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,119
yeah that's that well the familiar story

1480
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,599
again thank you uh so much for that we

1481
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,359
have a couple of comments here one from

1482
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,640
and we've got one minute left where we

1483
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,040
come from victor the portability means

1484
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,880
some sort of normalization between

1485
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,280
platforms um and that's not always

1486
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,200
feasible well well that's that's true in

1487
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,359
part uh victor but we're finding though

1488
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,319
that there is a high degree of um

1489
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,640
consistency with this type of data

1490
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,319
around uh geolocation data gps data

1491
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,280
fair income data and so on so

1492
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,599
the the core of that data is quite

1493
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,319
useful and fairly fairly common in in

1494
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,960
our experience in in running access

1495
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,760
requests and what is what may be

1496
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,400
different is the algorithmic control

1497
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,599
and the profiling um uh you know but

1498
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,160
that but that that's not um that's not

1499
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,240
covered within the scope of portability

1500
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,160
anyway um

1501
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,400
but point taken and jill also raised the

1502
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,640
panel at the point about

1503
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,319
this problem of um in-app communication

1504
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,680
that's promised within the eu directive

1505
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,920
could that concentrate more data within

1506
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,720
the the garden walls of the platform and

1507
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,520
and

1508
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,599
and allow for potentially union busting

1509
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,000
strategies potentially it could jill it

1510
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,440
also could have the other effect because

1511
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,119
a lot of unions when they are trying to

1512
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,319
get recognition agreements um try to uh

1513
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,640
negotiate for neutrality and access

1514
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,920
agreements access to the platform or to

1515
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,040
a building to recruit workers so i think

1516
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,359
idg for example the us is some kind of

1517
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,319
access

1518
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,400
agreement to the platform with uber so

1519
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,960
that uber at least distributes content

1520
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,680
through the app for them so

1521
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,839
it cuts both ways but i think it's down

1522
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,200
to the quality of the agreement and that

1523
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,760
can be reached but good points i think

1524
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,319
