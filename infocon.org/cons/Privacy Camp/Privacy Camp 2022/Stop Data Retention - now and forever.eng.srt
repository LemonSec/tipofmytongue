00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,680
little bit what we're gonna talk in this

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
room uh today uh

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
it's not a session where we're gonna

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
analyze what has been going on on data

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,480
retention um on the political and

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
legislative stages so to say there's

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
been already quite a few events about

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
like thinking what has been done in the

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,760
past years in terms of case law

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
in terms of litigation

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
by civil society groups now here we what

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,760
we want to do is really to focus on

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
action mobilization what can be done in

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
the next stages

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479
and in the next years as civil society

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,200
to combat new initiative

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
uh new

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,920
laws at national and eu levels that will

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
be proposed uh to maintain either data

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
retention regime that exists

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,400
or to propose new type of

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
mass surveillance

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
type of regimes

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
like in many eu countries now

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
the idea is that we collectively

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
brainstorm about

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
the next step or how civil society also

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
said he can mobilize uh people against

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
their attention

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,520
um it's still like a big

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
challenge when we think about data

42
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,719
retention uh and explain it to a

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,520
lay person on the street how it can

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
impact her or him

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
and this is something we need to

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
collectively think about because the

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,399
story is not

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
at the end unfortunately although we

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
thought it would

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
after the the last uh court of justice

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
uh

52
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
case law uh and case

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
um and for that we will reflect uh with

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
our speaker about the state of play

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
um we will think about what are the

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
current challenges what has changed in

57
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
the past 10 years or maybe 20 years on

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,400
this topic

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,640
how can we approach it from a different

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,680
perspective maybe to be more effective

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
um and for that maybe it's a good idea

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,840
that with our speakers we reflect on the

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,879
past

64
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
uh what we have done in the past that

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,480
has worked what has worked less uh how

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
we can improve things

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,400
and we can also start like brainstorming

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
collectively what what about what can we

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,519
be

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,239
doing in the future in the coming years

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,200
um

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,959
so for that

73
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
i will be accompanied by

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,720

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,759

us this morning and whether they can

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,160
participate uh in the brainstorm

105
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,039
um so i prepared some questions to you

106
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
if it's possible to share them in the

107
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,479
chat um

108
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,039
i directed myself to the yeah exactly

109
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,880
have you ever worked on their attention

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
yes or no

111
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,479
ah so uh

112
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,840
a third

113
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,639
approximately of the people of the

114
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,319
viewers have already worked on it

115
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,960
uh two two-third actually not

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
um

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
the next question then is dependent on

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the first question so i'm addressing the

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,720
the the one-third um

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,639
who already worked on data retention

121
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,319
with the second question i wanted to

122
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,360
know

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
like

124
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,240
how for how long have you worked on it

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
like is it like less than three five

126
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,840
years yeah you're

127
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
oh only one person could actually answer

128
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
this is too bad

129
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,880
that was too fast

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
sorry

131
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
no problem

132
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
this is the testing session

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,599
you haven't been told

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,479
too early in the morning exactly

135
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
so for those of you who already worked

136
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,199
on it

137
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,120
for how long have you been working on it

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,759
is interesting the the interest we have

139
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,639
is that because the in this question is

140
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,520
that

141
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
some of our speakers have really long

142
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
term experience i'm looking at you rena

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
and

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
some maybe less

145
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
and it's interesting because you're

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
coming from different perspective

147
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,400
different goals

148
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
okay uh among the people who said they

149
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,039
worked on it um

150
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
some of them

151
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
worked less than five years

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
uh

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
and more than ten years so we have like

154
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,440
the two extreme

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
uh it's not super representative

156
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
obviously but uh still interesting to

157
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
know and the last question for me was to

158
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,560
know

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
from which angle did you approach this

160
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,280
topic

161
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
um like was it mainly

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,799
like artistic engagement or was it like

163
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
more advocacy so if the

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
the last question could be asked hi

165
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
patrick

166
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,279
yeah everybody is here now

167
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,679
cool i'm just asking the last question

168
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,919
to

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
the people in the public who had the

170
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
chance to worked on data retention

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,420
before

172
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,560
[Music]

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
yeah so

174
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
what i wanted to know is

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
from those of you who worked on it and

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
it's fine if you didn't in the past

177
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
there's still a chance to catch up and

178
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
we need all the energy possible on this

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,959
topic but from those of you who worked

180
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,839
on that our attention before was it

181
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
where did you started working on it like

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
mainly advocacy working towards

183
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
legislative change mainly research maybe

184
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
in academia

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,040
mainly tech self-defense let's say like

186
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,279
finding solutions to

187
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
work against

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,080
the retention of your personal data

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
or mainly campaign you organize protests

190
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,920
on the streets again like on this topic

191
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
um or any other and if you have like

192
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
where you've done something other than

193
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
that

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
um please share it in this in the chat

195
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
i really encourage like all of you all

196
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
the viewers to

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
use the chat during the session to share

198
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,360
your experience and share maybe if even

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
if you haven't worked on data retention

200
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,800
but you've been

201
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,279
campaigning or working on a specific

202
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
topic related to surveillance

203
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
do not hesitate to to share it

204
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,760
uh once the results are in on the chat

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
uh i'll consult them and the speakers as

206
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
well but i think this is good for the

207
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
speakers to know who uh he's following

208
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,519
us

209
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,640
we could i i'm gonna actually head and

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
give the floor uh to patrick um because

211
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
the in the first stage i just wanted we

212
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
just wanted to

213
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,399
uh remind everybody what the state of

214
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
play is so we actually shared the same

215
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,079
level of knowledge about what has been

216
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
going on on data retention in the past

217
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,120
years

218
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
um so

219
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
i think it's good that we go over

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,640
uh

221
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
what happened uh we thought we won on it

222
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,000
we thought we had a big case we we

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,600
almost did it

224
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
uh and now actually it's starting all

225
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
over again why is

226
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
this topic still important today patrick

227
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
and could you

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,560
summarize for us the latest

229
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,839
political

230
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,480
steps we saw

231
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,959
of course good morning thank you for

232
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,200
organizing this panel and i'm glad that

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
we have

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
activists among our listeners so many

235
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
who have been engaged in in this fight

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
for so long as i can tell

237
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
from the poll so it's wonderful to be

238
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
having this panel and wonderful

239
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,279
panelists and um it's a good time to to

240
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
discuss data retention

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
just to remind you

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
what's so special about

243
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
data retention in comparison to storage

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,519
of other kinds of data it is just simply

245
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
information that reflects our daily

246
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
communications

247
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
and our daily movements

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,079
and also the ip addresses that we use on

249
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,279
the internet that can be used to

250
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,839
reconstruct our online activities

251
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,800
so

252
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
unlike with other data it is very

253
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
comprehensive it

254
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,959
exposes your social network it exposes

255
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,760
um

256
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
our personal connections and and

257
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
problems and possibly

258
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
um it allows

259
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
forecast your behavior to deduce

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,800
patterns movements etc so it's extremely

261
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
sensitive data and it's being retained

262
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
without any business need or any other

263
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,399
necessity to do so

264
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
so that's why

265
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,600
the european court of justice decided in

266
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
a landmark

267
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,160
decision a digital rights island

268
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,639
that it is

269
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,920
sorry i think we lost the image is it

270
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
better now

271
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
yeah and i think you worked out for a

272
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,279
few seconds just the last sentence where

273
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,079
okay

274
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
the the eu court of justice decided it's

275
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
not proportionate to

276
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
retain and and collect information about

277
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
the communications and locations of the

278
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
entire population

279
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,440
that are completely unconnected to any

280
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
crime whatsoever

281
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
just because they might be of interest

282
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,800
in the future

283
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,360
and that was really

284
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
a landmark decision but it was never

285
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
really implemented

286
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,079
except maybe in those countries where

287
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,079
the specific decision was taken but not

288
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
even there so in ireland for example

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
they still have indescribable data

290
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
retention in place

291
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,880
and um

292
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,560
so basically member states refused to

293
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
to heed it to implement it and the

294
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,199
commission refuses to enforce it because

295
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,639
the commission is of a different view

296
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
itself in fact even the european data

297
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
protection supervisor in those court

298
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,440
proceedings argued something along the

299
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
lines that

300
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,959
the retention is not the problem it's

301
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,680
about the axis which is not true because

302
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
the it's the retention that has the

303
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
chilling effect

304
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
the knowledge that

305
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
your communications your behavior could

306
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,120
be used against you that is what has the

307
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
chilling effect

308
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,560
and yet um member states ignored it and

309
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,000
challenged it

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,040
and

311
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,279
what happened was that they did actually

312
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,320
manage

313
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,839
that the court um watch it down

314
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
um it's just prudence in its case law

315
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
and in the latest decision

316
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,079
allowed for a measure of

317
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
of um

318
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,600
data retention

319
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
where in case of a threat to national

320
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,519
security

321
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
um which is used by france for example

322
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,639
to argue well we have a permanent threat

323
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
to our national security and so we'll

324
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
just retain everything all the time and

325
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,199
of course we'll allow prosecutors to use

326
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,160
it for prosecuting crime as well

327
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
they have allowed for the so-called

328
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
targeted data retention so you can

329
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
retain data in certain areas

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
and that is being used

331
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,279
by member states such as denmark or

332
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,399
belgium

333
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,600
um to have basically um you know 80

334
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
percent or 90 of the country covered

335
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,040
um with some reasons above average crime

336
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
rate that there are railway stations

337
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,800
whatever you have it

338
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
and

339
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
basically it means that in those

340
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
countries

341
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,240
um

342
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
people are nearly as exposed to having

343
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
the data retained as

344
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,600
according to the indiscriminate

345
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
and

346
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
also they allowed for indiscriminate

347
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
retention of ip addresses even so that

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,199
allows for reconstruction of um

349
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
of the online activities in combination

350
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
with the log files that are being kept

351
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,880
and

352
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,040
what happened last last year what was

353
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,360
revealed was that the commission

354
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
already released a paper to propose to

355
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
member states how they could bring back

356
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
data retention

357
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
in line with the court requirements by

358
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
interpreting them very extensively

359
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
and

360
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
the only reason why member states are

361
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
not enthusiastic about it is that they

362
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
basically would prefer to ignore the

363
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,639
code rulings altogether and go along

364
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,600
with the existing law indiscriminate and

365
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
for all data types

366
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
and

367
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,519
so there is a threat that despite some

368
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
positive developments such as in the

369
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
german coalition

370
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
treaty and agreement

371
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
that this data retention will be imposed

372
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
by way of the eu level on all member

373
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
states and that's why it's a really good

374
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
time to act now because this is at early

375
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
stages

376
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
the commission has collected feedback

377
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,800
from member states they are waiting for

378
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
a court decision on germany's data

379
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
retention regime that's coming up in the

380
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,320
next few months

381
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
and then they will act and it is clear

382
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
that the commission will propose

383
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
a maximum measure possible they actually

384
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,800
consider extending data retention to ott

385
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
services which would for the first time

386
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,839
include messaging services

387
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
possibly video a conferencing services

388
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,520
internet email etc

389
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
they could actually mandate

390
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,640
identification

391
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,079
so um

392
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
it could eliminate anonymous accounts

393
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,280
and that's all that is a real thread

394
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
that needs addressing so it's very

395
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,880
timely to be having this panel today

396
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,959
thank you so much patrick for the very

397
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,960
good summarize uh so we hear it well i

398
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
think what the commission is planning is

399
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
still very unknown and i'm not sure they

400
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,440
have a good idea themselves what they

401
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
want to do actually

402
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
but this is our to our advantage because

403
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,760
we can come and be prepared when

404
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
the proposal comes out

405
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,840
and in any case we need some

406
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,400
mobilization currently at national level

407
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
where member state are pushing

408
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
more or less for a renewed regime on

409
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
data retention

410
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
in their domestic laws

411
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
um before maybe we like

412
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,039
think about uh future action and what

413
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,120
can be done and learn a little bit from

414
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
la quadrature du net uh case i wanted to

415
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
turn to reyna rena you are an activist

416
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
like a really long-term activist in data

417
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
protection

418
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,679
you co-founded digital courage which had

419
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
a different name at the time um

420
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
and i'm not gonna try to pronounce

421
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
you funded the big brother awards uh and

422
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
you were also using arts at the time

423
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
to um

424
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,840
to fight against a surveillance issue in

425
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
germany and i wanted to learn and i

426
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,960
think a lot of people in in the public

427
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
could learn from your experience and all

428
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
your uh

429
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,320
past mobilization um could you tell us a

430
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,480
little bit more how you became active on

431
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
the topic what did you do it was in the

432
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,160
2000 if i'm not mistaken um can you tell

433
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
us a little bit more how did you

434
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,559
organize how did you find partners uh

435
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,559
what did you do and

436
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,480
what do you think were your main

437
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,440
victories

438
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,799
hey yes

439
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,760
sure it's a pleasure

440
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,160
actually we started back in 1987

441
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,039
and

442
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
that was

443
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
the decade where um

444
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
the

445
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,480
big census in germany

446
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
uh should have happened which

447
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,600
then led to the constitutional court

448
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,840
ruling for

449
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,679
informational self-determination which

450
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,960
is a really important ruling

451
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,720
and everything else

452
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
relies on that

453
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,840
in terms of data protection law

454
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,880
so that was the time when a lot of

455
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,440
people were active on this and we had

456
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
demonstrations and so on in the in the

457
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,640
80s against the census

458
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
um

459
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
well um

460
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
um i should mention that i'm not doing

461
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
artwork to make something pretty

462
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,919
uh and have a

463
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,880
cool

464
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
uh thing to show

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
for uh for demonstrations but

466
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,200
um

467
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
our concept of art is different we um

468
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
we rely actually on the french composer

469
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,440
eric certi

470
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
uh his music was not meant to listen to

471
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
but to have it in the background and

472
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
create a good atmosphere so everyone

473
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
feels comfortable

474
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
and

475
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,720
it's

476
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
actually the music

477
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,000
tries to be boring

478
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,880
so you are not distracted but you come

479
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
to the point where you want to be active

480
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,919
yourself

481
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,120
so

482
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,799
this in very short the artistic concept

483
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,240
um we applied also to political

484
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
uh and legal situations

485
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
which also create a room where you find

486
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
yourself comfortable

487
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,320
and wanting to to uh

488
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,840
[Music]

489
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
to contribute something

490
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,799
or you think you should rather

491
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,000
stay quiet and don't do anything that

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
attracts attention

493
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,960
and we think in a democracy we need uh

494
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,520
people to to feel comfortable to to

495
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,760
to feel

496
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,520
confident uh to participate in in in in

497
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,159
the democratic process

498
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,559
and people can't do that when they feel

499
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
under surveillance all the time

500
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,760
so that in very short is the artistic

501
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,720
background of what we do

502
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
um

503
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,240
well about data so we worked for

504
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
data protection privacy already since 87

505
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,120
but

506
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,159
on data retention this started in

507
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,559
december 2005.

508
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,679
um

509
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,320
there the directive

510
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,559
came into place and

511
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,840
we had a first meeting

512
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,520
different people from different

513
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
organizations and also individuals at

514
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
the chaos communication congress this is

515
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,200
the the biggest uh

516
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
hacker

517
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
meeting

518
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,200
and that was taking place in um

519
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
i'm not sure was it hamburg or berlin

520
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
already i'm not sure

521
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
maybe it was berlin

522
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,240
um and um

523
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
they're very different people came from

524
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,240
the

525
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
critical

526
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
people against globalization of attack

527
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
there were people of the hackers from

528
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,480
the chaos computer club

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,200
and there were data protection officials

530
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,559
actually taking were taking part

531
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,679
and

532
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,120
some activists and this group decided

533
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
we have to do something on data

534
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
retention because this has the potential

535
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,000
to be really threatening for everybody

536
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,060
as you can

537
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,799
[Music]

538
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
you can figure out what someone is doing

539
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
because you can follow them their

540
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,440
location

541
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
all their social networks as patrick

542
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,600
explained already

543
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
so

544
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
um

545
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
there was a mailing list was created

546
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
and we decided we have to work together

547
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,520
and that was great because

548
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,600
more organizations and more individuals

549
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,039
joined in

550
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,640
and the interesting thing is

551
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,679
that

552
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,559
we were successful to

553
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,799
uh to make people understand that

554
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,330
everybody is really

555
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,279
[Music]

556
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
is affected

557
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,440
so we had um

558
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,240
uh groups uh joining in

559
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
uh you would not expect there by like uh

560
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,640
doctors

561
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
uh journalists lawyers

562
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,720
also therapists and

563
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,080
we had the

564
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,240
um aids hiv counseling the telephone

565
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
counseling of the protestant church in

566
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
germany and so on because they all saw

567
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:18,880
that

568
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,200
it has a chilling effect when people

569
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
can't call

570
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
a counseling line like like this

571
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
um

572
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
when they think this is all recorded uh

573
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
that the fact that they have been

574
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
calling there allows

575
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,720
the um

576
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,000
that you think

577
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,799
they might be ill or something or have a

578
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,120
psychological problem

579
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,320
so i think one of the secrets of the

580
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
success was that we

581
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,760
actually

582
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,720
were

583
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,279
successful to attract a lot of different

584
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,000
organizations that were opposing data

585
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,640
retention for different reasons

586
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,679
and

587
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,279
we started

588
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
organizing demonstrations

589
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
the

590
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,039
the really big demonstration that was

591
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,480
taking place

592
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
several years

593
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
was called freiheit state angst

594
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
in german and

595
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,679
this is

596
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
where the uh freedom not fear

597
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080

comes from

600
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,080
um

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,920
freedom not fear um

freyja angst means

604
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,480
we don't want to be protected don't uh

605
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,200
make us fearful

606
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,080
and pretend you want to protect us

607
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,679
we think democracy and freedom is

608
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,640
more to protect we we protect it and

609
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,320
keep away from us

610
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,960
and um we actually

611
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
um were successful to bring people of

612
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
very different political backgrounds

613
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,799
together

614
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,790
we had um

615
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,200
[Music]

616
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
people from the left the greens the

pirate party

618
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,840
um and uh the liberals uh the free

619
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,960
democrats of germany

620
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,480
uh at the same time there were the

621
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,120
anti-capitalist block there and uh

622
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,080
uh

623
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
a block of doctors that came in white in

624
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
their white coats and uh

625
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,559
so it was very colorful and a lot of

626
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,880
creative action of people who protested

627
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
and people

628
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,240
founded local groups

629
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
and

630
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
that organized events in their town and

631
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,159
made info stands in the pedestrian areas

632
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,360
and

633
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,919
so there was a lot of engagement

634
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,600
um

635
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,760
also because we had a common uh goal for

636
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,960
uh

637
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,919
in the first place to stop uh data

638
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
retention

639
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
uh by the way of the constitutional

640
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,640
complaint

641
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
uh patrick

642
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,080
really earns the uh the credits for this

643
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,400
because i think he wrote most of the uh

644
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,279
text of the constitutional complaint in

645
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,080
cooperation with meiner sterostic our

646
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,399
lawyer

647
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,080
which sadly died uh some years ago uh he

648
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,120
was a fantastic person and he he was

649
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
always engaged in

650
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
defending freedom

651
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,120
and civil rights yeah that was you see

652
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
patrick in one of the early

653
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,240
demonstrations

654
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,799
uh making a talk next to paduloon of the

655
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,240
guitar coverage

656
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,440
and

657
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,760
we started with 250 people at the

658
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,000
demonstration at the next

659
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,919
there was something like 500 and then

660
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,200
more than 1 000 and then we have at

661
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,000
fifteen thousand and uh then at some

662
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,799
time um we had uh

663
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,039
um we had uh fifty thousand and uh that

664
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,240
was just a fantastic

665
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
experience to see that here you see

666
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,840
people of um abbey sky swordstart

667
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,760
that's a free group with no

668
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
it's no association

669
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,799
in the leader sense but it was a free

670
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,440
association of people the local groups

671
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440
uh always called themselves awaits

672
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,279
foreign or berlin or whatever and we had

673
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,039
a lot of them

674
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,520
uh yeah we had uh uh quite a number of

675
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,039
demonstrations that is also in berlin

676
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,240
um

677
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,279
and

678
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,559
but um

679
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,399
a lot of local

680
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
initiatives um

681
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,039
uh who did things

682
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,360
i would not have recommended i would

683
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,559
have thought as as an experienced

684
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,720
activist this does not work

685
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,600
for instance people

686
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,760
carried a coffin

687
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
around

688
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,640
and said

689
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,840
to to show we bury democracy we bury

690
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
fundamental riots

691
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,520
and we thought this is so boring people

692
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,440
have done that in the 70s you know but

693
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,559
most people don't remember this so um

694
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,880
it actually worked to attract attention

695
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
and this coffin was carried around

696
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,360
hamburg i think that was

697
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,240
and so a lot of creativity and and

698
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,600
actions and uh to to activate people

699
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
happened and that was that was great and

700
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,919
um

701
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,520
of course um

702
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,919
collecting signatures um

703
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,760
for the um

704
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,320
complaint was a big thing

705
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,880
as people saw they can

706
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
actually have an impact

707
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,679
when they support this constitutional

708
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
complaint and we collected these

709
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,640
signatures not like these organizations

710
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,159
who do that online but people gave their

711
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,360
real-life signature on paper

712
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,090
as

713
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,880
[Music]

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,000
it's

715
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,799
i don't know the the term the exact term

716
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,080
to give the lawyer uh um

717
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
uh the um

718
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,880
uh

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
to apply in

722
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
in their name at the court so

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,919
uh and this this was the biggest mass uh

724
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,880
constitutional complaint we had almost

725
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,440
35 000 people

726
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,080
who signed this and

727
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,320
so we have been uh bringing um uh

728
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,279
really

729
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,679
a lot of paper to the constitutional

730
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,240
court for who were the plaintiffs

731
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,760
uh at this court and um no please go

732
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
back in the picture frank

733
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,760
um

734
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,240
look at this uh this is potsdamer platz

735
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,279
in berlin you can see how many people uh

736
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,600
attended these demonstrations

737
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,640
and

738
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,519
the speaker there is tilo weihert who is

739
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,559
a

740
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,360
data protection officer

741
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
of schleswig-holstein

742
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,480
and

743
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,720
there were masses of people and it was a

744
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
great feeling for everybody to see we

745
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,200
are not alone and i think this is the

746
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,200
main learning uh to see we can actually

747
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,600
move something we can have an impact we

748
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,519
can change things

749
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,799
and

750
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,600
a demonstration does not only show this

751
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,880
to other people to politicians but also

752
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,760
to

753
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,159
any people who are active to see they

754
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,880
are not alone this is a very important

755
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,840
function also of a

756
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,720
demonstration um

757
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
well if we uh

758
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
jump on to the next picture frank

759
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
that

760
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
that was in

761
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
at the

762
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,519
european court

763
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,600
and i have been attending

764
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,880
this in 2013.

765
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,799
i traveled there and the german

766
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
television was there with me that was

767
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,559
quite fun

768
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,360
and i wanted comments on this

769
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,720
this was the the ruling against the

770
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
directive on data retention and

771
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,480
i could not believe how

772
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
um

773
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,440
how harsh

774
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,519
the judges

775
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,919
were dealing with these government

776
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,600
officials and

777
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
trying to get information from them

778
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,519
why do you have

779
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,279
data retention why do you think it's

780
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,320
useful

781
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,120
and as an example of the austrian

782
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,480
government said we had 1 000 no no we

783
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,960
had 120 cases

784
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,480
more or less um we had we have used data

785
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
retention on we couldn't have solved

786
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
them otherwise

787
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,360
and the judges

788
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,720
asked

789
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
what was the uh what were the crimes

790
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,480
and uh the guy of the austrian

791
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,360
government said well it was uh

792
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,799
let me see um it was fraud uh dealing

793
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,760
with stolen goods drug trafficking and

794
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,080
insulting other people

795
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
and the judge said

796
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
did you have any terrorism

797
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,240
cases

798
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,279
and the austrian guy said

799
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,960
no i can't see any and the um then the

800
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,519
judge said and you have used data

801
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,720
retention on cases of insult

802
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
uh really

803
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,600
and the austrian guy said yes because we

804
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,840
had the data

805
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,559
anyway

806
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,279
so we just used it and so

807
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,039
i could not believe that he actually

808
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
said that because he couldn't have given

809
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
us a better

810
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,080
uh

811
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
argument on that

812
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
um there of the function creep then when

813
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,039
when the data has been collected it will

814
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,159
be used um because it's there and uh

815
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
people organizations and also

816
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,279
corporations might get hold of the data

817
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,600
as soon as it's collected

818
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,679
something like this will happen

819
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,918
so um

820
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,820
yeah um

821
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,159
[Music]

822
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,879
i was astonished how they

823
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,839
the judges were

824
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,280
there dealing with the government

825
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,159
officials and

826
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,480
other activists said oh this does not

827
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,918
mean anything

828
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,679
they will

829
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,918
they will not do anything important in

830
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,159
the end but i was very happy to learn

831
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,760
afterwards that they actually decided uh

832
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,079
that the the european directive was not

833
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,918
um uh in terms with the european charter

834
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,440
of fundamental rights yes um

835
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,679
a very positive outcome in the end of

836
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,599
the of your campaign so maybe yeah

837
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
this picture is uh showing uh us also

838
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,520
you can see patrick again

839
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,000
we are on the went mainarch touristic is

840
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,560
the guy with the orange scarf uh our

841
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,079
lawyer and we are on the way um uh the

842
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,320
second time to the constitutional court

843
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
because uh

844
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,880
the

845
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
data retention

846
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,560
is in place now again

847
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,359
and just one point i want to make

848
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,170
is

849
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,520
[Music]

850
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,760
that in the first ruling of the

851
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,320
constitutional court the court said it's

852
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,400
unconstitutional and void the german law

853
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,520
on data retention but they did not say

854
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
data retention can't be done

855
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,400
as such

856
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,440
so under certain conditions it could be

857
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,520
uh there could be a law for data

858
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,640
retention

859
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,280
but they said um there have been them

860
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
there are certain conditions you can't

861
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,920
rule the um the data retention law just

862
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,200
um

863
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,680
as such you have to look at the context

864
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,640
are there other laws in place

865
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
and when there is more surveillance in

866
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,560
place then citizens will feel under

867
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
surveillance all the time and this is

868
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,400
not uh possible in a democracy

869
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
so um

870
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,880
the the term that was coined then is uh

871
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,400
uh

872
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
this means uh

873
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
overall account of current surveillance

874
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,000
laws uh

875
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,119
so uh the politicians have to uh take an

876
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,960
um in account

877
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
that uh

878
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
how

879
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,599
how many other laws are there uh for

880
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,720
surveillance and can't decide for

881
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,920
another law adding surveillance to this

882
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,800
and what we have done is we made a list

883
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,240
uh uh

884
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,480
of all the laws that

885
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,240
were added on this since 2010

886
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,839
this is when the constitutional court

887
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,400
said no it's uh it's unconstitutional

888
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
and

889
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,960
this was a tedious work but

890
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,240
in the end

891
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
the liberal party

892
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,240
foundation took up the work and

893
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,680
this ended up in the german coalition

894
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,599
contract so

895
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,240
in germany when new laws are

896
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,599
decided on

897
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,480
they

898
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,359
the

899
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,520
german bundestag must take in into

900
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,480
account

901
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,960
uh what the total accounting of

902
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
surveillance laws is

903
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,520
and uh it's mentioned in the coalition

904
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,280
contract and i think this is a big

905
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,359
success

906
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,160
okay i think i am

907
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,760
make a point here

908
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,560
and you can ask anything indeed

909
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
of course you can ask any question to

910
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,640
rena and patrick already uh thank you so

911
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,720
much for this rendition of all the work

912
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,480
you've done since uh

913
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,359
the late 90s actually and i think this

914
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,760
is already shows a lot of great uh

915
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,240
lessons or takeaway we can do for this

916
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,280
session

917
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
like i understand that it was a

918
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,359
combination of different action of

919
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,800
different types of action it was

920
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
advocacy with the list you just

921
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
mentioned showcasing how many

922
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
surveillance laws were already in place

923
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,720
it was about litigation bringing

924
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,119
actually the case in front of courts

925
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,160
uh asking for a review of the legality

926
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,200
of those laws but in the end also

927
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
showcasing

928
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,119
uh your power by bringing people to the

929
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,359
streets in numbers

930
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,520
and that is very impressive

931
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
as well as actually bringing different

932
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,040
people

933
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,800
around the table and

934
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,839
um

935
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,160
highlighting their voice bringing their

936
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,560
voice to the table those who we don't

937
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,599
think at first might be affected but are

938
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,839
in direct line so that's already very

939
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,000
inspiring i think for the

940
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,520
for how we could design uh our own next

941
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,160
uh action in this field i want to turn

942
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,200
to nuemi who has more uh recent

943
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,040
experience knowing me is member of la

944
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,240
cuadro dinet another edgary member so

945
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,720
such as uh dikital kuraj

946
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
this is our member in france and now

947
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,119
naomi is also the legal advisor i would

948
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,040
uh translate it this way

949
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
in english of la guaracher

950
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
recently joined the team and we are very

951
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,240
happy to have her this morning and she

952
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,720
also was part of the litigation team at

953
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
la cuaracho

954
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
when the case uh the french law was

955
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
brought

956
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
uh to just well in front of courts and

957
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
it ended up in this uh

958
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,880
uh now famous landmark ruling i would

959
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
say at the court of justice

960
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,839
uh obviously the aftermath was very

961
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,880
disappointing for you guys um i wanted

962
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,839
to know

963
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,040
that the reason for that is the

964
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
constitution actually circumvented the

965
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,960
whole kind of conclusion from the court

966
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,520
of justice and i wanted to know how like

967
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,599
when ratio

968
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,320
lived through this journey uh what did

969
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
you learn guys what was the positive

970
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,920
aspect what was the

971
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,079
kind of the defeat or the the negative

972
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,920
things you wouldn't done it wouldn't

973
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,680
have done again

974
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,839
and what are for you the the next step

975
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,920
after this disappointment how you pass

976
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
that feeling and how are you going to

977
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,720
continue

978
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,759
working on this topic

979
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,640
well hello thank you for the invitation

980
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,599
first

981
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,760
uh well actually yes with quadrature we

982
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,880
we challenged this topic only on a

983
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,520
litigation aspect uh

984
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
and to resume it was long it was a long

985
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,599
fight

986
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,960
and i think what we can say now it's

987
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,280
we have a big a very

988
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,520
uh

989
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,280
sensitive example of how politics and

990
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
law and litigation can interfere because

991
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,839
when we first

992
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,240
went before the judge i actually the

993
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,800
starting point was the digital right

994
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,440
island decision that patrick brayer uh

995
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,839
talked about and for us it was

996
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,319
really great it was a material and

997
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,440
substantial argument to to

998
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
show the judge to

999
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
to challenge the legality of such of

1000
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
such retention and access

1001
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,720
of data and so we went uh on

1002
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
first time before the judge we were

1003
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,200
actually ruled out because

1004
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,520
we were actually the council of states

1005
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
say that we were misinterpreted

1006
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
the digital island decision so we had to

1007
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,280
wait for the td2 ruling to go back

1008
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,640
and then it was long because why i say

1009
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,359
we there are interference with politics

1010
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,440
is that at the same time there was

1011
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,640
negotiation on the e-privacy regulation

1012
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,880
in brazil and

1013
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
so we know that friends have had a big

1014
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,480
part on it so

1015
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,440
in our action before the judge at that

1016
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,359
time really stopped during two or three

1017
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,520
years because the council of state knew

1018
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
that there was some interest

1019
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,280
in resells and

1020
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,560
so

1021
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,920
we had to wait until 2018

1022
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
to have our preliminary ruling uh

1023
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
transmitted to the court but again we

1024
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,160
saw that the council state didn't do

1025
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,680
this

1026
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,319
just to enforce the law the the way of

1027
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,560
turning the question the way of drafting

1028
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
the preliminary ruling really asked the

1029
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,839
court to

1030
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,800
change its position so

1031
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,599
all that time we were quite happy of

1032
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
course with that little ruling but we

1033
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,599
were all we knew also that there was so

1034
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,160
much interest there that this topic is

1035
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
so sensitive when you talk about police

1036
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,720
and terrorism so

1037
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,280
so we we were really waiting for this

1038
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,560
decision

1039
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,359
and

1040
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,880
actually when uh the goal of justin's

1041
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,400
decision uh

1042
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,960
came out in 2020

1043
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,839
we had kind of mixed feelings because as

1044
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,079
patrick brewer said it was

1045
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,000
creating exemptions

1046
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,680
so it was for us kind of weaker a weaker

1047
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,920
decision weaker position than the td2

1048
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
ruling but we also believed at the time

1049
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,680
that france

1050
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
french law was going to change because

1051
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,400
it didn't comply with this decision and

1052
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,880
so as you said the council of sale so

1053
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,720
which is actually for those who don't

1054
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,280
know the french higher administrative

1055
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,160
court

1056
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,280
will

1057
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,240
interpreted it in a way that nothing

1058
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,359
changed so it twisted the exception to

1059
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,240
make

1060
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
uh

1061
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,440
the retention and access actually

1062
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,839
permanent and as petroglyphs said the

1063
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,640
exemption of threat to national security

1064
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,560
was used to say that we are in a

1065
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,880
permanent threat a permanent state of

1066
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,280
emergency and so that the police and the

1067
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,040
intelligence services

1068
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,160
should

1069
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
access should should have the same power

1070
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,599
than before so

1071
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,000
what our feelings of of course who were

1072
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,960
disappointed but we were also facing the

1073
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,839
limit of litigation as

1074
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,079
the the countryside didn't actually

1075
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,200
enforce the load didn't enforce what we

1076
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,920
have been doing for decades which is uh

1077
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,839
make prevail european law on french law

1078
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,599
and so

1079
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,119
it's more than a disappointment it's

1080
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,240
also a loss of faith in this institution

1081
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,079
even i don't know if we had too much

1082
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,400
faith but now we don't have

1083
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
any more and how

1084
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,599
actually

1085
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
the police and the intelligence services

1086
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,359
can have so much influence and maybe

1087
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,560
it's

1088
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,800
very specific also to

1089
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,280
how friends works because i think it can

1090
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
be different in in different member

1091
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,359
states because in france this concealer

1092
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,920
state is not uh

1093
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,760
made of classical uh judge the judge

1094
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,040
came out from a school that trained also

1095
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,280
the higher executives that go into

1096
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,440
ministries so it's the same people that

1097
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,480
actually

1098
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,000
judge our case and that also advise the

1099
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,720
politics so it's a few hundred of people

1100
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,000
who are in the higher uh position of all

1101
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
institutions so

1102
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,680
i think what we

1103
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,440
after all this year

1104
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,920
all this year sorry what we

1105
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,960
uh

1106
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
recall and what we were in face of is

1107
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,280
that really something cannot ever change

1108
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,400
and this institution has hundreds of

1109
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,280
years

1110
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,760
exit have existed for a hundred years

1111
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,960
have very prestigious and historical

1112
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,400
past and so we believe that with our

1113
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,800
legal argument with our european law we

1114
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,480
could make

1115
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,520
the makes things change and actually

1116
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,800
we could not

1117
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,119
and that's how that's why we were

1118
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,119
disappointed and actually

1119
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,440
like almost a year later

1120
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,200
we still don't know what we're gonna do

1121
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,960
we we

1122
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,520
know that litigation cannot be used

1123
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,440
maybe to such

1124
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,720
big subjects we will still use it for

1125
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,440
smaller case or individual case but

1126
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,319
that's also what's sad is that we were

1127
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,520
trying to

1128
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,640
to make uh to defend a collective

1129
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,319
subject the collective cause and maybe

1130
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,160
now we have to go back to more

1131
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,079
individual protection

1132
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:18,880
uh

1133
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,839
to

1134
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,680
tell people how they can protect their

1135
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,800
privacy or maybe to go do litigation on

1136
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,440
specific criminal individual case we

1137
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
were still thinking about it

1138
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,359
uh because

1139
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,680
it has been i think it was six years

1140
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,960
fight and we went to the highest it's

1141
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,720
the highest body in the european union

1142
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,839
so we

1143
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,720
at least maybe we could go before the

1144
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
european court of human rights but there

1145
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,440
are also a lot of limitations to go

1146
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,640
before this this judge we could uh there

1147
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,880
are also the option

1148
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,839
of

1149
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,480
asking the commission to prosecute

1150
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,800
friends but where we cannot do it

1151
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,640
ourselves and that's

1152
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,520
that's a shame in european law because

1153
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,880
we depend on a political body to

1154
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,000
to uh

1155
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,680
to to do this action

1156
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,960
of failure

1157
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,920
so

1158
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,640
actually we are making maybe a pose

1159
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,680
on the

1160
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,920
on litigation and that was really

1161
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,800
interesting to see reyna reyna's

1162
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,200
history of activism because we are also

1163
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,240
thinking

1164
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,640
maybe of doing a mix between litigation

1165
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,800
and then going on the street or may or

1166
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
or doing some as i said training

1167
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,160
or also tell people and

1168
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,520
the people that they make them aware of

1169
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,319
uh

1170
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,119
of where their data is going because now

1171
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,000
that we lose that we lost sorry

1172
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,079
well you have to be aware that if you

1173
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,160
have a phone you have always you're

1174
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,040
always

1175
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,520
tracked with your location so

1176
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,200
yeah maybe sometimes

1177
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,680
not take it and it's a shame to go this

1178
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,920
far but today we cannot

1179
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,800
well the fight for the law is lost so we

1180
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,520
have to go back to individual protection

1181
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,760
and so that that's some stuff we we were

1182
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,079
thinking about also maybe

1183
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,680
uh before the french decision we were we

1184
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
were

1185
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,640
pushing to

1186
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,400
to entertune

1187
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
and force uh european law

1188
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,280
instead of a french so for example in

1189
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,599
we have some social network we host some

1190
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,920
social network and we're saying we only

1191
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,559
keep the logs and the data a few weeks

1192
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,559
because we have that little ruling and

1193
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,040
we want to enforce this decision but now

1194
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,359
that the french flow is clear well we

1195
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,079
can

1196
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,400
maybe still do it but we we put

1197
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,599
ourselves at risk but it's also a way of

1198
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,200
activism to

1199
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
to

1200
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,040
actually not applies at all but

1201
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,280
with of course all the limits it has so

1202
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,119
we're thinking about all this doing a

1203
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:57,920
mix

1204
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,160
of uh of the of all the square of

1205
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,440
activism

1206
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,000
and if we i actually if we had to do it

1207
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,200
all again

1208
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,160
all over

1209
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,359
today

1210
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,920
uh i don't know if we knew that it was

1211
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
going to end this way i think we will

1212
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,960
not go

1213
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,240
because uh

1214
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,640
because we were thinking that french law

1215
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,280
will would apply and enforce european

1216
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,480
law so

1217
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,319
actually it's it's a very difficult

1218
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,240
question uh

1219
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,079
maybe we we would do

1220
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,160
more specifically maybe we will do all

1221
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,880
of the same again because

1222
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,440
that also may shed light on this topic

1223
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,920
in france and uh

1224
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,400
we are waiting to see how this decision

1225
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,720
is going to be teached in law school

1226
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,440
because there were a lot of noise and

1227
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
fuss about about it

1228
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,880
here so

1229
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,440
we still have mixed feelings uh we are

1230
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
happy to

1231
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,440
that we went all through this journey

1232
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,000
but uh but it's very difficult and as

1233
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
you said in the beginning of the of the

1234
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,079
talk we have to do it all over again we

1235
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,800
had we thought we won and then

1236
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,839
maybe we have to to

1237
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,400
see and observe what was what was going

1238
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,800
on in every member state in the in the

1239
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,359
few years what the commission is going

1240
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,800
to propose

1241
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,200
but uh it's not

1242
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,920
as

1243
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,520
as it did is also kind of an attack to

1244
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,520
european union law and it has done

1245
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,160
quite the same uh twice in the last year

1246
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,839
i think that's why i said at the

1247
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,240
beginning there are a lot of politics

1248
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,839
and there are there is a tension right

1249
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,839
now between france and european

1250
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,680
union well that's what we saw so of

1251
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,440
course maybe we have to have this in

1252
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,480
mind

1253
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,119
and wait until it pass or wait until we

1254
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,359
have some more idea or wait until we

1255
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,280
know how to attack it but of course we

1256
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,119
won't give up it's just that

1257
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,520
uh such such a big

1258
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,160
big event like like we had

1259
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,680
uh makes as a as activists questions of

1260
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,559
where of are going to a subject and we

1261
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,079
made all our efforts all of our energy

1262
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,160
into litigation and maybe

1263
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,599
we just have to wait and put our energy

1264
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,839
into something else before before coming

1265
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,920
back but thank you very much for

1266
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,440
for the cheering

1267
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,640
in the

1268
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,400
arrangement absolutely deserved uh

1269
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
there is a question about exactly maybe

1270
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,839
knowing me you want to just respond

1271
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,680
directly um there's a que another

1272
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,200
question from freedom and about like

1273
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,440
whether what do you think the court of

1274
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
justice will do when it sees that

1275
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,359
there's such a

1276
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,880
almost wrong

1277
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,920
reaction to its own uh court case uh

1278
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,680
what do you think the reaction would be

1279
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,480
and louisa also had a question um to

1280
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,119
which uh patrick archery answered in the

1281
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,559
chat

1282
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,520
about italy as well uh

1283
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,880
um

1284
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,680
obliging retention of metadata for over

1285
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,440
four or six years i think and the

1286
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,200
commission is not still taking action so

1287
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,559
we are pointing again to the same

1288
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,880
direction of there is the commission and

1289
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,440
this is a deadlock it refuses to do its

1290
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,079
role under the treaty uh like as a

1291
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,040
guardian of the treaty um is there

1292
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,280
is this a point where we need to focus

1293
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,319
on um i'm asking to all the speakers and

1294
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,240
we have five minutes left so please be

1295
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,558
brief

1296
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,200
i can start quickly on freezing

1297
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,359
questions uh actually it's something

1298
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,079
we're looking at and it's interesting to

1299
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,400
see that in the latest uh general

1300
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,079
advocates conclusion on a segment

1301
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,640
on the same topic saying that it's okay

1302
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,720
we know we know where the case law is

1303
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,440
stop asking questions so maybe the court

1304
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,040
is going to

1305
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,680
to go

1306
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,319
on and on are saying the same position

1307
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,280
and that could uh weaken uh member

1308
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,000
states like friends who are who has a

1309
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,559
very narrow interpretation so

1310
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,880
uh what's going to be interesting too is

1311
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,119
to see if the commission do something to

1312
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,880
enforce this position

1313
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,319
uh if

1314
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,800
if the commission is going to wait to uh

1315
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,599
citizens to seize it or

1316
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,559
or if it's going to do some action for

1317
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,680
failure by itself so i think it's uh as

1318
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,839
i said there is a moment of tension

1319
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,880
right now maybe in european union about

1320
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,520
enforcing law and uh it's only the

1321
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,720
beginning so we have a part parts

1322
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,680
to play

1323
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,000
in there

1324
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,440
any final word

1325
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,319
from patrick organa

1326
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,720
before we close the session it's too

1327
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,160
short

1328
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,880
yeah

1329
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
that's what i was going to say uh we can

1330
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,400
tell that we are running out of time

1331
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,920
before we've had

1332
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,839
the opportunity to discuss everything

1333
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,599
and talk with our

1334
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,920
audience and so i think it will make

1335
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,280
sense to um to keep in touch and

1336
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,000
have

1337
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,800
more meetings and um

1338
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,319
continue the the networking to

1339
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,200
see

1340
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,640
internationally what are the

1341
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,559
developments and how can we challenge

1342
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,640
there's a great thing listed andrea i'm

1343
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,599
sure clearly we'll go into that and um

1344
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,599
we will also

1345
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,920
continue our work and try to bring

1346
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,000
people on this and um

1347
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,640
let's as lena said let's be really uh

1348
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,240
persistent and a pain in the neck

1349
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,400
very great words of conclusion yes

1350
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,000
indeed if you want to support

1351
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,520
a network a

1352
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,000
transnational civil society mobilization

1353
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,400
as louisa put it in the chat you can

1354
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,720
join uh as you remember

1355
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,680

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,240
mind for the next year

1365
