1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,000
server is a virtual machine in a data

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,960
center but also has a public interface

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,759
in

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,960
kalafoo

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,480
sister server is a bare battle uh metal

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,439
uh machine that goes back to

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
the her story of the gender changers

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,960
which uh was

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
mainly focused on self education and

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,119
uh

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
uh based on identity politics

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,120
and lever burns is a bare metal micro

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,239
machine

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
and yes if you visit it uh you have to

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,000
allow

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,040
the risk

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
there is no certificate

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
but it is trustworthy because we know

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,760
who is

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,879
running

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,480
the server

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
so we call ourselves feminist servers

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,600
with distributed

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
services and

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,000
we inhabit uh effective

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
infrastructures

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
and maybe some people would ask

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
themselves

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
what is this

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
a feminist server

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
and i think it's good

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,640
to uh read

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,360
the feminist server manifesto 0.0.1

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,799
uh it's from the feminist server

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,080
summit

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,920
already a couple of years ago and some

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,520
of us also

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,119
were involved in the

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
transact feminist event in

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,439
kalafoo each of these servers

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,759
will define themselves differently and

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,799
have different ways to

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
create

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
the narrative

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,439
and

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,600
each of us also have

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
speculative

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,079
future

49
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,280
futures

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
so this panel advocates for a feminist

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
internet and

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
the need

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
to empower

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,119
its communities

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,920
however our communities lack

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
structural resources to enable feminist

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,399
hosting platforms

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
to become sustainable in a longer term

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
so we ask together in this panel why and

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
how to

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
um so hello

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,959
we are ooo we are part as a moderator

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
for this panel and also

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,760
mara is

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,319

himself in a little two minutes

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,840
and uh also give resonance uh to uh the

72
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
topic of

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
the panel so we would like to invite uh

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
nobody else was but i'm happy to

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,720
while i'm speaking anyway so um thanks

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,680
very much for inviting me to this panel

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
um it's been really nice to

89
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
to organize this i'm talking about

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,720
feminist servers is one of my

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,159
favorite topics so i think that's why um

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,640
i resonated with this uh i myself have

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,159
been a systems administrator for um over

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
10 years um

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,280
working on a not overtly feminist

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
projects always

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,080
um

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,959
and

99
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
you know currently i'm

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,920
the chief technology officer in um

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
washington dc at the center for

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
democracy technology

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,239
um it's not an overt feminist project

104
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,640
but there are ways that we can always

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
find

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,480
um you know small small things to work

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
on together that that intersect with

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
that so that that's this is an example

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,519
of that

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,280
i just worked on

111
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
or still continue to work on

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
a

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,759
research draft in the internet research

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
task force on

115
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
feminism and internet protocols that

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
has been an ongoing effort

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
or labor of love for some years and

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,479
always looking for

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,919
collaborators or folks that have

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
insights into how we can sort of take

121
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
the

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
standard space and also then look at the

123
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,400
societal standards

124
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
things that take a principled approach

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,199
to how to design technology and um and

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,960
learn something from them

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,160
uh thanks thanks mara so yeah i think

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
just in general

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
having always been

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
a feminist activist and also working in

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,520
the technology space it very much

132
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,160
informs my political approach i would

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
say is international intersectional

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
feminism

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
and so that is

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,120
why i think it's important to approach

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,440
also privacy issues

138
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
from a feminist perspective because i

139
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,560
think there are some particularities

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,840
that fall out of that that i think we'll

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
get into a bit later

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
thanks

143
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
yeah hello

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,759
i'm trying to

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,639
also uh share my camera

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,840
yeah

147
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
it works

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
hello and thanks a lot for inviting me

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,759
to this panel um my name is ang mertens

150
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,479
and i'm representing amazberg anna's

151
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,160
back is an artist name that stands for

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
collective

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
of humans algorithms and trees it's a

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
bit of an unusual

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
collective

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,039
but

157
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,039
it came together in 2019

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,600
as an artist's research and for the

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
moment we're researching uh how we can

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
install an algo literary publishing

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
house in which the algorithms produce

162
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
automatically generated books

163
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
and the trees are

164
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
the topics of the books

165
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
but the idea is that the trees also have

166
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,479
a decision power in algorithm in the

167
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,199
algo literary publishing house so that's

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
a big part of

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
the research and it brings us uh close

170
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
to um feminist theories the colonial

171
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,680
theories

172
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
um yeah the inclusion of more than

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
humans uh in our uh making and thinking

174
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
processes

175
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,039
um so

176
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,160
i think i'm here or we're here because a

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,800
few months ago

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,840
i sent an email

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
to ask

180
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
if we could

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,520
somehow

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,759
find a collaboration

183
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,919
with the different feminist servers

184
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,120
and

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,440
yeah so i'll tell you more about this

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
later

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
thanks

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,159
nate can you introduce yourself

189
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
yes

190
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,759
so i am a researcher

191
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,440
and i started to become part of and

192
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,400
collaborate with the feminist servers uh

193
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,479
anarchy server and also

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
sister server and level burns

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
and my interest in

196
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
techno family's infrastructures

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
initially stems from reading techno

198
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
feminist theory especially the work of

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,560
donna haraway

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
so i'm not strictly an artist or

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
activist but i'm an activist academic

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
and if i use language that you find

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
unnecessarily complicated please point

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
it out in the chat and

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
don't let me get away with it

206
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
so techno feminism is this bundle of

207
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
radical traditions questioning

208
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,120
technologies from a gendered point of

209
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,160
view

210
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
and questioning gender as it is produced

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
by technologies

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,520
and it rejects technologies that do not

213
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
work for us or work against us

214
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
not only because of gender but because

215
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,199
of intersectional power relationships

216
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,599
and it also articulates the need for a

217
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,200
different

218
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
internet a feminist internet

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
and one of the most radical approaches

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
here are

221
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,599
feminist

222
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,559
servers and spider alex who is a member

223
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
of anarcho server once explained it very

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,000
well

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
and i quote the internet is not a

226
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,160
material cyberspace it's a network of

227
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
cables servers and data centers

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
and i paraphrase to keep it short

229
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
its architecture mostly follows a server

230
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
client model where servers host all

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
kinds of different services

232
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
like websites and email

233
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
and video platforms and most people with

234
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
personal computers are using those

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
services as clients

236
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,440
but most of the servers and a lot of the

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
software are owned by

238
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,920
a handful of corporations and they are

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,160
part of the extractivist and

240
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
exploitative regime of technocapitalism

241
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
that feeds on our lives and on our data

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
and yet there is

243
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
an alternative to that there are some

244
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,320
autonomous servers that run by their own

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
standards and values

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,320
and feminist servers are part of uh that

247
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
i see them as an actualization of the

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
techno famous critique of what the

249
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
internet has become

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,000
[Music]

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
and they are

252
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,279
collectively run machines they are

253
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,040
self-organized

254
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
they independently host their own tools

255
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and yeah

256
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,360
do all kinds of stuff maintain archives

257
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
and

258
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,760
are just in general a safer space online

259
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,320
for all kinds of activism

260
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
and for the arts

261
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
it's a lot of work

262
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,880
and it's very precarious but it's done

263
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
by the principle of care

264
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,040
so for me knowing that those

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
infrastructures exist and that i can be

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
part of it uh is really incredible and

267
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,600
i'm

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
glad that we gathered uh here to talk

269
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,399
about this

270
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
thank you

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,480
and madison now i'm sorry andrea andreas

272
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
yeah we are running a little bit behind

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
time so i think we have to really speed

274
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,560
up the introductions if possible

275
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959

communication i studied science of

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
communication

290
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
and but in the last 10 years

291
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
i moved in the in developing

292
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,440
and i work as a front-end developer

293
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
for a political uh

294
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,920
aim

295
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
i

296
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
meet a

297
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
feminist group in

298
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,639
the street

299
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,920
and in my activity

300
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,880
i

301
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
i build a digital space

302
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
and i

303
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
i experiment in a

304
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,639
feminist server

305
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,720
in sister server

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
um one

307
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
one

308
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
topic that

309
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,639
i spent the last five years on

310
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,680
is a learner how to build a

311
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
physical network

312
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,839
mesh network almost with wi-fi antenna

313
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
in countryside so

314
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,320
i addressed the topics of a digital

315
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,839
divide

316
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,760
and and the rights of

317
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,120
communication media from the users and

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
also with a

319
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,399
feminist

320
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
perspective of this

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,360
i i approach to the techniques

322
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
for farmers so most for

323
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,040
analogic techniques most than digital

324
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,519
thanks

325
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,240
hi all

326
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
uh i'm turning on the camera also

327
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,150
i'm

328
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,279
[Music]

329
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,240
madish from madix

330
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,079
and

331
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
i put here the link of the project so we

332
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,440
have built medics

333
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
because i mean as nate said

334
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,959
we are every day

335
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
uh using

336
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
technical infrastructure not only in our

337
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,839
personal computer but online

338
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
so i was

339
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
tired of having to ask men how to

340
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
do something because the answer was

341
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
never

342
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
kind so we decided to make it

343
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
for us through

344
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
nadex is a project that aims to simplify

345
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
the administration of online services

346
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
and keep

347
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
total control over

348
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,000
our data so you have all the the

349
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
services you need the online services on

350
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
your own space where nobody can access

351
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,959
but you

352
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
and

353
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,279
so we

354
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,519
you can with maddix install a lot of

355
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,199
application just at the click of a

356
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
button but the thing is not only that is

357
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,240
that

358
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,279
as somehow you still manage your own

359
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,959
server you

360
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
go learning how it all works and i think

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,279
the difference

362
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,120
um how it makes us a feminist provider

363
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
is that

364
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,399
we love to answer to all the doubts that

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
people have

366
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,839
and

367
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
so we can learn and understand

368
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
how all this stuff work is not just the

369
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,480
mystery it's not something magic it's

370
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
something it's just numbers you know and

371
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,720
communication so we can step by step by

372
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
step understanding how it works and so

373
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
be more

374
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
autonomous and

375
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,839
it's not like only using uh

376
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,279
um

377
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,800
fear uh uh

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
um privacy provider is really keeping

379
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,440
control over your data and your

380
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
applications so we are really

381
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
proud and happy to have done this

382
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
[Laughter]

383
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
okay thank you already for the

384
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
introduction we just want to mention

385
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,120
also we use this

386
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
moment also uh in our feminist pedagog

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,279
pedagogy

388
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,279
uh as a as a test for uh using uh the

389
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,519
restream function of our uh peer tube

390
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,279
so uh you can go to

391
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,120
tube.sisterserver.net

392
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
if uh

393
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,440
to test also whether uh this panel can

394
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
be restreamed and i give the word to

395
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,040
mara who will introduce the first uh

396
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,680
questions for this panel

397
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,079
yes so thank you all of you very much

398
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,040
for your introductory rewards so we have

399
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
actually four

400
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
main questions that they will all

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
help to

402
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,639
think and reflect on our main theme of

403
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
this panel which is how does a family

404
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,160
server

405
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,880
nurture the shared realities of

406
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,839
creatives and activists

407
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
and our first question is

408
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,959
a feminist internet is a marginalized

409
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
framework within the digital rights

410
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
movement

411
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,279
how can a techno feminist critique feed

412
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,920
the digital rights movement

413
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,240
and the question is for mallory and the

414
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
next foreign aid

415
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
yeah so i think of this question quite a

416
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
bit as i mentioned before i'm sort of

417
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
working on a draft

418
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,160
in a technical community that looks at

419
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,040
feminism and protocols but that work is

420
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
actually being done in a group that i

421
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,959
chair that was chartered to look at

422
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,320
human rights

423
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,199
so

424
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,160
we

425
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,639
realized that feminism is not the same

426
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,720
framework as human rights framework but

427
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,640
except that there are some critical

428
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
overlaps i think on the one hand

429
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,359
and this is something that nate

430
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,839
mentioned much earlier is

431
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,599
there

432
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,720
are there's a there's a feminism sort of

433
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,959
understands the special

434
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,400
um cases of additional oppression so

435
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,359
that's across not just gender but um

436
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
sexuality race

437
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,240
class

438
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,919
all these different intersections that

439
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
can compound our ability to have our

440
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,120
rights realized um and i think also

441
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
feminism because it isn't concerned with

442
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,360
um

443
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,960
i think human rights is concerned with

444
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,760
you know

445
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
setting up a baseline under which we

446
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
should not go although we realize that

447
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,360
that's often never

448
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
achieved um i think feminism isn't

449
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
concerned with that it sort of states

450
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
the world um or or comes up with

451
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,240
principles or ways of seeing the world

452
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,559
as it should be

453
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,320
and doesn't necessarily

454
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
lean into i think a common hierarchy

455
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,000
that they can be present so i think

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
where human rights for example can be

457
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,919
compatible with

458
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
an economic system like capitalism

459
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,000
i think feminism very often could not um

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,039
because of the ways in which it um

461
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,440
deals with equality so

462
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
while i'm i realize i'm only speaking

463
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,480
about differences um i do think that

464
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
that is part of sort of the research and

465
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,400
the analysis that feminists do is to

466
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
find those overlaps and to be able to

467
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
speak to a variety of different

468
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
communities those that are focused on

469
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
racial justice for example which is

470
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,640
slightly different our social justice

471
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,520
those focused on human rights those

472
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,360
focused on democracy

473
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
um and um and other kinds of expressions

474
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
so that that is the challenge i think

475
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
that's something that we always need to

476
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
be striving for when we identify issues

477
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
so when it comes to privacy since that

478
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,039
is

479
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
the real issue we have at hand here

480
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,240
i would say that you know there are

481
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
particular expressions of privacy

482
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,679
um

483
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,760
the exercising of privacy that are that

484
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
are different for folks who are um

485
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
targeted marginalized because of their

486
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,480
gender because of their race because of

487
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
a variety of intersections and we have

488
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
to um

489
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,520
consider those as we're obviously

490
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
building technology i'll just give one

491
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,200
very quick example and then i want to

492
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
hand it over to someone else who can

493
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
speak but this idea that you know we

494
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,000
have ultimate control of very expensive

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
devices each individual one of us and

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,039
that this device is essentially an

497
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,160
extension of ourselves that is true i

498
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
think for folks who don't have

499
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,080
access to

500
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
expensive devices for those who live in

501
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
a more communal setting

502
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
for those who live amongst other people

503
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
with other devices i mean those things

504
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,120
have massive considerations if your

505
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
threat model might be

506
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
coming from the person that you share

507
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
home with or the person that has access

508
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,240
to your device 24 hours a day i mean we

509
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,480
have to consider that that is different

510
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
for for all of us and so feminism might

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
give us more of an insight into how to

512
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,960
design um private technology better than

513
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,159
just looking at human rights um it's

514
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,600
just a little bit i think human rights

515
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,039
can be just a little bit too general

516
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
whereas um feminism looks at the points

517
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
of oppression um and then could help to

518
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
inform a way to offset

519
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,919
um those prop those those issues so

520
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,080
anyway that's my contribution um i'm

521
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
looking forward to hearing what nate has

522
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,158
to say

523
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,120
um

524
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,840
yeah i'm just going to join in i was

525
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
going to say a lot of similar things

526
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,000
because i also think that

527
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,360
um

528
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
human and digital rights and struggle

529
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
for feminist internet

530
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
are both

531
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,919
valuable for mobilizing against online

532
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,000
exploitation and discrimination but

533
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
they're distinct and you already said it

534
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
feminist struggles are based on the

535
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
knowledges and the embodied experience

536
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
of women of lesbian into trans and

537
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
non-binary people

538
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,520
living with technologies

539
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
so there are specific struggles the

540
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,600
struggle of finding information and

541
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,120
adequate medical treatment the

542
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,000
need to narrate the story of

543
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,039
invisibleized women and queers in

544
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,440
computer and internet history

545
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,559
fighting cyber bullying and hate speech

546
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,760
and

547
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,240
so the techno family struggle is a

548
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,120
struggle from within itself organized

549
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,039
it's not primarily directed at the

550
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,679
institutions or corporations

551
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,320
and it's not primarily a corrective to

552
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
their bad politics from above

553
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,679
because it's just like you said it's

554
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,120
about

555
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
mallory it's a radically imagining

556
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
alternative futures from below and doing

557
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,200
that together and with care

558
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,240
so

559
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
yeah i think problematizing the human

560
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
rights framework

561
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,400
is this challenge of looking out for the

562
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
margins and to always

563
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
acknowledge difference before assuming

564
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
equality

565
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
and

566
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
like historically the feminist critique

567
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,039
of privacy

568
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,320
is a good example to demonstrate that

569
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
privacy aims to

570
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,559
protect all citizens equally

571
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,360
but

572
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
uh if we look at it the separation of

573
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
private and public turned out to work

574
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
really badly for

575
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
women who were deliberately confined to

576
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
the domestic sphere where male

577
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
domination

578
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
was naturalized and i'm talking about

579
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,559
the

580
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,480
mostly white and middle to upper class

581
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,520
women who organized in the second wave

582
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
feminism

583
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
so yeah the right to privacy translated

584
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
into very different realities according

585
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,039
to your ascribed gender and economic

586
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,200
situation

587
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,159
and of course with the advance of data

588
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
extraction fuel technocapitalism

589
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,080
a lot changed and this binary separation

590
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
of public private is a little bit

591
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
outdated

592
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,559
but

593
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,880
privacy concerns are

594
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
more pressing than ever

595
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
and

596
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,799
so yeah i think from the techno family's

597
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,400
approach we can learn

598
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
to question those individualistic

599
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,760
uh ways of thinking privacy as privacy

600
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
self management or

601
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
the famous privacy paradox where people

602
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
seemingly act against their own

603
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
interests

604
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,750
and

605
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,840
[Music]

606
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,919
yeah the reason why is uh

607
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,360
or

608
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
how to rethink privacy in a techno

609
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,919
feminist way then would be to

610
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
make it a technocollective approach

611
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,760
considering

612
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
uh

613
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,919
also more than human aspects also

614
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
issues like the environment

615
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
do it with care

616
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
and fight asymmetric

617
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,279
power relations

618
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,279
and actually see this already happening

619
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,600
in the discourse around privacy

620
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,919
starts shifting towards information

621
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
self-determination

622
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,400
or even data sovereignty

623
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
and

624
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
this focus on the conditions of being

625
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,159
able to consent to the sharing of

626
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
information

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
and i think that might be the effect of

628
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,840
a technofeminist critique and so yeah i

629
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,120
think there's still a lot to learn

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
and to insist in technologies that take

631
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,679
our diverse needs and embodied

632
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,880
experiences into account

633
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
thank you nate and we can move

634
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,279
to our next question

635
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,440
so uh

636
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
the next question is what are the tools

637
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,760
for organizing our workflow well i mean

638
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,200
our i mean in terms of having a feminist

639
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,919
servers feminist infrastructure so how

640
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
what are the tools for organizing our

641
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,159
work on these infrastructures

642
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
and in general around techno feminist

643
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,520
infrastructures what are the terms of

644
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,480
participation

645
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,240
exclusivity and i would like to hear

646
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,279
from

647
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
madison

648
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
and then andrea and then nate

649
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
thank you

650
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,880
hi

651
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,039
and

652
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,480
so

653
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
basically

654
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
what

655
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,600
we have used a lot during all our

656
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
process

657
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,720
uh

658
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,240
in terms of tool

659
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
for organization for organizing this

660
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
workflow has been

661
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
uh

662
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,840
using keeping into account all the needs

663
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
that each different feminist

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
organization have i mean we need to go

665
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,120
on thinking about

666
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,039
what everybody is facing what they need

667
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,919
uh so that we can build a useful tools

668
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,480
we can be a useful

669
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,159
framework

670
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,039
so

671
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,840
for example from our experience in

672
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,360
maddix we

673
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
from when we started till until where we

674
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,440
are now

675
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,320
we had to change our

676
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,840
our milestones our

677
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,799
um path

678
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,240
because of

679
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
uh people that were using medics i mean

680
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
the community uh told us that they had

681
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
different needs that we were not keeping

682
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
into account

683
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,480
i mean

684
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,880
uh basically uh what we need is knowing

685
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,000
who we are and who we are talking to and

686
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,880
who we are working with

687
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,930
um

688
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,279
[Music]

689
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,400
for example right now i make a practical

690
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
example because maybe it's clearer

691
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,520
more clear

692
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,679
in we are working a lot with south

693
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,039
american organization that are in

694
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,640
most of them are in critical uh politics

695
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
situation their their country

696
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,880
and so most of them are very afraid with

697
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,120
their right to be um

698
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
about attacks they could

699
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
receive because from

700
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
sexist groups or

701
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
right wings groups etc

702
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,080
so they really need some tools security

703
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,200
tools to protect their website their

704
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,440
against their details attacks and things

705
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,480
like that

706
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
so maybe in europe

707
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,600
uh feminist groups are not so exposed to

708
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,720
this kind of of threat

709
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
and

710
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,559
so i mean for us is very important

711
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,120
because to have this feedback because we

712
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,679
didn't take took this too much into

713
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,799
account

714
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,000
you know what i mean

715
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,880
so

716
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
if we want to if we want to

717
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,960
to build infrastructure that are useful

718
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,559
for different feminist frameworks

719
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,960
i mean this feedback was very useful for

720
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,840
us

721
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
and

722
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,360
uh

723
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
the

724
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,320
terms of partition participation i mean

725
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
this goes within the other no i i think

726
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,799
this answer both uh because

727
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,640
i mean we can't build

728
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,880
a tool that is just in our mind and it

729
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,080
just feeds into our needs we that the

730
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,520
good thing is that we have a lot of

731
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,760
mailing lists a lot of spaces where we

732
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,799
can share

733
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,679
and

734
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,480
i i'm old style in this sense that the

735
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
old main list is always the most useful

736
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,399
to to to know what's going on among us i

737
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,799
don't know if i answered the question

738
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,760
but

739
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
that's that's it

740
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,799
yeah yeah thanks but i think i just an

741
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,200
extra

742
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,880
sub question would be

743
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
do you have any

744
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,080
type of

745
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
decision making in your

746
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,399
foundation

747
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,679
or in the organization yes

748
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,399
yes because when we start a new i mean

749
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,480
normally the decision we have to take

750
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,880
are quite technical i mean do we add

751
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,520
this application or this other one

752
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,640
and

753
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,960
when we decided we decide this all

754
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,279
together of course but

755
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
most the most of the time starting from

756
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,159
what the community asked so that's

757
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,440
that's why i started with the previous

758
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,240
uh

759
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,600
theme i mean

760
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,440
they are not decisions just among us

761
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,000
but of course then we

762
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,960
evaluate if it makes sense if if it's

763
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,320
technically possible if

764
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,240
compared with how much it did cost in

765
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
terms of money and also human resources

766
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
but

767
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,960
most of the time we add things because

768
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,520
the community

769
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
said they need you know so and then

770
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
internally

771
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,159
we decide all together we are not only

772
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,120
women

773
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
there are also men

774
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,039
and we i mean we

775
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
even if i mean it's good because the

776
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,480
decision is not only technical is is

777
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
like a mix so

778
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
uh

779
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
and how many

780
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,600
there are the active people in your

781
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,320
organization we are two persons that

782
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,240
work all the time

783
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,880
on on the project but then we do

784
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,960
collaboration depending on what we have

785
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
to do so we

786
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
collaborate with people that

787
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,720
i mean they also do other things they

788
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
are not only doing that

789
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
yeah okay thank you i think we have to

790
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
go to the next

791
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,039
speaker

792
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,000
so andrea please could you also

793
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,760
elaborate on the same question

794
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
what are the tools for organizing our

795
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,039
workflow and decision making

796
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,600
in feminist servers

797
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,080
yeah

798
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,519
i

799
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,880
i speak about the feminist

800
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,760
infrastructure not only server i

801
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,960
i followed the idea to

802
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,679
build a feminist group

803
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,640
build

804
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,919
feminist services and build a feminist

805
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,519
network

806
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,559
in

807
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,679
physical network okay cables and

808
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,519
antennas and these

809
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,240
so

810
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,480
i have three different uh

811
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,159
representation of the problems

812
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,440
like

813
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
and i try to

814
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
have always uh

815
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,679
a bridge between these three

816
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,000
this free organization

817
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
with a feminist group that

818
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
reclaims rights in the street

819
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,840
we try to use the consensus method we do

820
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,000
meeting and we try to respect

821
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,679
the

822
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,720
the

823
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
idea of the other and speak

824
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,159
enough

825
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
enough but speak to arrive

826
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
to take the children without the dub so

827
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
consult all the point of view to arrive

828
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,960
to decide something so uh

829
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,159
is a slow when you don't know a lot the

830
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,159
other people but became

831
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,519
faster when you know with the other and

832
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,440
when the relationship

833
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,240
is

834
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
a long uh

835
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,640
is long in the time and is the same to

836
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
decide for the servers

837
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,559
in the admin side and is the same to

838
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,519
decide in the network in the network we

839
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,240
have

840
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
we have not an admin side we have

841
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,240
users so that the contribute to build

842
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
their network

843
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,440
and so

844
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
this side with a consensus method is

845
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,480
something that the needs that you self

846
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,640
doubt to you so all the people that

847
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
participate and needs to study and

848
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,200
a lot of time together we need to take

849
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
lessons

850
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,320
because we live in uh in not in the best

851
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,840
world possible we don't live in a

852
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,720
society where census method is used

853
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,640
and

854
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
sometimes we need to help

855
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,240
to keep our mind

856
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
in

857
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,600
a consensus method

858
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,559
another part that is really strong

859
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,559
is a assertive communication and also

860
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,080
not to use aggressive passive aggressive

861
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,519
communication

862
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,640
that

863
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,880
it's something that we put a lot of

864
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,879
attention because uh

865
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,079
we find things a marginalized

866
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,918
group like us like us that we are

867
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,760
far some of us are farmer are not urban

868
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,639
not in the city and feminists

869
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,918
so

870
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,679
a good collection of strange people

871
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,440
and

872
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,679
and

873
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,800
so

874
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,960
so it's a we train ourselves to

875
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,239
to

876
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,560
push our rights

877
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
um

878
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,639
and um

879
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,839
so

880
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
i think that one of the most the biggest

881
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,440
action is a build for us a safe safe

882
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,560
space

883
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
uh just in the in the street in the

884
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,599
squares in the place that we

885
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,480
we stay physically and

886
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,640
in

887
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
in our network

888
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
and in

889
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,320
in the

890
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
server services

891
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,520
probably the most interesting

892
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,440
part

893
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,280
of no i don't know either is not an

894
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,079
almost interesting part the three

895
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,839
uh the three parts

896
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,119
of the real

897
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,320
of the

898
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
services in the internet

899
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,119
and the other part of be in another

900
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
internet

901
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,119
we

902
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,320
because

903
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
we build other net

904
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
are

905
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,760
changing and

906
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
and brings results

907
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
so yeah thank you for elaborating on it

908
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,920
and so i i think we have a shared common

909
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,200
interest in our feminist infrastructures

910
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,320
but uh of course the big question is how

911
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,520
can we sustain these feminist servers in

912
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,160
in terms of resources whether it's

913
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,280
models of uh funding or solidarity

914
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
actions or

915
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,760
the membership

916
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,599
or client-based

917
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,760
relation so how how can we sustain

918
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,280
them in terms of of resources

919
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,119
um do you want to

920
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,880
say something about that

921
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,599
yes sure

922
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,800
yeah

923
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,760
but i

924
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,640
i think it's important because i feel i

925
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,359
i talk from another uh point of view i

926
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,040
think it's important to introduce a

927
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,599
little uh the work we do so that you

928
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,079
have an idea of of uh what the

929
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,400
maybe more metaphorical needs could be

930
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,440
um

931
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,040
before uh

932
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,720
i can answer the question is that okay

933
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,800
uh yes yeah okay nice so um

934
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,119
yeah i just want to uh

935
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,720
show you one of the

936
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,440
uh

937
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,040
the experiments we did uh the idea is

938
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,839
that um

939
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
we always take into consideration this

940
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,760
space

941
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
where

942
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,560
human vegetal and artificial

943
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,359
intelligences meet and by opening the

944
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,839
space and respecting the space

945
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,200
with all the

946
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
different entities involved

947
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,520
we encounter a lot of issues

948
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,480
but

949
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,720
yeah our first show maybe an example of

950
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
a work we did

951
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,520
when we were in residency in madrid

952
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,640
last year

953
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,598
um can i take the presenter's role here

954
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,240
oh i don't see a way to maybe i just uh

955
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,319
paste the website and then you can um

956
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
you can do it for me

957
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,000
or

958
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
is there a way to take the presenter's

959
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,920
role

960
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,839
no don't think so

961
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,040
ah yeah

962
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,040
okay

963
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,959
and okay

964
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,920
maybe it's better just to paste the the

965
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,359
link

966
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,599
that people can see it from their

967
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,640
computer

968
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,040
yeah i think it's best to paste the link

969
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
a nice because we are running behind

970
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,119
time already yeah yeah yeah no worries

971
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,599
yeah so

972
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,800
if you go to this page then you see uh

973
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,119
the research we're doing it's a one-year

974
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
research and

975
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,880
i would like to show you uh the book a

976
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,920
walk along the trees of madrid

977
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,400
you can click on it

978
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,079
in the

979
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,240
right section

980
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,880
and there you see that you can

981
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,920
actually

982
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,880
choose

983
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,359
what kind of data you're using to

984
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,520
generate a book and then you can

985
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,880
generate the book on the spot

986
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,800
the

987
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,480
it's a markov chain

988
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,560
writing the book so

989
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,880
you get the the narrative perspective of

990
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,720
the markov chain

991
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,760
where

992
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,079
the book shows the poetic process of the

993
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,599
algorithm using

994
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,960
data from these novels and

995
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,079
organizing then a walk along trees in

996
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,800
the

997
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,960
in a in this particular neighborhoods in

998
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,720
madrid

999
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
the idea is

1000
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,240
that

1001
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,960
we

1002
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,000
create a publishing house

1003
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,839
using these kind of experiments

1004
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,280
for now

1005
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
the website runs on a commercial server

1006
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,839
but you can imagine

1007
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,839
as we're looking

1008
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,440
at an in

1009
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,599
inclusive space we have very different

1010
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
needs

1011
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
we would like to

1012
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,640
understand and get to know all the

1013
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
different algorithms we would like to

1014
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,920
also work with consent of trees whatever

1015
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,520
that means and what kind of

1016
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,839
methodologies we need to invent for that

1017
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,880
um

1018
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,599
but that also means that it's important

1019
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,359
to be able to look at the carbon

1020
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,119
emission of a server

1021
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
to be able to do experiments with more

1022
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,440
alternative and ecological

1023
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,079
energies and um

1024
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,920
yeah

1025
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,760
in terms of what it needs um

1026
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,200
it's uh

1027
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,680
the amazeback comes out of a tradition

1028
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,560
of constant in domain public

1029
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
constant is a

1030
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
organization in brussels for for media

1031
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
and arts also with the feminist

1032
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,839
methodology

1033
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,280
approach

1034
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,680
and so for years we have been looking at

1035
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,560
how can we use um

1036
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
how can the infrastructure reflect uh

1037
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,839
also the

1038
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
the philosophy of the organization and

1039
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,319
so for am i inspect this is the same how

1040
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
can the infrastructure reflect

1041
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
a non-extractive

1042
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,160
safe

1043
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
space for inclusion for

1044
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,280
humans and more than humans

1045
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,839
so these are quite large questions and

1046
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,680
we're

1047
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
through small experiments we're trying

1048
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
to find answers to this so it's a much

1049
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,320
more playful approach

1050
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
[Music]

1051
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,960
i think than

1052
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,599
what the colleagues uh before explained

1053
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,119
and it's super

1054
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,760
impressive and uh yeah i admire a lot of

1055
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,720
your work

1056
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,000
um

1057
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,599
yeah it's it's trying to get together

1058
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,839
um

1059
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,119
spaces and to make them somehow work for

1060
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,960
the moment we are

1061
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,880
we decided to install a server

1062
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
on our site

1063
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,839
which will be a feminist server but for

1064
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,119
let's say

1065
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,839
our project so it will not be this kind

1066
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,160
of collective server where other people

1067
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,040
can host but i think in the long term uh

1068
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
what would be really interesting is to

1069
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,920
see how that can become part of a

1070
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
feminist server network

1071
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
um and what that means

1072
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,280
more than humans in this network

1073
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,480
so

1074
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,680
i don't know

1075
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,200
we are working with public funding and

1076
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,720
research mainly research funding um so

1077
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
this allows for

1078
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,920
this kind of more experimental

1079
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,079
approach and

1080
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,680
yeah

1081
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,760
i don't know if that's really well i

1082
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,400
think uh i mean i think you you resolved

1083
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,800
a little bit from your own needs

1084
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,280
the to have a feminist server and

1085
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
actually also

1086
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,240
our uh self uh dedicated to uh find the

1087
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,280
resources to sustain it and to also

1088
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
expand and make uh links within the

1089
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,040
wider feminist network maybe it's also

1090
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,560
like this is from an artist's

1091
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,040
perspective and and

1092
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,839
wider societal uh

1093
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,240
um and i think maddish is

1094
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,760
with maddix there is more the server who

1095
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,760
offers services can you also maybe uh um

1096
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,960
try to uh work on this idea of of the

1097
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
resources to sustain

1098
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,040
feminist servers

1099
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,640
hi yes of course

1100
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,079
uh we

1101
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,760
uh were

1102
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,920
like we didn't want to

1103
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,800
uh

1104
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,800
be to breakerize i mean all the work we

1105
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,960
do we wanted to be remunerated so we are

1106
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,760
a little bit against the voluntary

1107
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,720
uh framework because otherwise then we

1108
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,400
have to go and work for google for

1109
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,960
example to to eat

1110
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,000
so we decided to make medics

1111
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,800
uh

1112
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,440
like a company that could earn money

1113
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,480
itself with its activity

1114
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,920
and

1115
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,079
so we give

1116
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,760
services we give hosting also we do not

1117
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,839
only develop a software and this is how

1118
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,640
we

1119
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,200
get some income we also

1120
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,800
have some funding because we build

1121
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,319
projects which are basically building

1122
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,720
software or or

1123
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
or configurations

1124
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,640
that are open source and free so we can

1125
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,200
put it at disposal of the community and

1126
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,359
for that we receive

1127
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,240
like help some funding so this is the

1128
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,520
combination we didn't want under it to

1129
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,400
to be sustained on funding because it

1130
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,599
can fail

1131
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,640
we

1132
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,560
our aim is to

1133
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
build uh

1134
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,880
in our internal community people working

1135
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,079
with medics to be paid for their work

1136
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,119
and to be autonomous in this sense so we

1137
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,280
are not same person yet

1138
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,119
uh in this

1139
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,440
situation but

1140
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,480
maddix is having incomes and

1141
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,079
so i think this hybrid model is working

1142
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,760
for us and

1143
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,200
gives it gives us quite a lot of

1144
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,040
stability we started it in

1145
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,280
19 2016

1146
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,599
and we are still alive and we are going

1147
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,480
better

1148
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,560
step by step so

1149
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,480
i can't we

1150
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,560
we don't have donation because as we

1151
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,800
have our company

1152
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,599
it sounds strange to us but it would be

1153
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,319
also if we work on free software i mean

1154
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,319
the secret for me is working and

1155
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,079
publishing all the code so hopefully the

1156
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,160
community can use it and so you could

1157
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,119
also

1158
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:08,000
um

1159
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,880
activate a donation model

1160
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,480
for for having

1161
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,400
money to to work on your project

1162
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,880
and mallory you have any uh ideas about

1163
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,160
uh the sustaining uh of

1164
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,440
the family servers in terms of resources

1165
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,599
it's a really hard problem i think it's

1166
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,319
good to hear um maddox is

1167
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,520
trying to fix it um i think that it is

1168
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,680
difficult

1169
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,200
to sustain so

1170
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,040
i i would just add that i think that

1171
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,160
there is a spectrum of of um

1172
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,640
funding models i'm particularly

1173
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
interested in just finding

1174
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
uh projects that are exciting that we

1175
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,000
can learn from that maybe are temporary

1176
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,319
they only last a few years but that they

1177
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,800
um help to strengthen the movement the

1178
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,119
feminist and technology movement more

1179
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,720
broadly because it gives us something to

1180
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,400
work on together um that can be funded

1181
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,480
but that maybe ultimately ends and again

1182
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,839
like the learning goes back to the

1183
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,839
community but um i do think the problem

1184
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,839
is sustainability is really difficult so

1185
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,280
for example one is you know learning how

1186
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,079
are asking a question uh you know

1187
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,440
would would feminists run vpns be

1188
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,880
more secure

1189
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,800
or what are the qualities of those sorts

1190
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,200
of vpns if you gave you know feminist

1191
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,280
collectives the tools that they needed

1192
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
to build them and then run them and use

1193
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,359
them for a while

1194
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,599
what are the particularities of that is

1195
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,200
it different from other activist

1196
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,800
services is it different from corporate

1197
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,040
services that sort of thing um and then

1198
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,280
hopefully that learning actually informs

1199
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,160
um real developers it informs funders

1200
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,319
and informs the space gives us some more

1201
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,280
data and credibility when we say you

1202
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,119
know the way that it's done

1203
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,599
for everyone isn't good enough

1204
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,960
you know those those are the kinds of

1205
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,319
projects that i'm interested in looking

1206
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,079
at but um it doesn't satisfy

1207
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,599
you know it doesn't help you eat as as

1208
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,319
mattis was saying like i i have to admit

1209
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,480
that but um

1210
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,160
but i think that we should be creative

1211
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,800
about trying to discover and research

1212
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,880
certain things maybe within the context

1213
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,960
of more sustainable models

1214
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,040
but that also we need spaces to simply

1215
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,839
just play for a short period of time

1216
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,240
make something you know really concrete

1217
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,440
happen

1218
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,599
and then try to make sure that that

1219
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,440
that isn't forgotten that that moment in

1220
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,599
time isn't forgotten

1221
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,839
yeah i think that leads us to our last

1222
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,480
question uh we are normally it's the

1223
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,240
moment that we would open it up and

1224
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,079
maybe we can

1225
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,319
ask the question and then open it up um

1226
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,040
or

1227
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,960
run a bit over time um but

1228
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,960
what would be an imaginary policy or

1229
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,839
event or that could empower our our

1230
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:02,880
mission

1231
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,720
and um

1232
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
our fine collaborations with uh

1233
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,280
like-minded political allies aligned uh

1234
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,880
uh projects

1235
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,520
uh can can

1236
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,880
tried to say something about it

1237
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,880
so

1238
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,480
yeah one of the

1239
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,000
ideas

1240
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,280
that

1241
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,520
a colleague of the collective uh came up

1242
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,520
with uh guillaume um

1243
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,960
is a a kind of book lounge performance

1244
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,720
for the publishing house where

1245
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,200
we would

1246
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,880
have a server on a raspberry pi

1247
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,839
um

1248
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
and

1249
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,760
this server would run either on solar

1250
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,640
power or on

1251
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,160
the idea was actually more uh to have it

1252
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,440
run on

1253
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
the wood the wood burning of an old tree

1254
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,760
and

1255
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,800
to have the book lounge

1256
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,000
last as long as uh

1257
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,960
the energy is there so when the energy

1258
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,720
is gone then the book launch is over and

1259
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,119
the server is dead so that's it's a it's

1260
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,160
a very playful uh example but i think it

1261
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
might be an interesting experience it's

1262
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,920
like imagination from an artist

1263
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,319
perspective maybe also andrea who's on

1264
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,359
the streets and within the community and

1265
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,839
politicizing our activity can also

1266
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,119
imagine

1267
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,119
something

1268
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
i

1269
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,920
i

1270
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,440
like

1271
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
i think that we have to do

1272
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,280
a bigger work

1273
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,880
on

1274
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,000
on our

1275
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,160
on

1276
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,240
learning skills

1277
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,479
and

1278
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,359
consciousness about the

1279
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,839
feminist and the

1280
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,720
and so

1281
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,200
like we need a lot of like internet in

1282
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,920
this moment is more a big

1283
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,000
patriarchy propaganda

1284
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,200
and we need a lot of other places

1285
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,480
uh that

1286
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,440
were

1287
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
where uh spread the different culture

1288
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,119
so

1289
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,160
uh

1290
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,559
i really i believe that the meeting

1291
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,000
person is the best but yeah i i need i

1292
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,440
know also that because build more trust

1293
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,599
and it's better but i know that it's

1294
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,400
difficult and i'm really happy of the

1295
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,640
experiment of today about restreaming in

1296
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,400
peercast

1297
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
i would like to spend one two words

1298
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,359
about the fact that

1299
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,880
is a peer-to-peer and is a technology

1300
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,839
that

1301
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,079
is developed to

1302
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,359
to

1303
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
restream

1304
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,520
big contents but with less bandwidth

1305
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,160
uh using a bit of bandwidth from the

1306
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,280
users

1307
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,240
every users use a bit a bit of bandwidth

1308
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,280
but

1309
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,559
isn't a way to

1310
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,599
is experimental way but is technically

1311
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,480
it's interesting for

1312
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,520
for a different

1313
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,280
organization not

1314
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,000
not for example server server client

1315
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,960
about peer-to-peer and

1316
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,359
i think

1317
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,520
a good experiment

1318
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
yeah it's a good experiment it's a

1319
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,480
technical implement in implementation so

1320
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,839
maybe nate from from a more academic

1321
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,880
theoretical discursive uh environment

1322
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,920
what would you

1323
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,520
imagine

1324
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,359
maybe in relation with

1325
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,880
feminist data politics or

1326
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,400
yes i think

1327
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,800
what i'm trying with writing my phd in

1328
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,880
this collaboration is already this kind

1329
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,640
of experiment on

1330
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,200
whether this could work

1331
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,920
bridging like the academic and the and

1332
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,839
the activist

1333
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,119
and um yeah so what i try to do is i

1334
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,599
hope to contribute

1335
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,680
in some ways uh

1336
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,319
also

1337
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,319
with the theory one thing that really

1338
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,920
interests me are

1339
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,880
data politics uh

1340
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,440
ways of handling data

1341
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,520
imagining data relations

1342
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,200
that are different from the

1343
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,079
dominant paradigm of extractivist data

1344
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,559
capture

1345
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,470
so

1346
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:48,640
[Music]

1347
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,319
i don't know i just take this moment to

1348
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,760
maybe also

1349
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,480
talk about the

1350
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,640
server client

1351
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,800
relationship that was asked about

1352
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,640
earlier

1353
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,960
um

1354
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,599
following the the data manifest no

1355
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,640
which says that feminist data politics

1356
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,839
are

1357
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,520
a refusal of an

1358
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,839
inheritance and part of this inheritance

1359
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:18,400
is this uh language and concepts that

1360
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,880
are used to imagine and create relations

1361
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,440
between users and hosts and devices and

1362
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,119
systems

1363
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,760
and yeah so the the server client

1364
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,000
relation is problematic because it's

1365
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,160
it's binary it's patriarchal and it's

1366
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,559
commercial and

1367
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,880
so what i observe is feminist servers

1368
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,319
and techno infrastructures and trying to

1369
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,799
work around those roles

1370
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,880
and invent new ones and there is this

1371
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,040
very beautiful manifesto and i'm not

1372
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,240
sure if it's online anymore because

1373
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,960
the free tech co-op cafe was

1374
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,520
shut down

1375
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,720
but it's um

1376
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,400
it talks about the refusal of

1377
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,559
commercialized hierarchical idea of

1378
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,400
services and it invites us to shift from

1379
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,240
the concept of

1380
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,799
services towards mutual aid and communal

1381
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,040
gathering

1382
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,200
so

1383
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,319
yeah this is kind of what i do also as a

1384
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,319
researcher collaborating and trying to

1385
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,240
look into how

1386
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,520
uh

1387
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,200
techno feminists

1388
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
collectives organize themselves

1389
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,640
differently

1390
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,280
and and create those emancipatory

1391
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,599
relationships between women trans

1392
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,119
non-binary people and also but data and

1393
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,040
machines and

1394
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,839
other collectives and

1395
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,279
yeah so this is already i think

1396
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,480
an experiment to form this kind of

1397
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,480
alliance also with the university that

1398
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,920
can has some resources that i can also

1399
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,559
uh bring on the table yeah

1400
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,480
yeah it's nice i think with our last

1401
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,400
question that you already opened

1402
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,559
to the audience and you make immediate

1403
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,319
uh uh

1404
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,720
aligned allies

1405
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
with the audience maybe it's also still

1406
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,119
nice uh before we go more official to

1407
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,000
the

1408
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,400
questions is to hear

1409
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
mallory on

1410
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,200
the

1411
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
imaginative part on the policies

1412
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,119
which could empower our

1413
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,119
families

1414
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,839
is it a is it a question that was in the

1415
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,400
chat um

1416
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,440
i know it was still one of our official

1417
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,280
questions uh how to empower

1418
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,160
yeah if you want to react on a question

1419
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,480
which was in the chat it's also good no

1420
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,400
no it's okay thanks for reorienting me

1421
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,200
no i i guess i i sort of said in my last

1422
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,040
intervention where i think that we do

1423
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,200
sort of sometimes need things to work on

1424
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,799
together some moments of activity

1425
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:03,920
and

1426
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,880
you know projects um so i'm really

1427
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,359
hoping to find something that that work

1428
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,359
that does that i think there are so many

1429
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,200
out there and we think of them i think

1430
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,440
as is maybe sometimes lasting forever

1431
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,920
but they don't um and so i wonder if we

1432
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,799
can

1433
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,839
um maybe iterate on that model sometimes

1434
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,520
by knowing that you know we're going to

1435
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,280
do something together for a short time

1436
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,040
and then we're going to get back to our

1437
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,400
day jobs or

1438
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,480
our our lives and things like that so it

1439
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,319
doesn't take so much pressure on keeping

1440
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,240
some things that are meant to be

1441
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,319
temporary more permanent

1442
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,319
but knowing that the movement itself is

1443
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,680
what's permanent

1444
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,040
and we strengthen that by having um

1445
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,599
flutters and flurries of short-term

1446
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,160
activity that that gives us inspiration

1447
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,839
and gives us um

1448
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,520
you know data and

1449
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,359
research that gives us credibility and

1450
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,280
that sort of thing so i'm um you know

1451
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,280
i'm interested in that and of course any

1452
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,599
sort of ongoing research that looks at

1453
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,799
um

1454
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,559
internet and internet protocols is

1455
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,359
definitely within um ongoing work for me

1456
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,440
as part of the internet research task

1457
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,559
force so

1458
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,160
folks doing that should

1459
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,839
reach out and figure out how we can help

1460
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,119
to give a platform to that work

1461
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,960
and make sure it's visible

1462
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,280
thanks

1463
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,989
[Music]

1464
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,920
uh

1465
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,839
well i've not seen

1466
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,880
really too loud i mean

1467
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,480
heavens are always welcome and uh but in

1468
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,000
these times of coding and so on i just

1469
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
uh insist with the

1470
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,440
open source

1471
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,559
project so we can what we do

1472
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,359
is not only for us and i really believe

1473
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,319
in

1474
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,559
in in this and so

1475
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,040
just publish and use

1476
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,839
what

1477
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,480
our colleagues are doing

1478
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,440
no

1479
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,280
maybe stand a moment to see what were

1480
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,520
the questions inside of this chat but

1481
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
because i think there is also a lot of

1482
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,319
colleagues there

1483
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,119
can you paraphrase some of the questions

1484
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,599
mara which were circulating through the

1485
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,599
chat

1486
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,440
i cannot hear you mara

1487
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,920
can you open your microphone

1488
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,119
sorry yes

1489
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,000
so

1490
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
well i the first question about their

1491
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,200
servers uh though i wouldn't call them

1492
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,559
gendered

1493
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,280
i don't know if this is something we are

1494
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,040
focused on this panel

1495
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,280
is gendered is also binary

1496
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,319
and

1497
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,559
so the question was if then if it's

1498
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,799
necessary to have gendered servers in

1499
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,240
terms of more fancy privacy

1500
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,680
and the other one was about sovereignty

1501
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,280
if the concept of sovereignty is related

1502
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,160
to our panelists

1503
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,799
i can answer those

1504
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,880
uh questions quickly

1505
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,240
so yeah i also wouldn't call them

1506
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,000
gendered

1507
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,839
servers they are family servers but

1508
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,040
they're techno feminists in that they

1509
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,440
uh make apparent issues of that come

1510
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,160
with a gendered reality even like it's

1511
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,319
often binary gendered when they're i

1512
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,960
think there's also non-binary genders

1513
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,160
um yeah and i think we also

1514
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,079
went and explained a little bit of

1515
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,559
what these servers are and what spaces

1516
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,319
they can offer and why they're necessary

1517
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:55,520
and

1518
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,559
yeah i even mentioned it i think then uh

1519
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,720
data sovereignty is

1520
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,799
uh i think

1521
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,240
uh

1522
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,000
used in many different contexts um

1523
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,960
but it's an important

1524
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,319
principle that i think is yeah

1525
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,480
helps us to grasp with the issues of

1526
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,400
privacy in a

1527
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,319
way that really

1528
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,640
looks into

1529
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,680
communities to empower them it's yeah on

1530
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,640
a communal level it's uh there is a

1531
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,599
discourse around uh indigenous data

1532
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,280
sovereignty

1533
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,160
and um so yeah is

1534
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,319
it connects

1535
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,799
and andrea would you like associate like

1536
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,799
the work you're doing with building of

1537
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,680
the community networks

1538
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,359
as a sovereign practice

1539
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,280
okay

1540
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,599
serenity is a

1541
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,430
it's a problematic words

1542
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:09,520
[Music]

1543
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,079
i work in

1544
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,400
inclusive community

1545
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,920
so

1546
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,240
uh sovereignty

1547
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,039
uh

1548
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,280
in the political

1549
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,319
term

1550
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,680
is a

1551
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,160
in philosophical term is something to

1552
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,359
express exclusion

1553
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,520
who has the the

1554
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,200
rights to

1555
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,799
exclude others

1556
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,440
so it's a problematic words because

1557
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,880
i

1558
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,000
i

1559
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,680
build a

1560
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,200
inclusive community and that take the

1561
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,520
responsibility of transformation

1562
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,400
and

1563
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,039
insight

1564
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,760
but

1565
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,039
yeah

1566
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,640
we use a inside of a community of

1567
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,839
farmers

1568
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,680
and we use the term

1569
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,640
far

1570
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,520
america because what was one of the

1571
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,240
first uh

1572
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,720
the first concept

1573
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,079
used but i think we have to move on

1574
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,480
another term

1575
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,079
in other words

1576
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,079
um

1577
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,319
okay

1578
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,640
i saw people popping in and out with the

1579
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,559
cameras uh i think it's because the

1580
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,520
bandwidth was a little bit uh clogging

1581
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,359
uh was there uh

1582
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,119
another question

1583
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,039
and then maybe we can

1584
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,160
finish

1585
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,680
this

1586
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,559
moment

1587
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,200
yeah there was one more question would

1588
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,280
feminist of things

1589
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,400
devices for example be less designed to

1590
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,480
gather all our data and track all our

1591
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,960
movements would it be more considerate

1592
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,960
to protect our privacy and this type of

1593
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,240
yeah let's say feminist devices

1594
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,319
also yes if there is any research no

1595
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,000
made by women

1596
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,920
on this topic of tracking

1597
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,200
yeah

1598
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,039
i guess from you are asking the person

1599
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,240
who asked this from a feminist

1600
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,839
perspective yeah

1601
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,599
i i think andrea wants to say something

1602
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,079
about it

1603
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,680
oh actually

1604
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,480
um

1605
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,799
or no i don't understand i'm andrea it's

1606
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,720
a bit confusing i think it's andrea

1607
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,240
andrea

1608
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,240
yes

1609
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,680
oh

1610
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,039
i think so that

1611
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,319
the

1612
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,480
a lot of work was done

1613
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,520
on digital rights but

1614
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,480
we are still like a

1615
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,640
prehistorical age

1616
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,240
because uh

1617
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,640
um

1618
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,079
rights at the moment are not a matter

1619
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,559
that the infrastructure

1620
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,160
take cares

1621
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,240
so is na is like

1622
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,160
so is every one of us

1623
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,839
has to take care of

1624
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,200
their

1625
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,720
rights

1626
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,280
in the internet and i not agree with

1627
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,440
this perspective

1628
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,359
uh is like to say um

1629
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,280
in a metaphor

1630
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,839
in this moment the privacy is giving to

1631
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,640
us

1632
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,799
in the panorama of privacy there are a

1633
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,480
lot of tools

1634
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,640
that are tools that the user can use

1635
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,520
and i'm not agree with this perspective

1636
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,440
i think that

1637
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,960
default is a privacy in the internet but

1638
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,720
in the this moment

1639
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,839
is abuse is the default in the internet

1640
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,039
and if you take care uh you have to

1641
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,280
defend and then you have to use the

1642
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,440
tools and i'm

1643
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,400
i'm

1644
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,599
disagree

1645
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,280
uh in but uh i'm we we are living the

1646
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,119
same in the streets

1647
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,640
uh if you want to defend

1648
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,000
yourself you have to work not work alone

1649
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,720
and with and staying with your friends

1650
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,400
and

1651
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,720
i think is a really

1652
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:47,680
bad

1653
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,359
position in this moment

1654
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,839
yeah i would like to just add a little

1655
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,359
thing i think the

1656
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,160
data tracking and data mining is a

1657
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,960
capitalist a techno capitalist

1658
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,839
economy model i mean the

1659
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,400
in on the in the question of how to

1660
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,880
sustain these infrastructures uh you see

1661
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,079
a lot of the

1662
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,280
issues

1663
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,200
how do you do it differently if you

1664
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,280
don't mind data but i think that's the

1665
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,400
essential

1666
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,559
question actually uh

1667
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,039
there is if we need to stop this

1668
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,039
extravast

1669
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,520
neocapitalist model and try to find

1670
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,640
other creative ways of dealing with

1671
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,118
economic situations

1672
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,599
okay

1673
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,039
i

1674
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,280
i don't know if i just i don't see

1675
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,319
another from the public if you have any

1676
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,039
other question please no in the chat

1677
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,240
there is a

1678
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,799
and we have a little bit time because

1679
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:04,799
after us there is a break like

1680
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,480
so we are not really clogging the next

1681
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,359
presentation

1682
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:15,839
maybe all i would like to add something

1683
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,880
to these questions asked by the audience

1684
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,920
or to our questions in general

1685
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,640
not specifically uh um no

1686
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,238
no i was just like thinking like okay

1687
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,839
because like the the session is quite

1688
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,640
condensed one hour and

1689
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,399
with all the work that we are doing

1690
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,439
daily

1691
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,640
um

1692
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,279
as in reflection and as in practice and

1693
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,238
i just wonder like yeah how uh

1694
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,158
one of the cores of this how can we

1695
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,080
sustain this

1696
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,600
feminist internet and um i they're there

1697
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,560
i'm i'm i'm curious uh and it would be

1698
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,719
nice to continue these conversations on

1699
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,920
on other moments i think

1700
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,839
because we still have very

1701
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:08,080
precarious situation but for now maybe i

1702
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,120
can just wrap it up and or does somebody

1703
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,198
else still wants to

1704
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,600
have a last word

1705
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,319
uh well i i just quickly want to say

1706
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,279
that the privacy concerns and

1707
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,319
the problematics of tracking

1708
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,080
when it comes to family service i mean

1709
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,640
family service they are autonomous at

1710
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,799
least at the moment there are autonomous

1711
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:33,600
mostly and servers i don't know amazing

1712
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,479
family server if you do let me know

1713
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,040
so in that sense being autonomous and

1714
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,359
anti-capitalistic

1715
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,359
in inherited

1716
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,839
embedded kind of politics

1717
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,759
and of course there is no

1718
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,679
tracking

1719
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:52,880
i call it

1720
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,400
mechanisms

1721
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,080
in the work we do

1722
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,560
we our own servers or the family service

1723
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,159
in general we know

1724
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:02,000
about

1725
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,360
and

1726
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,199
next to that to go a little bit more

1727
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,199
broader uh

1728
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:07,920
well

1729
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,960
when

1730
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,080
we talk about servers autonomous servers

1731
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,000
we

1732
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,040
they use as we can have it's also a

1733
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,880
small pool of uses we cannot scale up

1734
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,000
to you know to the big platforms like

1735
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
twitter or

1736
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,440
other

1737
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,120
similar

1738
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,480
platform so

1739
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,919
being small and

1740
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,040
having frequencies we want to host

1741
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,760
and makes location between the users

1742
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,880
and

1743
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,960
the sysadmins much more flowing

1744
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,760
and

1745
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,159
turns can be resolved faster and also

1746
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,520
privacy

1747
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,600
if either is privacy concerns or

1748
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,040
trolling

1749
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,360
you know attacks online etc

1750
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,199

residency

1761
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,520

email server

1765
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,280
that compiles access requests and puts

1766
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,800
pressure on institution to uh transform

1767
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,120
their relationship to access in specific

1768
