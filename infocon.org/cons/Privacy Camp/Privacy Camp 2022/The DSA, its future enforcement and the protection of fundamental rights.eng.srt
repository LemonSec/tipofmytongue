some quick opening remarks on the

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,280

try to refresh the page it says

77
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
something with your microphone maybe you

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,639
technology doesn't have to be perfect

really sorry no i mean

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
it worked at the beginning and it just

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
stopped

91
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
the moment

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,360
we waited like so please please uh

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,080
thanks so much yoris for uh

94
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
opening the session and everybody

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
including in the audience uh for for

96
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
waiting a couple of minutes now

97
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,919
uh so i will just say a few words to to

98
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
introduce

99
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,280
the substance of of this session

100
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,639
so

101
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,560
the main idea

102
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
behind

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
the panel

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,000
session today and the very many

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,600
questions that uh it wants to explore uh

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
is the idea of creating a space for

107
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
discussion

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,759
for one of the most

109
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,080
central aspects

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
of the dsa process

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
which is the question of its future

112
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
enforcement

113
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,199
within the framework that is now uh

114
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
taking shape

115
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
uh in in the discussions

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,560
um and the question of whether um

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,520
these rules uh will be capable to

118
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
deliver a high level of protection

119
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,599
of fundamental rights and other

120
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
democratic values

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
uh so this topic of dsa enforcement uh

122
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
despite being uh

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,880
clearly

124
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
one of the most prominent of of the

125
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
proposal

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,120
uh

127
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
and and very central as to whether the

128
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
the dsa will or not

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
achieving the future its policy

130
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,680
objectives

131
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,639
um

132
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,919
has not uh received a lot of attention

133
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
over the past months because uh other

134
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
topics also rightfully uh have taken

135
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,199
center stage and and this topic has been

136
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
a bit overshadowed by by other

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
issues

138
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,039
so

139
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,720
the reason why we think it's really

140
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
really important that we talk about

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
enforcement today

142
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,120
is because we know

143
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
particularly from experience with the

144
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
enforcement of gdpr

145
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,080
that even the most ambitious

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
set of rules

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
do not

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
translate automatically in high level of

149
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,919
protection of fundamental rights

150
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,759
without

151
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,320
strong and consistent

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
enforcement

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,750
structures

154
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,880
[Music]

155
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
and there is no doubt in this case that

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
uh the the

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
the many shortcomings the failures in

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
the enforcement of gdpr

159
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
uh he influenced heavily

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
uh the the dsa discussions starting from

161
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
the the first commission proposal to the

162
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
following

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
uh negotiations um particularly with

164
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720
this idea of

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
a more uh centralized

166
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
commission enforcement

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
against uh dominant platforms

168
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
emerging

169
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
really as um

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
the most

171
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,640
promising solution uh to try to avoid

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,959
the reoccurrence of some of the biggest

173
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,800
failures uh that happened with the

174
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
enforcement of gdpr

175
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,920
and

176
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
and the rationale behind this type of

177
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
choice is is very clear is

178
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,640
understandable but we think

179
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,920
it also raises a couple of complex and

180
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,399
interesting questions that are very

181
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
worth uh discussing today and in the

182
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
coming months

183
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,519
um

184
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
now when it comes to uh enforcement uh

185
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
against um

186
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,880
big platforms uh one of the most

187
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
interesting aspects uh concerns

188
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,279
uh

189
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,360
the supervision and enforcement of their

190
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,839
obligations to uh identify and to

191
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,399
mitigate uh systemic societal risks and

192
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
in particular we saw over the past

193
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,279
months uh over the last few days last

194
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,760
week in particular that

195
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
systemic issues um

196
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,839
such as that connected to business model

197
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
choices and uh

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
surveillance-based advertising uh really

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,839
emerged at some of as some of the most

200
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,160
heated uh topics

201
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,079
uh in in in the entire dsa discussion

202
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,320
um and these are all questions on which

203
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
the uh parliament report from last week

204
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,920
uh takes a more ambitious stance

205
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
compared to the commission and the

206
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
council's text and and we'll talk about

207
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,120
this um from this perspective uh we

208
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
think that one of the most interesting

209
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,360
questions for today

210
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
um is certainly the question of whether

211
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,279
uh the the dsa provisions and

212
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,240
particularly the risk

213
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
systemic risk management mechanism

214
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,959
where enforced properly

215
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,920
has the potential to deliver a high

216
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
level of protection fundamental rights

217
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,440
and other

218
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,240
democratic values

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
including with regard to

220
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
some of the most

221
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
striking distortions

222
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,680
and violations of fundamental rights

223
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
that are brought about

224
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
uh by uh some um

225
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,320
uh business models uh dynamics

226
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
and and more in general another question

227
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,079
we'd like to to discuss with you today

228
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,440
is the question

229
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
uh of the potential challenges that we

230
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
can already identify and anticipate

231
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,240
today

232
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
uh with respect to the implementation

233
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
and the enforcement

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,920
of of the dsa um so i think i've spoken

235
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
enough uh i will

236
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,120
speak further

237
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
uh to not take away any um

238
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
uh more precious time from the

239
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,560
conversation with our speakers

240
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
as

241
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,040
yoris already said in the introduction

242
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,079
we have

243
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,200
four

244
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
a great panelists today and they all

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,399
have

246
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,760
outstanding

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
experience

248
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
both in the dsa and in the gdpr

249
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,800
debates um so i'm now giving the floor

250
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
to our first

251
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,839
speaker today

252
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
jana goath

253
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,519
jana is legal and policy advisor to

254
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
mep alexandre giese uh janna you've been

255
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,900
super busy over the past months

256
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,079
[Music]

257
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
over the past year with the dsa

258
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
negotiations just back from

259
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
last week's plenary in strasbourg uh so

260
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,040
we are very

261
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,920
curious to hear uh from you from your

262
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,200
vantage point on the dsa

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
what's your impression of the dsa

264
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,120
enforcement chapter uh the floor is

265
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
yours

266
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
yes thank you

267
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
um so i very much agree with one of the

268
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,920
first things that you said and that is

269
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
that this entire enforcement chapter

270
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
received way too little attention over

271
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,320
the over the last months both in public

272
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,519
discourse

273
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
as well in my view within the

274
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
negotiations because we appreciate it

275
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,160
chronologically from front to end um of

276
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
the dsa and i think about the same which

277
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
naturally led to the enforcement chapter

278
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
being one of the very last things being

279
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
negotiated and discussed

280
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
and as you might have as you might know

281
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
um there was a huge time pressure on the

282
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
repertoire to uh bring the file to to a

283
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,399
close

284
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,760
so uh and in my humble view i don't i

285
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
think we could have spent more time uh

286
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
debating these things and negotiating on

287
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,199
these uh on these issues than than we

288
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,160
did

289
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
uh in particular as i completely agree

290
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
as well that we

291
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
we had to learn from our experience with

292
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
gdpr in my prayer life

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
before i joined ms giza as a policy

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
advisor i was working at a lawyer and

295
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
advising

296
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,160
big tech clients on uh well on

297
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
on gdpr and also vis-a-vis the dpas and

298
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,800
uh proceedings that they had with them

299
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
so i was able to draw from that

300
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,120
experience and trying to bring it into

301
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
in particular how we can how we can

302
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
improve enforcement under the dsa

303
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,560
which was one of uh one of

304
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,240
the green's main priorities for the file

305
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
so what we did

306
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,680
procedurally internally was uh

307
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,680
really take a close look and to into

308
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
what gdpr offers in this regard and then

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
draw our conclusions from there and base

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
uh based on the experience there

311
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
try to translate that into a better

312
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
enforcement chapter um for for the dsa

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
so uh the first thing that we thought

314
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,240
needed fixing in comparison to gdpr was

315
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,079
that we felt the need to introduce fixed

316
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,680
deadlines for every step of the

317
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
proceedings wherever possible this is

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
something that that we've seen in

319
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,920
regards to ireland i personally for

320
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,320
example watched a complaint

321
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
with uh with my respective dpa in

322
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,680
germany

323
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,880
um

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
together with none of your none of your

325
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,920
business back in 2018 actually already

326
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
and we haven't heard yet

327
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
from from the irish dpa there isn't even

328
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
a first draft decision and that is

329
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
because there's no fixed deadline for

330
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
them to actually come up with one of

331
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,399
those

332
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
draft decisions so we can't even

333
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,800
go to court yet we can't appeal a

334
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,440
decision that isn't in existence yet

335
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
so uh that was that was one thing that

336
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
we as parliament did uh

337
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
amend in comparison to the commission

338
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
draft as well was to to just introduce

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,639
deadlines everywhere where they were

340
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
missing they were already lots of them

341
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,399
in there the commission obviously also

342
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,560
did their work and uh also saw this

343
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
problem already we just touched up on

344
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
some on some aspects of that in this

345
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
regard

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,680
and then um

347
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,360
the second uh big topic that

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,959
all institutions

349
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
in fact tackled was that

350
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
a bit more centralization in regards to

351
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,880
enforcement does not do us any harm here

352
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
of course we have the country of origin

353
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
principle and of course also under the

354
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
dsa

355
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
in principle the the digital service

356
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
coding establishment shall be

357
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,880
uh shall be in power of the proceedings

358
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,279
that's clear but in particular in

359
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
regards to the very large online

360
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
platforms we felt the need that we

361
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
there's there's uh

362
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,320
there's

363
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
the real need for more centralized

364
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
enforcement a because

365
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,720
obviously like these uh these issue

366
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
issues are naturally cross-border they

367
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,320
touch upon every member state citizen's

368
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,759
interest

369
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
but b that's also something you might

370
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
have seen with ireland in regards to

371
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
gdpr is that

372
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,639
sometimes the member states uh financial

373
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,519
interests can be so intertwined with

374
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,760
the financial interests of the of the

375
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
tech companies doing their business

376
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
there if there are thousands and

377
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,319
thousands of jobs depending on these

378
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,919
companies having their main

379
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,280
establishment there

380
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,039
that it might not be the wisest decision

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,079
to

382
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,079
lay basically all enforcing powers onto

383
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,880
them

384
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,959
uh and uh c of course we will need a

385
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
huge pool of uh technically uh legally

386
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,520
very

387
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,559
um

388
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,160
very expert

389
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
people to be able to work on these

390
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
enforcement

391
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,679
questions so

392
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,559
uh we for example the screens we pushed

393
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,840
for having an actual eu

394
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
platform agency that should be in charge

395
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,720
for the enforcement these are the the

396
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,240
very large online platforms and in

397
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
regards to their special obligations

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
that didn't find a majority

399
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
unfortunately so um we are

400
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,320
in this regard more or less still

401
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,760
with the with the commission proposal

402
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
where the commission will do some of

403
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
these uh

404
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
will have some of these powers um i

405
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
think we can talk more about this in

406
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,120
detail later there of course uh benefits

407
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
and uh

408
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
cons to

409
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
to having the commission to

410
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,679
do these tasks but overall in general i

411
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
would say it's a good development that

412
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
we're aiming for a bit more

413
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
centralization

414
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,919
in regards to enforcement

415
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,799
and maybe as a last general remark which

416
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,240
i think we can also touch upon later and

417
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
more in detail is that um if you compare

418
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
the three texts that we have now so the

419
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,080
commission text the uh parliament

420
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,799
section the council text is um

421
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
actually a combination of all three of

422
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
them uh would would bring us benefits

423
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,120
right now classically of course the ep

424
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
is always um

425
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
yeah maybe a bit bashing the

426
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
commission's sorry the countless

427
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
proposals

428
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
but uh here for the dsa

429
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,000
um the council

430
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,760
in my league or in the greenfield that

431
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
um did good work uh on the enforcement

432
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,440
chapter and there lots of good

433
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
provisions in there strengthening for

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,240
example the commission uh enforcement

435
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,440
that we and

436
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
ep techs are lacking on the counter side

437
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
and the ep tax we have some

438
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
some some fixed deadlines introduced

439
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,679
that were lacking in the

440
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,440
in the council draft and also as you

441
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
mentioned ellaria the provisions on the

442
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
risk assessment and the audits which uh

443
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,080
of course would be great if they would

444
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
find um

445
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,640
their way into the trilog text so uh it

446
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
really remains to be seen what we end up

447
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
with after trialog and i think they're

448
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
very good aspects and all uh three texts

449
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,799
that if we if we achieve to combine them

450
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,039
i think we're left with something um

451
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,200
pretty effective yes

452
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,160
great

453
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
thank you very much and it does sound

454
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,600
like you did actually do quite a lot of

455
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
work uh but of course maybe some of

456
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,679
those uh enforcement discussions are

457
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,919
rather technical and not so easy also to

458
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,799
translate to a bigger audience paul

459
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,160
paul nemet's principal advisor at the

460
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
justice at the european commission the

461
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,080
floor is yours for your opening remarks

462
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
yes thank you very much uh first of all

463
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
i would say like on gdpr we are really

464
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,159
here in a finding process

465
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,919
uh where the institutions uh engage

466
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,880
um

467
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
and i really mean this you know for

468
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
example in gdpr if you remember the

469
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,480
commission actually didn't dare to in

470
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
its original proposal to have to propose

471
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
anything where there was a strong center

472
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
it was a very weak center in the

473
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
original proposal and then the member

474
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
states in the council

475
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
develop these thoughts about you know

476
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,679
what does it mean if we have complete

477
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,679
decentralization you know given the fact

478
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,520
that google and others sit in ireland

479
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,799
you know how is that going to work for

480
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,280
our citizens and this is how

481
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,559
um let's say the powers of

482
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,840
the data protection board were created

483
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,559
to

484
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,280
give

485
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
let's say binding decisions on the

486
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
weight forward in in some cases

487
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,480
and i see the same type of constructive

488
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
engagement now uh on dsa

489
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,159
and i would agree that in uh

490
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
both of the tax parliament and council

491
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,640
there are really steps forward and

492
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
um

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,159
i think the the commission is very much

494
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,159
looking forward to seeing sort of you

495
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880
know this constructive attitude continue

496
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,159
in the end

497
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,480
uh i would say all institutions are in

498
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
it here to make

499
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,000
things work

500
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
and

501
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,120
that is a big challenge in this new

502
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
world and um

503
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
let's say um

504
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
you know we have to push as far as we

505
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,240
can

506
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,039
but

507
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,360
i would also say you know without

508
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
thinking that there is this or that

509
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
perfect solution i think

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,679
in particular comparisons to gdpr

511
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
they are helpful to some extent

512
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,080
and but i would caution against

513
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
let's say and and you know the tonality

514
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
is sometimes a little bit like that a

515
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
discourse which is you know oh you know

516
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
gdpr doesn't function and now we have to

517
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,760
draw the consequences the opposite is

518
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,640
true

519
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,440
if you look at the fines uh you know we

520
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
just have a year behind us where the

521
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
fines have very substantially increased

522
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,679
and they will further increase

523
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,480
we have now an upward uh competition you

524
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
know the u.s is still leading with a

525
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,600
billion fine uh two two two billions of

526
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,559
facebook fine from the ftc

527
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,240
but um

528
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,200
complex enforcement systems

529
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,679
first of all are never perfect if from a

530
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
scientific point of view or from this or

531
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,039
that political point of view never

532
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,159
and and they need some time to fall into

533
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,120
the kinetics and i think the kinetics

534
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
um

535
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,120
in the in the gdpr system are good in

536
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
the sense that there is a real threat

537
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
that these central authorities

538
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
can act and they they are starting to

539
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,440
learn this

540
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,880
and if the lead authority is not acting

541
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
so um

542
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
i would say there are also some other

543
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
things which are not parallel and that's

544
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
important to keep in mind so first of

545
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,679
all we don't have

546
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,919
the issue or the problem of this

547
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,520
multiplication of

548
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,520
constitutional level independence of an

549
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,720
authority

550
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,799
you know that is a blessing on the one

551
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,600
hand but it's also a problem because you

552
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
know if you have constitutional

553
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,559
independence

554
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,440
you know it makes people think they are

555
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
you know

556
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,400
the only ones who have an interest here

557
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
and this obstacle we don't have the in

558
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,559
the dsa so we can think about an

559
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,240
institutional setting

560
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,360
uh which

561
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
which which works

562
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,679
but which does not create this um

563
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,919
you know this this very special class of

564
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
constitutionally protected independence

565
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
you know and this discourse for example

566
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
which was very much in the gdpr

567
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,440
discussions

568
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
against the commission

569
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
huge mistake i mean the commission is

570
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,679
the most independent body of all

571
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,279
according to the treaty if you if you

572
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
look at the rules of the treaty the

573
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
commission is very independent which

574
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
leads me to a second point

575
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
you know the good old discussion do we

576
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,559
need a body outside of the commission to

577
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,120
enforce or inside i think there are as

578
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
jana said you know this is an old

579
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,679
discussion on competition and on other

580
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,120
subjects

581
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,480
um

582
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,080
i do believe

583
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,120
it's a huge fallacy to think

584
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
that every time we create a new

585
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,039
institution everything becomes better

586
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
you know the the opposite is true and we

587
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
can see this for example in the split

588
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
between the commission and the external

589
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,840
action service and i would also say here

590
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,520
you know to create yet another

591
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,720
institution it will only multiply

592
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,960
the number of actors and that in itself

593
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
is nothing good

594
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
in a world

595
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,400
where the platform economy

596
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,120
uses multi-purpose technology namely ai

597
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,799
it will be everywhere

598
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,520
and is multi-sided so i would say we

599
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,679
have to think the other way

600
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,240
we have to start thinking

601
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
about moving away

602
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,559
from this you know civil servants dash

603
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,799
politicians hobby that you know for my

604
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,080
file i also create my institution yeah

605
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,039
that is the old way for the old economy

606
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,279
of thinking about enforcement

607
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,480
and you know this has been done in all

608
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,480
areas of eu law whenever there's a legal

609
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,760
act on consumers on equal opportunities

610
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
on data protection on telecom and this

611
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,720
that we create an institution with it

612
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,279
and now we have in the platform digital

613
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
economy we have so many actors they all

614
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
have the same clients you know

615
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,919
the platforms are clients of all these

616
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,360
regulators

617
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
and it's a mess

618
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
so i must say i'm quite happy if we can

619
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,559
move forward in this proposal and leave

620
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
this thing with a commission because

621
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,360
then the commission does at least

622
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,440
competition and this

623
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
and it's a unitary body and that's a

624
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,159
huge

625
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,400
progress that is not a weakness that is

626
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,880
a strength look at the ftc in america

627
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,200
they are now i would say

628
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
lucky enough to have consumer protection

629
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,080
privacy and competition in one house

630
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,200
because

631
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
it also has one huge advantage

632
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,679
you know the guys

633
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,600
the other guys are learning from the

634
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,919
hardcore competition guys you know and

635
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,080
that is an advantage

636
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
so i would plead for maintaining it

637
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,520
this way

638
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,320
and

639
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,880
the last remark on

640
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,600
making sure we have to move to the next

641
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,679
yeah the last remark on making things

642
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,640
work

643
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
when an institution is in place because

644
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
that's not the only issue we also have

645
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,520
to think about mechanisms which ensure

646
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
that the institution afterwards is under

647
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
legal pressure to work

648
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,840
um and in gdpr the big progress in

649
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,679
comparison to the directive was that we

650
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,000
have created a right of the citizen to a

651
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
decision and by the way i don't agree

652
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,039
with jana that you know if you have been

653
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,720
waiting for three years you can actually

654
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
bring a case

655
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
um you don't need a fixed deadline

656
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
written

657
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,640
in a text to be able to bring a case for

658
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,320
non-action

659
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,120
so

660
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
let's not only have an institutional

661
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,880
discussion but let's think about

662
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
kinetics what triggers what and how can

663
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
we motivate the institution which then

664
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,360
is the enforcer also to act afterwards

665
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,559
that we have to work on too

666
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,080
thank you thank you very much and that

667
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,840
is of course the dynamic we see also

668
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,240
with the gdpr that there is a lot of

669
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
pressure also in particular from uh you

670
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,360
know ngos and individuals absolutely

671
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,200
functioning of the system and that is a

672
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
very interesting feature also maybe to

673
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,559
to to make a comparison uh elishkai

674
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
you're you're next please

675
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,039
uh thank you very much i hope that

676
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,000
everyone can hear me well um and please

677
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,120
those who had some technical

678
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
difficulties at the beginning don't

679
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,240
worry about it i'm usually the one who

680
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
has the biggest difficulties with big

681
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,159
blue buttons so i'm giving the warning

682
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,000
in advance if there is any technical

683
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,960
glitch

684
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,240
um so i agree with many points that have

685
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,799
already been raised and

686
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,640
axes now together with other civil

687
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
societies very much agree with the point

688
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,520
that enforcement mechanism of the essay

689
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
was sort of a side track topic from the

690
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
beginning and we actually issued the

691
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
position on the how in our view the

692
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,960
enforcement mechanism should look like

693
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,120
even before the the essay was actually

694
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
launched

695
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
and many other civil society players

696
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,320
were thinking how to actually learn from

697
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,880
the past gdpr mistakes that the

698
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,159
legislation that is also often called a

699
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,480
legislative success but unfortunately to

700
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,840
a large extent enforcement failure

701
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,480
and and many other elements were already

702
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
named by academia and other players in

703
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
the field why that's the case uh besides

704
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,039
the lack of funding and adequate

705
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
resources provided to data protection

706
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
authorities at the national level the

707
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
issue is much more complex with the

708
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
problematic uh so-called one-stop-shop

709
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
mechanism and also the lack of

710
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
harmonization between these national

711
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,039
procedures

712
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
access now regularly published a report

713
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,559
uh on enforcement of the gdpr

714
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
and this is the ongoing research that is

715
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,360
being updated on yearly basis and we

716
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,440
identified throughout these years four

717
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,399
main reasons why we see gdpr enforcement

718
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,120
mechanism lagging behind and these

719
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,919
precisely four bases are a good start

720
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,640
for uh the future of the dsa to actually

721
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,520
learn from so these are definitely the

722
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
inadequate communication exchange

723
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,679
between these national authorities then

724
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,760
of course the lack of strict deadlines

725
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
to answer the requests for investigation

726
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,320
and enforcement that is already somehow

727
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
mitigated by the dsa and i definitely

728
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
agree with jana then a lot of progress

729
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,279
has been done by the european parliament

730
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,679
in that sense and there is of course

731
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,279
still differences and some level of

732
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,960
contradictions between the national

733
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,600
procedures and finally ongoing

734
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
difficulty with detrimenting companies

735
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,919
main establishment so we have irish

736
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
problem so the issue of corporate

737
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
capture we have the luxembourgish

738
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,559
problem and some commentators also point

739
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
out to those countries that are

740
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
currently experiencing so-called

741
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
democratic backsliding without pointing

742
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
a finger into any concrete directions

743
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,120
where we often see that in the field of

744
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,799
the content governance

745
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,240
when it comes to the appointment of

746
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
future digital coordinators often these

747
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
actually falls on the existing media

748
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,600
regulators within the member states of

749
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,919
the european union that have ever

750
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,320
similarly to some dpas like the enough

751
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,720
resources or even experience with the

752
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
platform government issue and content

753
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,559
governance issues

754
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,960
so all of these imposes a big question

755
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
mark and also a question what we can

756
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,919
realistically expect from the dsa as

757
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,080
these upcoming regulation that seeks to

758
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
change the platform governance within

759
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
the eu as we know it and what kind of

760
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
basis for this enforcement are truly

761
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,039
realistic

762
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,880
um so uh dsa just to quickly wrap up

763
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,640
something that doesn't really have to be

764
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,039
elaborated further for anyone um in this

765
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,600
panel is that there are sort of layered

766
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,760
system of the enforcement there is a

767
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,519
system at the national member states

768
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,840
level uh that to a large extent does

769
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,039
follow the example set by the gdpr so it

770
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,039
creates also the coordinate coordinator

771
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,519
of the establishment

772
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,240
but it also mitigates certain things

773
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
that we identified with the gdpr that

774
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
are actually creating all these

775
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
obstacles within the enforcement and

776
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
what i would like to pay specific

777
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,320
attention today is that enforcement

778
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
layer over the very large online

779
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,240
platforms where precisely the

780
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,880
enforcement mechanism of dsa relies on

781
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
the more centralized role of the

782
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,240
european commission

783
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,480
and we as civil societies are always

784
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,519
here to

785
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,679
make sure that accountability systems

786
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,919
and independence of public authorities

787
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
is in place and that there is enough

788
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,320
meaningful transparency not only imposed

789
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
on the online platforms but also on

790
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,960
individual member states and the way how

791
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,039
they actually exercise these enforcement

792
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,000
mechanisms and while i agree that to

793
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,919
some extent centralization might be

794
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,600
necessary i

795
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
disagree slightly with the point that

796
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,399
european commission is uh

797
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,399
so much independent first and foremost

798
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,559
european commission is the executive

799
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,240
branch of the euro of the european

800
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,600
union's power

801
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,679
and and we still impose more and more

802
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,519
question what part of the commission or

803
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
the unit the independent monitoring unit

804
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,480
will be actually responsible for what

805
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,880
parts of the enforcement especially when

806
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,039
they exercise monitoring over very large

807
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
online platforms

808
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
and we do see a need for such a more

809
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,840
centralized independent body and that's

810
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,240
something that i also want to underline

811
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,799
and whether that will be in the form of

812
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
european platform super agency or

813
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,840
whether it will actually look a bit

814
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
differently that's also something we

815
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,679
need to actually address and answer in

816
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,960
the following months years to come

817
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
nevertheless i think it's extremely

818
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
important to distinguish what such a

819
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,279
centralized enforcement can do and can

820
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,519
oversight and in our review we

821
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,799
definitely see the space for creation of

822
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,519
a public independent auditor someone who

823
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,240
can actually really oversight how very

824
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,240
large online platforms comply with their

825
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
due diligence obligations whether this

826
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
is connected to the risk assessment or

827
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,880
conducting independent audits

828
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
or even to administer the access

829
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
framework that currently exists under

830
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,840
dsa framework which is the only way how

831
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,519
to actually establish a proper

832
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,320
accountability mechanism on all of these

833
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,120
we definitely need to create such a body

834
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,360
that would actually hold these oversight

835
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
functions but we are not exactly sure

836
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,640
whether it's a good or realistic idea to

837
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,799
bring all of those other enforcement

838
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
functions under the one umbrella of one

839
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
centralized institution because it might

840
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
as well actually create the problems

841
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,239
that we all know but in the center of

842
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,520
brussels

843
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,159
um so this would be just first

844
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,040
introductory works um and i'm happy to

845
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,719
continue this further in the

846
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,399
conversation

847
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,960
thank you thank you that was great um so

848
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,280
we'll quickly go to our final uh speaker

849
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,199
for his opening remarks please elliot

850
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,199
the floor is yours

851
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,119
thank you and uh thank you for inviting

852
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,079
me i have much less expertise on the dsa

853
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,560
than my co-panelists so i'm instead

854
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,199
going to cover uh previous international

855
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,000
experience with gdpr enforcement uh in

856
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,159
particular in the field of ad tech

857
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,760
so back in 2018 when gdpr came into

858
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,679
force uh we've led a month long um work

859
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,000
um submitting a number of data subject

860
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,199
access requests to date brokers at tech

861
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,400
companies and credit rating agencies um

862
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,560
in order to investigate their

863
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,359
data processing practices and

864
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,400
we found a number of issues with what

865
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,160
all of these companies were doing which

866
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,280
ended up basically with us submitting

867
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
seven complaints

868
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
uh in europe to three data protection

869
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,240
agencies in france the uk and ireland

870
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,880
and uh among those complaints only a few

871
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
actually led to investigation so the

872
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,880
irish dpc for example

873
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,800
started an investigation on comcast

874
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,359
friends started one on critero but among

875
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,680
all of us only one actually ended up in

876
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,359
some sort of enforcement and that was

877
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,240
the ico uh in the middle of last year

878
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
that uh um

879
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,079
sorry launched an uh

880
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,160
an enforcement notice against a number

881
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
of credit rating agencies in the uk

882
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,800
but even then this enforcement hasn't

883
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,079
actually been followed up experian

884
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,760
one of the credit rating agencies that

885
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
was being investigated appealed this

886
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
decision and they were in a hearing last

887
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,760
year so

888
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,440
we literally haven't seen any form of

889
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,599
enforcement on this side now more

890
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,440
recently over the past two years we've

891
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,839
been doing technical research on uh

892
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,400
publishers so websites uh that are kind

893
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,160
of the front end of uh tracking based um

894
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,119
targeted advertising so we've looked at

895
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,880
website dealing with mental health more

896
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,800
specifically with depressions and more

897
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,960
recently we've looked at websites

898
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,119
that were publishing diet

899
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,560
related ads

900
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,359
and

901
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,200
this resource was basically focused on

902
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,359
looking at the number of trackers that

903
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,000
were on this website by default without

904
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
any sort of human interaction

905
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
uh and we looked at the data that was

906
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,280
being collected in quizzes and surveys

907
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,839
so for example in the first research we

908
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,599
looked at depression tests offered by

909
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
these websites and where the answers

910
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,520
offered by

911
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
users were going and what we found is

912
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,160
that a number of this websites actually

913
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,040
share

914
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,200
direct answers with third parties that

915
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
are unnamed without any form of consent

916
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,720
that is being requested beforehand

917
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
um and again we submitted a complaint

918
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,960
notably against taxi simo

919
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
one of the biggest health related

920
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,720
website in france

921
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,760
and um despite having regulators telling

922
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,920
us that investigations have started uh

923
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,839
we haven't seen any kind of enforcement

924
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,320
now the good side of this story is that

925
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
because this research got a little bit

926
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,000
of media attention

927
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,680
companies actually changed their

928
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,760
practices but that's not enforcement in

929
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
the sense we're talking about today

930
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,800
um

931
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,640
so it's it for us it's pretty

932
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,640
problematic

933
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,599
sorry

934
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,359
you started breaking up just the last

935
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,000
sentences

936
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,720
okay

937
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
um is it okay now yeah i think you're

938
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,000
back yeah

939
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,640
all right so uh to conclude basically

940
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
for us we see three main reasons

941
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
attempting to

942
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
incur what elisa

943
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
the reasons for it is that um

944
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,520
agencies have limited resources they

945
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,119
they keep telling us that they keep

946
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,720
telling us that they're investigating a

947
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,160
number of issues at the same time and

948
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,320
it's hard for them to focus on something

949
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,720
uh we've also observed a lot of uh lack

950
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,040
of coordination between data protection

951
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,200
agencies and it's really a shame when

952
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
we're looking at actors like data

953
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,040
brokers or tech companies who have like

954
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,000
a global presence and uh whose case

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
would need to be assessed by uh multiple

956
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,200
regulators at the same time and finally

957
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
uh we just says that the complexity of

958
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,079
the wants uh once

959
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,440
it's

960
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,000
hard for regulators to again coordinate

961
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,680
and uh

962
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,599
and basically take action against these

963
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,920
uh global companies so

964
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,640
yeah that's that's it for me i think

965
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,960
thank you thank you very much uh just a

966
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
quick note your your camera is also

967
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,200
frozen i i don't it's it's it's fine

968
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
your picture is fine that you're seeing

969
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,359
but uh maybe you want to try to to get

970
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,440
it to work again

971
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,320
so

972
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
that was uh that was really quite a lot

973
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,000
uh put on the table so maybe maybe i

974
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,560
want to kick off with one uh with one

975
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,040
question about how uh how you're all

976
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,000
imagining uh you know this new kind of

977
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,480
digital service coordinator entities and

978
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,119
also the new kind of european level

979
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,520
enforcement agencies which type of

980
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,200
people uh should we see within uh those

981
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,480
uh agencies you know like this is a this

982
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
is it's not uh data protection

983
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
enforcement data protection enforcement

984
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,079
had a long history you know with uh of

985
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,920
rules and and i mean those those

986
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
agencies existed for a long time but

987
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
those uh you know unfortunate

988
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
enforcement structures for the dsa it is

989
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,839
somewhat of a new uh beast with

990
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,200
different types of expertise also being

991
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
needed

992
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,599
so

993
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,640
what is your what is your imagination uh

994
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,960
in terms of those institutions you know

995
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
what kind of expertise what kind of

996
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,079
but what what what which what should we

997
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,680
expect and what should we hope for and

998
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,200
what should we wish for and what should

999
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
we maybe be be worried about

1000
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,160
uh when thinking about those uh those

1001
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,400
agencies that maybe like as a question

1002
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,200
to

1003
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,040
to bring it to life a little bit too

1004
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,119
because in the end there's going to be

1005
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,079
people

1006
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,960
in those in those agencies having to do

1007
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,280
certain work and and creating a

1008
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,160
favorable enforcement environment for

1009
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,680
the whole ecosystem in europe

1010
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,830
who would like to pick up on that

1011
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,989
[Music]

1012
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,079
well i can

1013
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,000
give you my experience from gdpr here

1014
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,119
um

1015
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,079
it is actually a huge problem that

1016
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,119
many of the data protection authorities

1017
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,760
are run by people who have absolutely no

1018
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
enforcement background and the fact that

1019
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,119
these authorities are old it doesn't

1020
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,280
change anything there was a gentle woman

1021
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,079
in gentleman's culture before gdpr you

1022
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,000
know we have a cup of coffee we agree

1023
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,520
and basically

1024
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
no judgments which were of contentious

1025
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,079
nature whatsoever

1026
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,000
which tells you everything about you

1027
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,880
know

1028
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,839
let's keep life

1029
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,240
nice and so i have always said we have

1030
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,119
to change this culture for for dpas we

1031
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,079
need you know former prosecutors you

1032
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,680
know deputy head of the competition

1033
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,960
authority we need people who are ready

1034
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
for conflict and ready to go for a hard

1035
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,480
hand but also who know how to document

1036
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,640
evidence and how to do investigations

1037
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,319
and enforcement work in such a way that

1038
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,960
it stands in a court

1039
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,560
and i think we need this type of people

1040
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,839
in the dsa enforcement

1041
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,200
bodies and coordinators bodies too

1042
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,240
and i think there will be some

1043
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
more discussions about this because you

1044
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,200
know the vex thing is that dsa there's

1045
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
also an element of industrial policy

1046
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
always in the background and you know

1047
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,960
let's talk and be nice

1048
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,480
but i would say look guys you know we

1049
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,359
have learned ethics doesn't do it and

1050
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,119
talking you know and being nice with

1051
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,560
each other no

1052
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,800
we need if we make laws

1053
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,400
we need heart enforcement readiness

1054
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,119
not unreasonable hardness but readiness

1055
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,920
and so that means we need people who are

1056
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,720
able and willing to stand the conflict

1057
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
and who are able and who know and who

1058
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,160
have the professionalism to investigate

1059
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,800
in such a way that they are able to take

1060
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,640
a tough enforcement decision and then

1061
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,599
also win in court and that is a

1062
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,240
different type of person than those who

1063
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,119
love to give the others next speech at

1064
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,839
the school and the university and inform

1065
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,079
and go to the next conference of all the

1066
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,599
dsa enforcers and talky talky talky

1067
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,560
so i would say we need people of action

1068
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,280
you want uh you want an enforcer with

1069
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,119
some teeth at least uh jana absolutely

1070
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,040
you want jana you wanted to come in as

1071
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,599
well on this

1072
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,160
yeah if i can answer that uh yes i think

1073
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
you already answered your own question

1074
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,920
partly uh

1075
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
and the name of the new enforcement

1076
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,839
agent the name of the enforcement

1077
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,359
entities are very fitting they're called

1078
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,720
coordinators

1079
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,319
and i think that is one of the biggest

1080
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,800
challenge that we might uh might face in

1081
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,440
the with the dsa enforcement in general

1082
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,200
is that as you said there is so many

1083
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,359
different uh backgrounds of expertise

1084
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,880
that we will need and i completely agree

1085
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,200
with uh with paul that of course at the

1086
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,720
head of these institutions we need

1087
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,560
people with teeth and with appetite for

1088
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,359
proper enforcement but all the um

1089
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,280
the entire hierarchy below of course we

1090
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
need the technical expertise we need

1091
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,079
people that

1092
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
have backgrounds in computer sciences we

1093
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,560
need people that have backgrounds and

1094
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
media regulations and so on and so forth

1095
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,079
and um the the dsa already foresees the

1096
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
possibility or the likelihood of there

1097
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,079
being more than one

1098
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,480
um competent authority per member state

1099
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,920
and says that they will just need to

1100
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,360
organize themselves and just have one

1101
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,520
[Music]

1102
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
one dsc that will also represent them at

1103
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,079
the board for example but that means

1104
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:16,960
that

1105
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,280
and in comparison to gdpr where we have

1106
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
a pretty clear-cut

1107
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,440
legal field that people can work and

1108
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,200
have been working and for

1109
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,240
for years um under the dsa we will have

1110
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,599
many uh

1111
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,359
fields of legal expertise for example

1112
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,079
that uh that are being concerned here so

1113
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,280
we will not only have um the issue of

1114
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,680
having to organ to coordinate

1115
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,359
between member states for example and

1116
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,680
joint investigations or coordinate at

1117
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
the board level

1118
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,040
we will also have

1119
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,240
this need for close cooperation within

1120
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,760
one member state

1121
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,079
between between many different already

1122
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,480
existing authorities some member states

1123
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
might create a new authority to be the

1124
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
dsc some might build up on existing

1125
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,520
authorities but in any case there will

1126
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,920
be many different authorities concerned

1127
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,520
on the member state level so we really

1128
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,280
need a close cooperation there and we've

1129
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,040
already seen from past experience that

1130
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,920
of course this is always cumbersome it's

1131
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
always a bit slow there's always this

1132
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,200
issue of

1133
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,280
basically translation between different

1134
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,560
authorities because they just have

1135
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,839
different working styles they have

1136
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,079
different approaches to things

1137
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:24,800
and

1138
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,000
i think this is something we will need

1139
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,319
to look out for

1140
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
elisha did you want to come in as well

1141
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,839
yes i i just would like to add to uh to

1142
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,359
those great points that have already

1143
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,119
been raised by two previous speakers

1144
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,720
that perhaps uh indeed uh the number of

1145
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,800
specializations and experts that will

1146
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,280
actually have to work on the enforcement

1147
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,440
of the dsa is quite large and that's

1148
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,520
another reason why in

1149
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,839
my view at least there is definitely

1150
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,880
considering or worth of considering to

1151
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,599
see

1152
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,520
on one hand enforcement over compliance

1153
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,160
with the obligations within the dsa that

1154
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,400
could be indeed left with some

1155
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,920
independent enforcement unit at the

1156
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,240
commission level and at the same time

1157
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,720
having actually that individual

1158
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,480
body so called we could call it

1159
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,160
transparency facilitator which is the

1160
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,839
term that comes from the algorithm watch

1161
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,599
for instance the organization that also

1162
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,240
proposes similar solution in that regard

1163
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,920
that would be then responsible for

1164
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,839
certain elements how to actually

1165
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,160
administer that password of meaningful

1166
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,839
transference that we all talk about and

1167
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,640
the dsa seeks to establish and there we

1168
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,960
can actually see and foresee the role

1169
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,200
for the sort of agency that could

1170
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,440
administer that because if we speak

1171
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,359
about independent auditing of platforms

1172
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,839
that is envisioned within the dsa that

1173
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
in itself is technically very

1174
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,720
complicated thing to actually enforce

1175
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,119
where if we want to actually use those

1176
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,960
independent outlets to the

1177
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,440
large possible extent we need several

1178
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,359
expert bodies to be able to actually

1179
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,200
contact those and at the same time a

1180
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,520
body that will be able to oversight how

1181
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,839
those exercises are being performed so

1182
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,000
we are not ending up with some checklist

1183
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,040
or completely privatized environment of

1184
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,520
audits that we saw also in the case of

1185
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,119
gdpr so um precisely due to that due to

1186
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,680
that large uh scope of different

1187
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,599
regulators and different necessary

1188
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,000
expertise in the place of the sa this

1189
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,599
would be actually one way how to think

1190
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,760
about it in the future so i think both

1191
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,400
actually have their uh you know deserved

1192
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,000
place when we discuss enforcement

1193
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,920
mechanism it's just that we should not

1194
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
try to create a body that wants to do

1195
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,200
too much at once

1196
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,119
elaria do you want to put the next

1197
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,920
question perhaps

1198
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,280
maybe uh since we don't have a lot of

1199
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,319
minutes left it would be good to

1200
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,559
open it up to the audience and maybe

1201
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
they're someone who wants to

1202
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,680
come forward with a question um

1203
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,839
there's an interesting question on

1204
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,119
the

1205
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,200
digital single market director from

1206
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,079
copyright how that relates to this

1207
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,640
discussion maybe someone would like to

1208
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,279
answer that

1209
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,680
not an easy question

1210
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,599
i think there was just a report from the

1211
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,440
european copyright society on the

1212
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,280
relationship between that directive and

1213
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,559
the dsa proposal

1214
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,920
some words to the

1215
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,960
sorry

1216
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,680
please go ahead

1217
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,880
of course the general uh the general

1218
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,440
interlink between these two

1219
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,599
regimes is a bit complicated in fact and

1220
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,520
there is a good report on this out there

1221
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,359
but in particular in terms of

1222
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,440
enforcement i don't think we have huge

1223
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,000
issues here because dsm is enforced uh

1224
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,920
purely i mean it's enforced on the

1225
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,440
member state level it's a director

1226
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,960
whereas it was transposed into member

1227
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,000
state law

1228
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,680
and um

1229
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,119
it's more about

1230
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,440
the content of things so as soon as we

1231
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,599
can clear up the interlink between those

1232
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,000
two uh regimes in general then i think

1233
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,400
we should also be fine uh on the

1234
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,000
enforcement side of things and then

1235
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,119
again

1236
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,040
of course at a member state level no

1237
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,800
matter who will be appointed to be the

1238
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,680
dsc of course the media regulators will

1239
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
play their role

1240
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,920
in the enforcement of the dsa as well

1241
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,680
at least in just giving input and

1242
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,839
expertise to the dsc if it's not them in

1243
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,200
the first place

1244
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,680
being the supervisory

1245
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
there there is a question about the

1246
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,319
importance of fines

1247
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,640
are there views on the importance of

1248
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,680
fines

1249
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,480
in all of this

1250
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,720
for your muted

1251
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,480
yeah

1252
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,240
you know i'll tell you an anecdote so

1253
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,559
while we were negotiating gdpr some of

1254
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,640
the big tech companies came to me and

1255
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
said oh you know we're never going to

1256
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,280
talk to the regulator if they can find

1257
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,000
us

1258
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,760
you know that's not good for nice

1259
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,280
conversation

1260
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,200
and

1261
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,040
and my answer was yeah sure that's why

1262
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
you constantly talk to dg competition

1263
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,800
which can find you 10 percent of world

1264
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,480
turnovers so actually

1265
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
uh you know i believe in the possibility

1266
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,400
of high fines

1267
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,280
uh it it is conducive to the dialogue

1268
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,960
with the um

1269
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,040
authority and it's also

1270
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,720
helpful um

1271
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,920
in making uh bringing about real change

1272
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,359
you know an enforcement nothing is

1273
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,400
perfect

1274
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
but you know better have the hard hand

1275
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,520
possibilities

1276
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,559
because

1277
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,800
you know nothing just changes because we

1278
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,760
have a nice coordination

1279
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,559
um

1280
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,280
so i i just also say one thing about

1281
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,599
this constant excitement in civil

1282
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
society about independence i think it's

1283
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,640
a huge misunderstanding

1284
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,880
independence from what from political

1285
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
oversight

1286
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,680
i mean hello

1287
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,800
normally

1288
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
all enforcement of law

1289
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,839
by public bodies is part of political

1290
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,520
responsibility

1291
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,559
so why are we giving the benefit

1292
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,640
to the digital economy and constantly

1293
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,440
say oh we need independent enforcement

1294
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,000
hello that means we are setting up weak

1295
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,680
bodies which are out there in the

1296
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,880
landscape

1297
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,200
instead of making them part

1298
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,720
of the pre-existing strong state

1299
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,319
i think that you know you guys you have

1300
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,800
to rethink this a little bit there is

1301
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,559
nothing good

1302
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,280
in this uh you know oh and another body

1303
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,800
which is independent and another body

1304
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,200
independent those they are just weak the

1305
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,280
normal enforcement you know think of tax

1306
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,559
enforcement

1307
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,599
think of

1308
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,520
the enforcement of you know future

1309
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,160
sanitary i mean any type of public law

1310
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,440
is normally enforced by the state full

1311
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,319
stop

1312
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,400
and there's a political responsibility

1313
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
of a minister that the enforcement takes

1314
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,240
place and they got to be tough

1315
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,559
yeah and in the moment you create an

1316
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,680
independent body you get this problem of

1317
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,000
these bodies out there and you know

1318
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,640
where is the line to democracy

1319
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,040
so i would say

1320
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,200
you know there is a misunderstanding

1321
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,720
this word independence it sounds great

1322
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,000
but it has a very limited positive

1323
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,040
function it can be very detrimental to

1324
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,800
create all these

1325
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,960
weak bodies outside the direct political

1326
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,720
accountability to parliament

1327
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,720
yeah i think i mean it's it's obviously

1328
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,040
um i mean there's there's some there's

1329
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,960
some some good reactions to that in the

1330
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,200
chat let maybe i'll let that

1331
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,720
kind of happen

1332
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,880
maybe just another point

1333
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,240
to bring up

1334
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,040
uh also considering uh what you said in

1335
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,920
the beginning elliot about uh you know

1336
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,280
your engagement with privacy

1337
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,359
international within the gdpr kind of

1338
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,400
enforcement ecosystem the dsa has a lot

1339
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,240
of this you know kind of it has this

1340
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,160
whole imagination of other actors

1341
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,000
playing an important role

1342
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,400
in uh the enforcement

1343
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,280
of the dsa uh there's a particular role

1344
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,680
also for academics they get

1345
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,680
no researchers they get

1346
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,480
potential access to certain data that

1347
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,960
they can start to use to do research

1348
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,839
about

1349
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,480
dynamics on dominant platforms i think

1350
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,040
there's also a role imagined uh for

1351
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,920
civil society so it's like it's really a

1352
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,400
bigger it's a bigger ecosystem of actors

1353
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,760
that that has to play uh some role uh in

1354
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,119
this so

1355
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,680
eliot could you speak to that uh

1356
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,920
and and and what do you think about

1357
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,520
the current uh

1358
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,680
situation and what is your experience

1359
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,000
with that uh from working in the gdpr

1360
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,079
context

1361
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:52,960
so

1362
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,800
i i'd like to reiterate what my

1363
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,480
expertise about the dsa is fairly

1364
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,520
limited

1365
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,880
so i've done a bit of reading before

1366
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,280
this panel but it's definitely not on

1367
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,040
par with my uh crew speaker here but my

1368
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
impression is that

1369
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,400
um what the dsa is

1370
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,359
in terms of uh enforcement when it comes

1371
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,240
to the topic we researched at least so

1372
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,720
i'm talking at tech and um

1373
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
surveillance-based online advertising i

1374
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,359
feel like it's still missing out on a

1375
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,640
big

1376
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,520
statement should i say like what the

1377
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,800
some of the things we've observed is

1378
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,480
that there is a lack of

1379
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,720
agreement between the dpas on what is

1380
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,440
local or not lawful and what the dpr

1381
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,559
actually means and how it should be

1382
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,960
enforced and i don't think the dsa is

1383
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,799
necessarily addressing this in a better

1384
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:41,599
way

1385
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,480
um

1386
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,119
and so sure data sharing with academics

1387
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,839
uh uh being sort of

1388
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:52,799
um protected or or set up by such a text

1389
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,880
might be a good thing but we're still

1390
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,200
not addressing the core issue of online

1391
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,760
data collection and profiling and all of

1392
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
the the processing used to follow from

1393
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,720
this and i don't i like from my limited

1394
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,920
understanding i think this is still

1395
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,640
missing out and it's not going to be

1396
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,880
helpful for gdpr enforcement in the

1397
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,280
future

1398
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,118
thank you

1399
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,520
we are we are almost out of time already

1400
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,079
we have five minutes left so

1401
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,559
maybe i mean we're we're of course we're

1402
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,559
in the middle of this deal you know like

1403
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,160
we just had the european parliament

1404
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,760
plenary vote

1405
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
uh with some exciting uh improvements i

1406
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,839
think

1407
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:34,720
that

1408
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,520
we can be excited about um there's going

1409
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,960
to be dialogue

1410
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,079
um what is still possible and what what

1411
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,799
what are you aiming for in in that

1412
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,960
particular context maybe that is a nice

1413
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,680
question to to close with but it's still

1414
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,920
possible in the coming months

1415
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,599
in terms of improvements also in

1416
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,000
particular on these on these issues that

1417
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,040
we've been speaking about

1418
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,400
uh if i may if i may um

1419
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,440
start

1420
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,799
um

1421
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,799
of course if we are now discussing

1422
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,480
whether or not we like the commission

1423
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,680
and this role uh it's of um

1424
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,400
it's of scientific value but it we won't

1425
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
be able to change that anymore with

1426
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,440
prior looks we have the ep in the

1427
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
console mandate and the commission tax

1428
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,960
and our negotiating power will be

1429
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,359
between these three texts right so we

1430
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,359
will end up with the commission uh being

1431
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:28,400
in this

1432
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,559
in this role and i think um what's worth

1433
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,000
investing now is how we can um

1434
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,240
how we can make that a sound role how we

1435
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,000
can maybe still introduce some

1436
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,599
safeguards that odishka was talking

1437
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,559
about

1438
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,720
how we can further ensure independence

1439
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,000
and so on so there's uh between the text

1440
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,880
of course there's very limited uh room

1441
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,599
for introducing new ideas but

1442
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,520
i'm hopeful that we can

1443
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,359
work out in some of the recitals maybe

1444
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,680
some clarifications uh into what we

1445
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,559
actually

1446
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,720
expect from the from the commission and

1447
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,440
um one thing that i that i regret that

1448
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,599
it did not find um its way into the

1449
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,880
final texts

1450
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
was um that i would have really valued

1451
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,720
or we would have really valued a review

1452
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,960
class also in regards to the enforcement

1453
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,520
chapter because as everyone i think

1454
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,000
today rightly pointed out it is a huge

1455
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,680
challenge we shouldn't blindly follow uh

1456
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,520
our learnings from gdpr but we should

1457
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,280
also acknowledge them the challenge is

1458
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,240
to kind of uh kind of find our way

1459
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,920
through here and anticipate what's uh

1460
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,559
what's about to come so being able after

1461
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,799
a couple of years to sit down again and

1462
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,480
review whether the enforcing chapter

1463
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,000
that we the presidential and that we

1464
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,079
came up with makes sense whether it

1465
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,000
makes sense and how far it makes sense

1466
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,319
to give these powers to the commission

1467
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,559
if it's working out fine

1468
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,880
to see whether maybe this unit that will

1469
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,400
end up working on these things in the

1470
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,319
commission could be outsourced at a

1471
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,040
certain point in time in the future all

1472
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,119
of these are questions that um

1473
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,599
will be way harder to answer if uh if

1474
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:00,559
we're not

1475
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,640
able to properly review the text without

1476
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,119
opening up the entire uh the entire file

1477
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,400
again

1478
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,599
but

1479
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,520
thank you that uh that's that's

1480
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,160
insightful and and and seems uh those

1481
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,319
are seem to be very reasonable objective

1482
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,599
i i uh we have like two minutes left and

1483
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,839
uh but i want to give uh each of the

1484
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,880
speakers just a chance to say some final

1485
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,119
thing so maybe one two sentences each

1486
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,319
english please

1487
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,119
so very practically speaking with next

1488
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,119
for us is to sit down

1489
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,720
what we are actually already doing very

1490
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,319
closely compare european parliament

1491
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,559
position with the council position

1492
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,200
realistically as where we need to invest

1493
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,680
our powers continue promoting those

1494
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,440
safeguards i mentioned today in the

1495
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,839
context of the enforcement but also

1496
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,839
other priorities that we have

1497
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,160
and hoping that we will actually create

1498
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,040
a check and balance system a mechanism

1499
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,599
that where i will beat independence play

1500
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,599
significant role because without

1501
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,119
independence there will be no proper

1502
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,200
accountability in my view

1503
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,520
um and someone even mentioned article

1504
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,280
8.3 of the charter of the eu so um in

1505
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,160
the chat so uh all of them will be in

1506
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,599
hands up

1507
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,520
just looking forward to cooperate with

1508
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,960
the commission as well as with the

1509
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,440
european parliament on getting the best

1510
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,319
possible law on regulating platforms and

1511
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,160
especially protecting users and their

1512
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,520
empowerment

1513
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,200
at the end of this process

1514
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,960
thank you

1515
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,880
one sentence each elliot paul

1516
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,280
i like pogo i don't think i have

1517
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,559
anything valuable to add to his

1518
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,079
discussion but thank you for my panel

1519
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,720
if you want a strong enforcer

1520
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
i think it's good to leave enforcement

1521
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,240
power in the commission look at

1522
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240
competition look at infringements

1523
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,240
against member states

1524
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,359
anything else are schnapps

1525
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,040
also the commission is the most

1526
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,440
independent body it's a strong body

1527
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,680
which is not easily captured it's not a

1528
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,440
small you know regulator who

1529
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,040
so you know

1530
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,720
think about this

1531
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,079
