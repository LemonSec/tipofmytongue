business perspective

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
in this discussion

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
so just to

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
frame it very briefly before we dive in

83
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,040
and i'm going to make this a hopefully a

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
very dynamic discussion uh with the help

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,440
of everyone participating so i've

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
already shared with you a a pad where

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,159
their link is in the in the chat here

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,879
and you can also raise your hand if you

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,400
want to ask questions and i'll try to

91
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,799
take questions at least towards the end

92
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,480
but maybe also before uh if possible

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
so uh the discussion about

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
surveillance-based advertising has been

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,239
really heating up um the last few years

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
in europe and in the us and it's at the

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
core of the big tex business model to re

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
to and the entire ad tech industry um on

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
relying on extensive tracking and

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,519
profile profiling of individuals and

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
then micro target abs back at them based

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
on their behavioral history

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,239
relationships and supposed identity

104
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,959
um and in the last year uh civil society

105
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,920
and smes have mass mobilized in europe

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,000
and in the us against these this type of

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
surveillance and today we're going to

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
try to dig into why that is why is this

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,200
an important issue and what can we do

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
about it and hopefully when you leave

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
today

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040
you'll feel both motivated and you'll

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,760
feel inspired to do something concrete

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
to help reach this

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,560
goal

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,199
so i wanted to um

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
start with some open-ended questions to

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
all three panelists to get the

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
conversation going

120
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
and let's start with unico

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
um

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,400
and the question for all three of you is

123
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,440
why

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
is a ban on surveillance-based

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
advertising important why should we care

126
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,400
and why should we do something and why

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,120
should politicians act to regulate this

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
space better

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
thank you finn um and thank you to all

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
the organizations hosting

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
this panel that was uh thrown together

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
quite quickly after a very busy last

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,199
week uh week on on the surveillance

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,440
advertising front a great week

135
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
um so

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
surveillance advertising is really

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
important to address because it is the

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,600
core

139
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
of the business model that funds and

140
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,639
fuels social media companies especially

141
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
they have built their services as

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
ostensibly free

143
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
but the cost is really extracting

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
thousands and thousands of data points

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
on all of us whether or not you use

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
those social media platforms or not

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
they have a file on you

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,199
and they are able to sell that data

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,320
to the highest bidder in order to

150
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
serve you um ads that really follow you

151
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
around the internet um and and surveil

152
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,199
you

153
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,080
and

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,639
what this does is uh it really promotes

155
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
content that stokes engagement and what

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
stokes engagement

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
the most outrageous content and so the

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
surveillance advertising business really

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,160
funds discrimination division and

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
delusion and

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,919
uh that is you know we at

162
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
accountabletech believe that

163
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
banning surveillance advertising is

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,080
necessary in order to reclaim our

165
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,199
democracy um i think democracy both in

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,680
the united states and globally is at a

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
turning point and part of that the

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
reason we're at this point

169
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,960
is because of the role of online

170
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
communities social media companies and

171
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
big tech

172
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,919
that

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
is able to uh

174
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
use their their business model and uh

175
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
appeal to their shareholders above all

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,719
else um at the at the risk of democracy

177
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,680
thank you very much for that opening uh

178
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
remark and i don't want to ask you on

179
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,639
the the same question why is this

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,000
important from your perspective and

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,759
welcome john for uh for joining i know

182
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,120
diverse and technical problems you were

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,880
here early actually so

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,639
uh welcome and you'll get the question

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
lost then yeah

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
uh thank you finn i i think um i think

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
maybe let me add this in the european

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,080
context we often get the question i'm

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
sure in the u.s nicole you got the same

190
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,440
question sometimes but i think in in

191
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
europe it's you know it's easier to ask

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
this question because people can point

193
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
to gdpr so the question we get is

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
why do we need to ban on surveillance

195
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,400
advertising we've already got gdpr isn't

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,199
this supposed to protect our data in a

197
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
context such as online advertising and

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
in a way it is

199
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,319
um

200
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,479
and yet we've seen over and over again

201
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
since gdpr came into force that somehow

202
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
this wasn't enough now why isn't this

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
enough

204
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
um and i think you know you've got all

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
the consent framework that gdpr creates

206
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,080
where people shouldn't you know where

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,759
companies shouldn't be supposed to be

208
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,080
allowed to use personal data without

209
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
people's consent for the purpose of

210
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
targeting them with

211
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
advertising

212
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
and yet you know as well as gdpr works

213
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,560
in a lot of different data data

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
processing contexts

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,720
when it comes to online advertising

216
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,160
we've seen over and over again in the

217
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
past years that will consent framework

218
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
has failed people in practice and that

219
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
it doesn't provide the protections that

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
it was supposed to

221
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
uh provide and as a result um you know

222
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
after lots and lots of discussions we

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
had with some society academics uh even

224
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
industry people

225
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,919
we realized that there is

226
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
there is almost no way to fix this in

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
terms of regulation to make it work for

228
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
people and if that's the case well our

229
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
conclusion was the only way that we can

230
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
realistically achieve actual protection

231
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,120
for people is by banning the technology

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
altogether

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
and again for the purpose of showing um

234
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
online advertising

235
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
and i also want to remind very quickly

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
that when we say online advertising this

237
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
is not only shoe ads or car ads that you

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
get this is any message that anybody

239
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
with money in their pockets wants to

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
push onto your screen

241
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
it can be a political message can be an

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
opinion can be

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
can be lies can be anything and i think

244
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
this is why why this is so problematic

245
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,200
thank you for for for for that opening

246
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
jan i think you highlighted some also

247
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
some very important points and i'm

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
really glad to have with us a person

249
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
from the business uh or from the

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
industry side as well uh i introduced

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
you on when you were outside but i said

252
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
you've been working on on tech related

253
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
issues for for several decades and have

254
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,920
pioneered uh different technologies and

255
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,800
and

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
has had a an inside view to how it is to

257
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,279
operate on the internet from the early

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
days all until today and you've taken a

259
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
pretty strong stand and written a letter

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
together with other uh companies uh

261
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
urging both u.s policymakers and

262
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
european policymakers to ban

263
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,399
surveillance-based ads why is that

264
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
i think i mean like i said i've been on

265
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,480
the web since the very beginning i mean

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
basically since 1992

267
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
and i guess my thinking was always this

268
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
it's a beautiful thing the main thing

269
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
for us to do is to get everyone online

270
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
because equal access to information

271
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
moves the world forward and and the like

272
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
and that was really the feeling for a

273
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
long long long time and then it changed

274
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,880
about 10 years ago

275
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
and i really think what we are seeing is

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
a misuse of data and like i mean in some

277
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,360
ways i don't really understand how any

278
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,320
of what is happening can be legal at all

279
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
um for me when i was working at taylor

280
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,320
research and

281
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
we're learning about okay you can't

282
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
really share anything with anyone

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
how can it be that you can share it with

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
everyone

285
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,519
i mean is it basically you have data you

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,440
keep it safe or do you share it with

287
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
everyone and and

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
something has gone terribly terribly

289
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
wrong and i think what we've seen over

290
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
the last few years there's a lot of

291
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
consequences

292
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
with regards to

293
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,560
obviously misinformation and

294
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
ability to influence us based on who we

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
are but but also there's a lot of

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
businesses that are doing a lot worse

297
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,600
than they used to do in the past i mean

298
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,320
10 years ago most of the news sites

299
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
actually had free content there was no

300
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
pay walls at all really at that time

301
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
that's a very big change and i think a

302
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
lot of that has happened with regards to

303
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,560
the change in the systems now i would go

304
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
further than you guys when it comes to

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,440
the regulation because i really think we

306
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,760
are kind of enabling spyware and just

307
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
because they've been doing this for 10

308
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,120
years doesn't give them the right to

309
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
continue to do so i don't think any

310
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,839
company should be allowed to collect

311
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,240
information and profile their users i

312
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
mean i think it's outrageous and whether

313
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
you use it for advertisement or for

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
other purposes the problem is from a

315
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,079
security perspective it's a massive

316
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,040
problem

317
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,360
the information whatever everyone is

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,399
doing is potentially available either

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
through that is basically as as it is

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,279
today you can buy access to the audience

321
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
by buying racks to this information or

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
it could be leaked i mean basically

323
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
profiling of every individual in the

324
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
european union or the us is available as

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
something that you can hack one way or

326
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
another i mean i i really think this is

327
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
a massive security problem and one of

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
the concerns that i have

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
with going with a similar solution that

330
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
we had the gdpr

331
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,160
is that we are basically legalizing this

332
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,560
uh with gdpr when you're showing the

333
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,639
dialogue the dialogue is supposed to ask

334
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,839
for consent

335
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
the problem with that you see the

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
dialogue whether the consent is

337
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
inconsequential

338
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,600
or significant and no one reads the text

339
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
anyway so you the only thing you really

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
as a user see you see a dialogue saying

341
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,920
can i spy on you or can i collect your

342
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
information and either you have the view

343
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
okay i have to do this because that's

344
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
what i have to do

345
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
and you're more likely to say yes to the

346
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
bigger guys because you don't want to

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
have not access to your most your

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
services or your phones

349
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
and you might then be blocking some

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
smaller parties that really don't matter

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,839
in the big picture

352
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,680
uh or you're you're basically giving

353
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
kind of access to i mean you're giving

354
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
access to everyone or no one and and

355
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
that really isn't working so i think we

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
have a significant problem and i think

357
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,440
there's a risk that the solution

358
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
actually creates a a bigger problem

359
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,959
because i think some of the big guys

360
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
what they've been asking for is

361
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
regulation because if they can point at

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
regulation and they're staying inside

363
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
the regulation in some way then they're

364
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
kind of they've gotten an okay to

365
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
continue doing what they're doing which

366
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,720
is wrong it's it's spying on users

367
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
shouldn't be legal building profiles and

368
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,040
users shouldn't be legal

369
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,959
uh and and by the way you can provide

370
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
all these services that you like without

371
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
doing that it i mean

372
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,519
it's

373
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,760
they try to make straw arguments either

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,120
with regards to not being able to

375
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
provide the services

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
or they try to push some smaller

377
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,959
companies or otherwise

378
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
to to talk their messaging but the

379
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
reality they've pushed people into a box

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
they rip they've taken away what was a

381
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,320
working business model and replaced it

382
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,480
with another one and obviously if you

383
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,240
take away the new one you will have a

384
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
problem uh in for a little while while

385
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,720
you go back to

386
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,199
a more sane uh way of dealing with ads

387
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,480
on the internet

388
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
yeah thank you john that's a very very

389
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
strong message and i and i think we

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,519
should delve into that a little bit

391
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
later as well is what would the internet

392
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
look like if we if we managed to get

393
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
these bands through and possibly other

394
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,240
measures as well to sort of um reduce or

395
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
completely remove the surveillance um

396
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
but before we go there i'd like to ask

397
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,399
um jan and nicole just a question on on

398
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,839
there has been obviously now two

399
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
different policy processes going on um

400
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
one has been going on for a while in

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,040
europe uh out in the open but also in

402
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,199
the u.s uh accountable tech has been

403
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,800
pushing with a huge alliance of

404
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
organizations from all sorts all walks

405
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,880
of the different

406
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
civil society lives and really pushing

407
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
for um for uh legislation in this area

408
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,760
so nicole could you just briefly for the

409
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
audience who are not familiar with uh

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,079
the the re very recent developments in

411
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,639
the us both in with from congress but

412
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
also from a consultation from the ftc

413
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
which you have um opened up through your

414
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,959
organization just tell us briefly what

415
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
those initiatives are about and what

416
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,800
would sort of come from them

417
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,760
yeah

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,519
so uh last week on tuesday

419
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
legislation was introduced in the u.s

420
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
congress that

421
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
would ban surveillance advertising it is

422
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,000
literally called the banning

423
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
surveillance advertising act

424
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,800
um and it was put forth by

425
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
representative anna ashu who actually

426
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
represents silicon valley

427
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
um senator cory booker from new jersey

428
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,399
and and representative jan schakowsky

429
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,279
and what this does is lays out very

430
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
simply

431
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
a ban on surveillance advertising it

432
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,279
makes uh one or two exceptions for

433
00:15:59,279 --> 00:15:59,720
um

434
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,959
[Music]

435
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,639
geography and

436
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,440
uh

437
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,880
but otherwise

438
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
is an outright ban and and we were

439
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
extremely heartened to see this from you

440
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,720
know a representative whose

441
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
uh constituents include the big tech

442
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
companies who rely on this business

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
model and it's the first time that

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
legislation of its sort has been

445
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
introduced in the united states congress

446
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,720
um you all in the eu have been far ahead

447
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,839
of us

448
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,320
in terms of actual legislating around

449
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
this and uh we're trying to play catch

450
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,199
up a little bit here um and the band

451
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,440
surveillance advertising act is one part

452
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
of that the second that you also

453
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
mentioned finn is through the federal

454
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,639
trade commission or the ftc

455
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,160
um and

456
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
a lot of this is to do from from

457
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
president biden his administration has

458
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
really established that he

459
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
very clearly supports the reigning in of

460
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
big tech through um regulation of both

461
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,280
competition and content and to that end

462
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,079
he

463
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
has installed uh lena khan as chairwoman

464
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,679
of the federal trade commission and and

465
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,039
she is

466
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,520
um has really revitalized anti-trust law

467
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
in the united states and so under

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,359
under this new regime at the ftc

469
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
accountable tech submitted kind of a

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
novel petition in the fall of last year

471
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
asking the federal trade commission to

472
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,240
initiate what is called a rule making

473
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
process which is their

474
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,679
uh their their process of updating rules

475
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,200
and regulations

476
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
um to ban surveillance advertising and

477
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,039
right now that is

478
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,520
up for open comment and so

479
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,320
um anyone can submit a comment to the

480
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,559
federal trade commission um actually up

481
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,600
until tomorrow night at midnight uh with

482
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,160
their with their take on this and and

483
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
why they might support the ban of

484
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
surveillance advertising from their

485
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
unique perspective because there is a

486
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,960
lot of different reasons to come at this

487
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
um so those are the two big developments

488
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,640
that we're we've been a part of um over

489
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
the last few months and and we're

490
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
excited to see some developments on our

491
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
side of the pond

492
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
yeah and it was really encouraging to

493
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
see and i know you've been working very

494
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,280
hard in the background to achieve both

495
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,520
those two uh great developments have you

496
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,840
received any pushback uh industry push

497
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
back the political pushback on these

498
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
proposals i'm sure you have what what

499
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,840
are the what what sort of pushback do

500
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
you get

501
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
um yeah actually there was a report out

502
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,080
i think on friday last week that showed

503
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
that in the united states big tech broke

504
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,760
their own record uh for the amount of

505
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
money they have spent on lobbying

506
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,160
last year just seven companies spent 70

507
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
million dollars lobbying the united

508
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
states congress and that you know that

509
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
of course does not take into account

510
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
any number of front groups um these you

511
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,240
know so-called kind of impartial

512
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
advocacy organizations that they have

513
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,360
funded or um think tanks that they are

514
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
putting money behind to get studies out

515
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
that support their point of view

516
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,400
and so i think what you're seeing and

517
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
and yan i'm sure you can comment on this

518
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
from the european perspective is big

519
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
tech is scared they're

520
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
really quite nervous for the first time

521
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,440
that um not only regulators and

522
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,000
legislators but consumers might be

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,480
catching on to

524
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
the game they've been playing with all

525
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
of us and so

526
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
we're seeing quite a bit of pushback um

527
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
but in a way that's quite heartening to

528
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,679
know that we are really hitting

529
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
at the core of the problem here

530
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
yeah and i think that's a really good

531
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
point and i think the issue of consumers

532
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,400
or citizens is something we should also

533
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,080
do how can we get

534
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
uh people involved in this and i i

535
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,919
really think that we've seen it seems to

536
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,280
me at least that there's been a huge

537
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,039
shift here and i i would agree with you

538
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,240
that uh

539
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
the fact that they're spending so much

540
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,679
money on lobbying is a sign that uh this

541
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,080
has hit the nerve uh yeah just drawing

542
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
on that what um what's happening in

543
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
europe uh for those who are not too

544
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
familiar with the brussels uh bubble

545
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
um yeah so in europe big tech companies

546
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
have done similar things that i mean the

547
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
amount of resources they have thrown

548
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,320
into fighting the proposals that we've

549
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
been putting forward

550
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,520
on the european level it's just

551
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
mind-blowing and it actually makes me

552
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
quite happy to see

553
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,600
um that this is such you know as you say

554
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
yes has touched on the nerve and um

555
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,280
and

556
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
it's true that um

557
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
that we we have been slightly ahead in

558
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,600
europe with uh uh legislative reform but

559
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
now i'm worried that the us could catch

560
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,720
up because it's kind of you know who

561
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,320
knows what's going on you know how this

562
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
will end in the european union so what

563
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,320
we've had on the european level is and i

564
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,240
think most of have heard of this is the

565
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
digital services act and the digital

566
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
markets act um dsa and dma

567
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
both laws uh touch upon the use of data

568
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
of personal data for you know by these

569
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
big companies

570
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
and so when the dsa came out there was

571
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,480
nothing on uh banning surveillance

572
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,159
advertising in

573
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
in that in that law and uh when we

574
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
looked at this we thought you know why

575
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
you know why don't we use this

576
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
opportunity to push for something

577
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,559
stronger

578
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
and we if they already make a law for

579
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
online platforms um

580
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
you know more broadly defined then why

581
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
why don't we use this opportunity to to

582
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,600
go after the business model um and uh

583
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,840
and try to you know mitigate the harms

584
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
that we see are coming from from

585
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,360
surveillance advertising and that's what

586
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,039
what we did and we tried to get you know

587
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
members of the european parliament on

588
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
board um and uh

589
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
and and started talking about this and

590
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
over the course of a year one and a half

591
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,520
years

592
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,159
this has really uh caught fire and

593
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,440
started to be really interesting for

594
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,600
people and and that's how we ended up

595
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
now with um a

596
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,600
position from the european parliament

597
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,640
which

598
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
doesn't go all the way to a full band of

599
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,360
surveillance advertising unfortunately

600
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,960
because that was in the end the question

601
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,159
of majorities also which you need to um

602
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,120
to get in the parliament but it does at

603
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,280
least have a partial ban in it

604
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
what it does is that the provision says

605
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
you cannot use um particularly sensitive

606
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,559
types of personal data for the purpose

607
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
of targeting advertising so sensitive

608
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,559
types of data are already defined in the

609
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
gdpr so that makes it easy that's stuff

610
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
like health data

611
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
information about sexual preferences

612
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,600
religious or political opinions these

613
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,679
kind of things psychological profiles so

614
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
all of this stuff that's currently used

615
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
to target people with content

616
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
would in the future um not be possible

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,679
to use anymore um and again this is not

618
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,760
a full band um but i think it's you know

619
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,840
it's um goes further than what we had in

620
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
the past and it's beefed up even a

621
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
little bit more with a second provision

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
that goes after the use of dark patterns

623
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
and i know finn you at the end you see

624
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,919
you've worked a lot on dark patterns

625
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,000
and we've drawn a lot also from you know

626
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
have based our work on the research

627
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
you've been doing

628
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,320
and so there's a provision now that

629
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,960
would explicitly prohibit any use of

630
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
dark patterns

631
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
by these companies

632
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
and i think this would also kind of help

633
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,280
at least partially fix the problem that

634
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,559
we see with

635
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
with the gdpr's consent framework at the

636
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
moment so that is all of that is not

637
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
decided yet in a final vote we'll have

638
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,080
to see now that we convince all the 27

639
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,400
or at least as many as possible

640
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
of the 27 member states in the eu um to

641
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,279
make sure that this gets a majority but

642
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,480
i'm hopeful that in one form or another

643
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,080
these provisions will make it into the

644
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,559
final loan

645
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,919
thank you thank you so much and i want

646
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,279

but john i mean you work representing

654
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960

and yes as i mentioned you've been very

656
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
loud and you've been into here in this

657
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,600
panel i mean you're very very uh clear

658
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,039
in your messages

659
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,919
um

660
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,159
what would you say are good business

661
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,640
arguments as well for for i mean you

662
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
haven't teamed up with several other

663
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,320
companies uh you've now

664
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
not been speaking out at events you've

665
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,360
been meeting with policy makers when you

666
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
invited us etc

667
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,320
what are what are you telling

668
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,919
policymakers that the business what's

669
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
the business argument for for such a ban

670
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,039
well i think i mean

671
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,000
it's

672
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
partly it's a question of what do you

673
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
allow businesses to do

674
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,799
and is it fair that certain companies

675
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,200
can be basically allowed to spy on users

676
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
is it natural that that is something

677
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
that should be allowed to do i mean i

678
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,360
also think that the message that if you

679
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
look 10 years back

680
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
and you look at the history of the

681
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,520
internet

682
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,840
the internet was working just fine

683
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,480
without this stuff now these guys they

684
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,559
would like to tell you that the internet

685
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,360
was built on these technologies and

686
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
that's not true that is literally a lie

687
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
there were no working business models on

688
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,760
this until probably around 2010 i would

689
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
say that that kind of started to change

690
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
and i think also it's quite visible at

691
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
the time that there was i mean you had

692
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,520
as i said three newspapers and they like

693
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,039
that have had to change their business

694
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,120
model because with the change to

695
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,400
surveillance-based ads their revenues uh

696
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,799
would go down because i mean basically

697
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,960
it's a question of in the early days of

698
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
the internet you had a significant

699
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,760
difference in price based on location

700
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,080
right so if you're going to a quality

701
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
location you would have to pay quite a

702
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
lot for visibility there

703
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
but if you were uh kind of putting in uh

704
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,279
unknown location or the like you would

705
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,840
get a hundredth of the value

706
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,240
uh for the ads um

707
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,159
so the big change is because the ads

708
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,600
follow the person

709
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
you would get potentially much more paid

710
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,520
in a really bad location so the the

711
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
there's a change there in the dynamics

712
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,120
of things and i think that needs to be

713
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
taken into consideration but i think in

714
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
any case we have to look at what is this

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,240
doing to society whenever you do a

716
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,120
change

717
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
there's winners and losers and the fact

718
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,480
that certain companies have been allowed

719
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
to spy on their users and build profiles

720
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,960
that's given them

721
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,039
an income and it does create winners and

722
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
losers in the advertising model

723
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
system

724
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,520
i think we could easily go back to a

725
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
more of a location-based

726
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
kind of

727
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,360
contextual based advertisement model and

728
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,640
we would get

729
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,720
rid of a lot of these issues i really

730
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,039
think that asking users to make a

731
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,360
decision on whether to

732
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
allow spying on them or not is

733
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
unreasonable i also think that basically

734
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,640
having it unclear what you can collect

735
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,279
of information and the like is also a

736
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,880
problem you have to make it very very

737
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
clear where the line is and what you can

738
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
do with data and what you can't do with

739
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
data and i'm a little bit concerned that

740
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,400
what

741
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
these companies are trying to do is to

742
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,880
water out the argument so that you end

743
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,399
up with something that

744
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,640
kind of doesn't work and we've seen that

745
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
happen before i mean

746
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
we've taken the fight with companies

747
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,399
like like microsoft before to the eu i

748
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,120
think the eu has shown a willingness to

749
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
take on the fight which is

750
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
very admirable but at the same time

751
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
we've also seen that the guys are pretty

752
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,240
good at finding loopholes

753
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,480
and that's a problem now

754
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,720
i always have to ask these large

755
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
companies i mean

756
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,799
do they feel that this is okay the

757
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
employees at those companies can they

758
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
look themselves in the eyes and think

759
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
okay what i'm doing is okay the

760
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
algorithm that i make

761
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,240
actually divides people into camps is

762
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
that okay

763
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,840
i mean if i made an algorithm like that

764
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,080
i would throw it away and rewrite it or

765
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
something but

766
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,320
the part of the problem is again there's

767
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
a slippery slope there and you're

768
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,440
starting with the data that you're

769
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
allowing to be used in those algorithms

770
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,679
and i think if you take that data away

771
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,559
and you don't allow to use uh

772
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
kind of

773
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,279
personal information has been collected

774
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,799
or otherwise

775
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,039
then the algorithms will do much less

776
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,399
damage like the

777
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
kind of initial face of a lot of these

778
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,440
systems was basically okay you see what

779
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
your friends post

780
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,640
and you see it at the top and there

781
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
isn't any kind of

782
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,640
kind of manipulation of the content by

783
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,279
third parties or the algorithm

784
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,399
uh so

785
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
anyway i i really think we have to think

786
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
about kind of uh society in this as well

787
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,360
uh businesses uh are part of a society

788
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
and we should be doing things to help

789
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,360
society and not undermine our societies

790
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,919
thank you very much john for those uh

791
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
very strong words and i think coming

792
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,399
from a business man such as itself makes

793
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,520
them even

794
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,480
stronger i think at times because from

795
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
those of us from civil society we're

796
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,360
often uh

797
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
often attacked uh

798
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
for not having wanting to kill off the

799
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
internet or and wanting to take the toys

800
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
away from people

801
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,080
and i think what you're saying here is

802
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,399
that it's possible to to do business uh

803
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,159
and still respect the basic uh

804
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,919
fundamental rights which uh as a

805
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,320
moderator uh i should

806
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,080
post my own opinion but i i would

807
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
personally agree to that uh jan and

808
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
nicole do you want to comment to that uh

809
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,919
or just raise your hands if you want to

810
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,919
sort of get a word otherwise i have a

811
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,520
question so what can we i mean these

812
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,320
companies are global companies they have

813
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,559
international lobby operations they're

814
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,640
coordinated um

815
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
civil society groups tend to be local or

816
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,720
national and and rarely sort of global

817
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,279
so how can we learn from each other uh

818
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,919
how can we coordinate and how can we

819
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,679
achieve i think we already achieved

820
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,640
amazing results uh but the you know the

821
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,600
discussions are not over in europe uh uh

822
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
the the dsa the is going into

823
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,399
negotiation so-called trial logs on eu

824
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,960
speak and in the us this is a proposed

825
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,720
law so lots is left to be done uh what

826
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,480
can we learn from the process we've been

827
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,039
involved in um and how can we sort of

828
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,480
move this forward

829
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,440
who wants to go first

830
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,679
i can start um i think

831
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
the representation of of the four of us

832
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,880
on this call is a really good place

833
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,159
to begin

834
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,440
um and i've been really heartened by the

835
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,360
role of business in this in this fight

836
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
and especially smaller

837
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
smaller tech companies in the united

838
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
states

839
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
using their voice and speaking out

840
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,440
business owners and businesses tend to

841
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,480
have a bit of an outsize

842
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,640
influence in the united states i would

843
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
say especially when it comes to

844
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,840
legislating and so

845
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,320
uh those businesses using their power

846
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,799
behind this issue has been has been

847
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,919
heartening

848
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,440
um the other

849
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,360
piece i'd say is you know we and and

850
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,440
jan and and finn you've been a part of

851
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,399
this

852
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,279
effort um created a transatlantic

853
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
coalition to to call for a ban on

854
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,600
surveillance advertising and that was

855
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,880
really the first effort of its kind

856
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,720
and i like to think that that also um

857
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,960
was a bit of a warning shot to some of

858
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
these companies the fact that

859
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,279
we are you know using technology to

860
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,919
collaborate together and to share

861
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,159
information and to learn from one

862
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,519
another

863
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,440
in order to

864
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,320
push legislation across the finish line

865
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,840
hopefully um and what we as a community

866
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,399
have realized is and we see this with

867
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,840
gdpr

868
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
with all of its shortcomings uh i in the

869
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
united states

870
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,080
see those pop-ups uh asking me to accept

871
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,120
or reject cookies and gdpr is not the

872
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,320
law of the land in the united states and

873
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,399
that's because we know that when we push

874
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,159
tech companies to have to follow laws in

875
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,200
specific jurisdictions it is often to

876
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
their advantage to make that change

877
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,399
globally and so pushing for change in

878
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,720
the eu um interesting work that has

879
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,799
happened in australia over the past few

880
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,640
years and the work we're doing in the

881
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,600
united states it's really all connected

882
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,159
um and all of us working together has

883
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,600
helped advance

884
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
i think this this issue in the past year

885
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,559
probably more than any of us could have

886
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,279
ever expected

887
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,600
jan or john do you want to comment

888
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,000
i can maybe um quickly stick on that and

889
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,960
say like

890
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
the when we spoke to european

891
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,360
policymakers um we had the impression

892
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,159
that they were they were very closely

893
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,320
looking at what the us was doing and the

894
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,559
the stronger and the louder the debate

895
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,399
in the u.s was around surveillance

896
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,960
advertising the more that was also heard

897
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,640
in europe and people were like paying

898
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,720
attention saying hey wait you know isn't

899
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,120
europe supposed to be the frontrunner in

900
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240
you know this kind of question um and uh

901
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,440
and i think that that was really

902
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,480
incredibly useful um maybe let me just

903
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,519
also um go one step back to something

904
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,880
john said about how um you know how how

905
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
people working for these companies can

906
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,399
you know how can they look in their in

907
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,000
the mirror in the mornings

908
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
i don't have a clear answer for that but

909
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,679
just to give you an example about the

910
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,320
level of

911
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,279
dare i say evilness that that this kind

912
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,080
of work sometimes reaches its mind it's

913
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,679
mind-blowing like

914
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,120
the the types of the types of

915
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,440
formulations we need to put into the law

916
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,519
here in order to prevent these companies

917
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,679
from circumventing it is

918
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,880
stuff like

919
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,919
uh refusing connect consent shall not be

920
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,399
more difficult than giving consent

921
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,520
right something so obviously

922
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,719
um decent that you would think anybody

923
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
who designs an online interface would do

924
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,159
in any case um and no this this is not

925
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,159
the case you you literally need to write

926
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,960
it into the law to make people um

927
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,480
respect it

928
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,560
um since i've got the mic i just want to

929
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,079
go back to the question that was posted

930
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,520
in the chat um to what extent the the

931
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,000
kind of the limited ban on targeting

932
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
based on sensitive data can be effective

933
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,960
um i think that's a really good question

934
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,879
and i can only partly answer it i think

935
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,119
party will just have to see um and it

936
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,440
will depend on the how strong the

937
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,239
enforcement of the dsa rules will be in

938
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,119
europe so how strong the regulators will

939
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
actually go after those companies um but

940
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,119
i

941
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,440
so the wording of the of the provision

942
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
that was proposed in the in the

943
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,839
parliament position is that targeting or

944
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,880
amplification techniques that process

945
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
reveal or infer

946
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,520
this kind of sensitive personal data is

947
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,720
prohibited

948
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,079
and so i i'm quite hopeful that not

949
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,320
since that doesn't only say process but

950
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
it also says reveal or infer

951
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
that some of these kind of

952
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,920
techniques that were used to you know to

953
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,800
guess

954
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
people

955
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
based on information or you know to kind

956
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,400
of you know extend profiles because you

957
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,720
know how patterns are uh if you have a

958
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,240
large amount of personal data i think

959
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,480
that may you know may be more easy to

960
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,720
restrict with such a formulation as

961
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,960
compared to the traditional wording

962
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,040
collection and processing that we know

963
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
from gdpr

964
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,279
leon do you want to comment

965
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,839
of course

966
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,160
i really think and i mean the the really

967
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,119
good news is the us is on the ball again

968
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
uh because i mean that's been part of

969
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
the problem dealing with this in europe

970
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,960
by itself is a little bit more

971
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
complicated i think there's always this

972
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
concern on the european side

973
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,119
are we doing something that's kind of

974
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,960
hurting our businesses or are we

975
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,440
creating some kind of situation and and

976
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
we've seen that before with companies

977
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
like microsoft and the like they'll do a

978
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,040
twist which

979
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,960
kind of makes the eu look bad or

980
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,240
something so you have to be wary of that

981
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,920
now i think the situation is now a

982
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
little bit turned on his head

983
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,800
now does the eu want to put together a a

984
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
a a kind of a proposal

985
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,560
that doesn't go as far as the americans

986
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,320
come on guys you don't want to be in

987
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
that situation either you have to kind

988
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
of talk together and come up with a

989
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,320
proposal that goes all the way and i

990
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
think in i would go further than both

991
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,200
proposals as i said before we need a

992
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,599
solution that basically makes this uh

993
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,440
kind of impossible to do anymore what

994
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
they're doing and i think in a way

995
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
yes making it harder is a good thing but

996
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,640
i think the damage that we are seeing is

997
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,720
so significant that we need to to to

998
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,480
kind of take this all the way and i

999
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,960
think again i mean referring to the

1000
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,480
people working at these companies i

1001
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
think there's a lot of really good

1002
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,440
people and i think a lot of them are

1003
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
telling themselves well everyone else is

1004
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
doing this so i guess it's something

1005
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,040
that we have to live with but at the

1006
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
same time every now and then i've seen

1007
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,000
people kind of take a stand and say okay

1008
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,520
this i don't want to be part of this

1009
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,640
anymore i don't want to be i want i've

1010
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
a lot of these people they're wanting to

1011
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,599
to build a a positive world and they

1012
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,520
want to be contributing to a positive

1013
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,400
world

1014
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,240
and now they're building technologies

1015
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,640
which is kind of making the world worse

1016
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,560
and i don't think that's what these

1017
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,240
people have signed up for and and

1018
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
hopefully they will they will start to

1019
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,839
to make their voices heard because their

1020
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,200
reality is

1021
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,119
in in places like silicon valley there's

1022
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,440
a lot of uh strong-willed people that if

1023
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
their voices

1024
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,720
if if if they

1025
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
tell the truth and go out and and say

1026
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,200
what's happening and and they

1027
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,440
push their co-workers and they're like

1028
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,839
as a team i i think you can see things

1029
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,880
happen

1030
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
i think it it's time to change these

1031
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,680
large companies they can survive with a

1032
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,599
change like this now they are concerned

1033
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,599
about their revenues they're concerned

1034
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,079
about the might and and the the place

1035
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,400
that they manage to build up

1036
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,720
all of them are playing monopoly uh they

1037
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
want to kind of defend their turf and

1038
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,359
and the like but the reality is the

1039
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,520
damage that they're doing is this is not

1040
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,440
just about them becoming monopolies

1041
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,280
which is bad enough and a separate issue

1042
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
to discuss but it's something where

1043
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
they're actually damaging the world that

1044
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,119
we live in and and i don't think any of

1045
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,280
those guys would like to have their that

1046
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,079
on their resume so it's time to to stand

1047
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,400
up and do the right thing

1048
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,920
thank you john thank you thank you again

1049
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,359
for um

1050
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,440
very strong words and and you mentioned

1051
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,359
earlier that the issue of security and

1052
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,359
it brings to mind that you know i think

1053
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,320
one of the things that might have

1054
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
changed and you can correct me all of

1055
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,079
you if i'm wrong is that we're suddenly

1056
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,640
seeing that this has a much wider impact

1057
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,599
on society than in the in before where

1058
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
you know our counter argument often but

1059
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,839
i like seeing ads for shoes and now we

1060
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,480
know that it's it has a much bigger

1061
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,800
impact on society and individuals than

1062
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,119
what we before believed i remember last

1063
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,560
year i believe there was a report from

1064
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,520
the nate from nato saying that these um

1065
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
this technology was also a national

1066
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,359
security risk because you could single

1067
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,880
out um

1068
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,800
people working in security services or

1069
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,599
you can use the tools for influence

1070
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
operations in elections etc and i think

1071
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,680
we have multiple evidences now that that

1072
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
has happened and it's happening today

1073
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,079
and i imagine that you know there's an

1074
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,640
opportunity now to continue building um

1075
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
new alliances and having you here today

1076
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,119
john is an example of that uh nicole and

1077
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,599
jan has both led large-scale alliances

1078
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,880
yan with the track and free ads

1079
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,240
coalition and nicole in in the u.s with

1080
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,280
her coalition there um what other

1081
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,040
movements do you see need to come

1082
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,359
together now and i think to to sort of

1083
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,960
make this voice heard to bring this

1084
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
issue out outside the tech bubble i

1085
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,400
already think it is outside the tech

1086
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
bubble but how can we

1087
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,240
uh you know further strengthen the

1088
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,800
arguments to make both people and policy

1089
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,200
makers understand why this is an

1090
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,960
important issue to deal with

1091
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
who wants to go first i think young

1092
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,480
raise this hand do you want to go first

1093
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,560
or anyone else

1094
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
sure i just don't want to monopolize the

1095
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,839
space if anyone else wants to come first

1096
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,440
otherwise i just want to say your point

1097
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,200
is really it's really spot-on i mean the

1098
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,000
freaking nsa and cia

1099
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
have reportedly

1100
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,520
used reportedly advert like ad blockers

1101
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
um to protect the security of their

1102
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,599
networks it is an absolute security risk

1103
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,319
um also because advertising is often you

1104
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,880
know loaded from untrusted third parties

1105
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
into your browser and and obviously that

1106
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,640
creates a big risk for all kinds of

1107
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,319
hacking especially if you're high high

1108
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,680
volume target

1109
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,720
um in terms of alliances what what is

1110
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,640
the most surprising thing for me in all

1111
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,640
of this is that until today

1112
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,720
most of the large publishing houses at

1113
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,319
least in europe but i guess in the u.s

1114
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,200
as well

1115
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,240
have

1116
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
um

1117
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,560
have

1118
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,200
sided with big tech in favor of

1119
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,240
surveillance advertising even though all

1120
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,079
of the research that i have seen at

1121
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
least points to them actually being

1122
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,280
severely hurt by the current advertising

1123
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
ecosystem they're losing for the past 10

1124
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,040
years they've been losing uh

1125
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,160
advertising revenue every year um and

1126
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,000
they're losing more or more of that to

1127
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,520
to the big tech companies to ad tech

1128
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,800
companies

1129
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,560
and yet they continue to defend the

1130
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,119
system as if it was vital for their

1131
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,680
survival yet they have lived very well

1132
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
on advertising long before google and

1133
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,680
facebook were around um and it's just

1134
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,839
beyond me why

1135
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,319
if that is just a lack of vision or a

1136
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,520
lack of foresight or if they have

1137
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,040
or if the if the surveillance

1138
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,119
advertising system has been around for

1139
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,400
long enough so that all of their

1140
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,480
marketing people maybe have you know

1141
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,079
already grown up in this system they

1142
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,400
can't even imagine anything else anymore

1143
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,480
um it's quite sad for me to see we've

1144
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,000
tried actively to reach out to

1145
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,200
publishers

1146
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,160
and individual newspapers as well to try

1147
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,800
to see how you know how if how they

1148
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
would imagine an alternative online

1149
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,760
advertising ecosystem but the results of

1150
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,079
those conversations were from our point

1151
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,400
of view rather disappointing um i'd be

1152
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,000
very curious also to hear more from from

1153
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,520
unicode what your experiences are in the

1154
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,280
us now

1155
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
john i'm glad you brought that up um the

1156
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,960
role of advertisers in this

1157
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,800
in surveillance advertising is something

1158
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
we haven't touched on really quite yet

1159
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,560
and

1160
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,359
um you know between google facebook and

1161
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,160
amazon those three companies own about

1162
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,400
90 or more than 90

1163
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,960
of the digital ad market

1164
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,319
not only that there have been

1165
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
a couple weeks ago some

1166
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,440
uh

1167
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
some documents were released as a part

1168
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,000
of a legal suit in the united states

1169
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,520
that shows

1170
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,680
google and facebook at their highest

1171
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,240
levels at the ceo levels have

1172
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,359
essentially colluded to price fix

1173
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,760
on on ad auctions

1174
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,359
and uh

1175
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,599
there's also a number of studies that

1176
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,040
demonstrate

1177
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,119
on a dollar of advertising digital

1178
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,359
advertising you know you see less than

1179
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,480
50 of that maybe even in less than that

1180
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
actually goes towards the advertising

1181
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,599
and so there's almost this cult of

1182
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,440
silence that

1183
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,480
exists

1184
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,000
in the ad

1185
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
advertiser business and the marketers

1186
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
business and

1187
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,040
um it makes me

1188
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,920
wonder

1189
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
you know if there's kind of an unspoken

1190
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
agreement that we're not going to speak

1191
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,079
out nobody's going to rock the current

1192
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,119
system

1193
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,319
but

1194
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,319
i have to imagine that there are

1195
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,920
shareholders

1196
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,720
um and board members of some of these

1197
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,040
companies that should be asking if

1198
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,760
you're spending millions or billions of

1199
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
dollars every year

1200
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,079
on digital advertising you really do

1201
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,079
need to ask yourself where is this money

1202
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,200
going

1203
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,119
is it actually benefiting our bottom

1204
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,400
line

1205
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,640
and how are we contributing really to

1206
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,040
the downfall of democracy through the

1207
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,040
surveillance ad infrastructure

1208
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,599
john do you want to add to that

1209
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,040
yeah

1210
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,560
yeah there's there's actually a couple

1211
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,319
of points that i wanted to make and and

1212
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,480
one of them is is about actually data

1213
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,599
collection

1214
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,839
and and security we were into this a

1215
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,119
little bit and i wanted to make a

1216
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,800
comment there and one of the concerns

1217
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,640
that i have personally

1218
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,079
uh is

1219
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,319
the fact that our profiles are being

1220
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,520
collected and you should be able to

1221
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,359
download them which is actually an

1222
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,800
interesting thing because that's been a

1223
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,400
request in some ways you should be able

1224
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,720
to download your data the problem with

1225
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,079
that now

1226
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,880
you may remember that we've had massive

1227
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,000
security breaches right like the yahoo

1228
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
one where kind of 500 million accounts

1229
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,280
got compromised now think about 500

1230
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
million accounts or a billion or two

1231
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,520
billion accounts with the level of data

1232
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,440
that is being collected by a facebook

1233
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,880
and a google

1234
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
uh actually getting into the hands of

1235
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,400
someone

1236
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
basically everything that you like on

1237
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
facebook what you're reading how long

1238
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,640
you watch videos

1239
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,440
uh

1240
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,839
i mean the amount of details to this and

1241
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,079
an analytics of where are you in the

1242
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
political uh square

1243
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,839
uh what are your sexual preferences and

1244
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,400
the like i mean even

1245
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,000
which is kind of things that they are

1246
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,280
they're kind of in

1247
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,839
inferring from this and i really think

1248
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,800
that that data is is it's dangerous and

1249
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,359
and i mean it shouldn't be kept uh

1250
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,760
and and it is it's an example of

1251
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,280
something that is is

1252
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,480
it's really serious and and it's part of

1253
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
the security concept that okay you can

1254
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,359
hack data that's one thing and then the

1255
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,960
other thing is you can buy access to

1256
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,000
people which is another and i i really

1257
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,760
think that that's something that we need

1258
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,359
to look into and

1259
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,880
now i i think it's good that we're

1260
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,520
collecting notes and and again i think

1261
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,040
there's a

1262
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
with a lot of this

1263
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,560
and i think maybe the reason why

1264
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,400
sometimes it's difficult for people to

1265
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,480
make the right decisions on this is not

1266
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,079
necessarily understanding the

1267
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,040
consequences of the actions and and when

1268
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
companies like uh

1269
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,720
that are like you say that are losing

1270
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,040
their revenues whether it's publishers

1271
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,319
or otherwise

1272
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,800
they have a model that they have today

1273
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,640
taking that away they're

1274
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,720
afraid they've been told okay now that

1275
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,160
would mean that the advertisement

1276
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,359
wouldn't work

1277
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,920
now it used to work better

1278
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,720
but for them to kind of realize that i

1279
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,800
mean that's a risky situation taking

1280
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,359
away what you have today

1281
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,560
which is

1282
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
i mean you have something in the hand

1283
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
and and the like so

1284
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,920
i i think that's one of the

1285
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,680
complications but i think a lot of them

1286
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,240
they're not liking that their

1287
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,079
revenues are basically being stolen

1288
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,720
because what's really happening is that

1289
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,280
content that they write or some maybe

1290
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,680
maybe copied and then utilized in all

1291
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,000
the situations or rewritten or just

1292
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
stories that are made up which are then

1293
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
going into people's feeds and are

1294
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,680
stealing the traffic away from those uh

1295
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,960
those services i mean that's part of

1296
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,440
the the equation as well but this is

1297
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,680
a lot of this is is a little bit

1298
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,359
complicated but the simple thing is

1299
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,720
basically

1300
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,559
if we were to go back

1301
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,040
10 years now and use the models that we

1302
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,160
had then

1303
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
then the world would be better

1304
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,480
and a lot of these companies that are

1305
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,319
now struggling the publishers which i

1306
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,079
think is really important that they have

1307
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,800
the funding to do what they need

1308
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,000
uh for free press and the like

1309
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
uh

1310
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,040
we need to get back to a situation where

1311
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,920
they can sustainably make revenues and

1312
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,079
and without having to go be fine behind

1313
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,240
pay walls because the reality is when

1314
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,280
quality content goes behind payroll and

1315
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,839
low quality content at times is free

1316
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,680
then you get a worse situation with

1317
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,119
regards to information and i think

1318
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,200
that's also part of the situation that

1319
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,280
we are actually seeing today

1320
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,880
thank you so you don't believe in the

1321
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,400
argument that if we

1322
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,319
people like us get it our way and get a

1323
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,920
ban on surveillance advertising

1324
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,680
consumers will have to pay for being on

1325
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,800
the internet

1326
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,319
no no no i mean

1327
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:31,599
why would they have to do they didn't

1328
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,200
have to do that in the beginning there

1329
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,040
was plenty of these companies that were

1330
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,000
doing quite a lot better at that time i

1331
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,920
think we were seeing at the time some of

1332
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,079
these companies making tremendous

1333
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,400
revenue growth as they moved over to the

1334
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,880
digital space i mean in norway you can

1335
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,040
look at shipstead as an example that

1336
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,400
actually in the beginning they were

1337
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,559
always losing money but then gradually

1338
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,200
as they moved their uh paper content

1339
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,960
over to the digital space i think they

1340
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,400
did quite well

1341
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,520
uh

1342
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,599
as an example of that and obviously

1343
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,200
there's always winners and losers when

1344
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,839
you have system change but

1345
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,559
the the reality it is

1346
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,040
was possible to do quite well with

1347
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,200
publishing content on the internet and

1348
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,920
and i think we need to get back to that

1349
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,160
yeah thank you so much and jan i see you

1350
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,440
raise your hand and i'll give you also

1351
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,599
the floor to nicole just um just the two

1352
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,400
questions um that i received here if i

1353
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,599
can find them

1354
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
what are the similarities in the framing

1355
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,599
in the u.s debate and in the eu debate

1356
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,880
as you see it and what are the

1357
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,160
differences

1358
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
um see i can find the other question i

1359
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,520
can't find it right now but we can start

1360
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,280
with that but also make your own points

1361
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,720
as well

1362
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,760
[Music]

1363
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
i just wanted to add on top what john

1364
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,920
just said and also to be fair to some of

1365
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,520
the publishers some of the publishers

1366
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,119
are actually quite progressive it's not

1367
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,280
like they're all the same um so you have

1368
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,599
newspapers such as uh target titling in

1369
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,079
germany or um

1370
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,920
the markup in the us

1371
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,160
uh or tech dirt which is a smaller tech

1372
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,559
blog um who who decided to either do not

1373
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,319
only advertising at all or at least they

1374
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,760
don't use tracking apps like

1375
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,760
surveillance advertising um they would

1376
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,440
just use context-based advertising i

1377
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,119
guess there are others out there as well

1378
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,040
um who do this and i think um this is an

1379
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,720
encouraging sign so it appears that this

1380
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
works as well let me call speak to the

1381
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,440
differences or or kind of um and in

1382
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,280
terms of narrative in the u or what you

1383
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,319
said in the eu and the us

1384
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,680
that's a really good question and i

1385
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,280
don't know that i can speak to it fully

1386
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,160
but

1387
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,200
um

1388
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,319
i think something that we've seen

1389
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,119
uh

1390
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,319
in the u.s context is

1391
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,680
there is a continued need to educate

1392
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,119
consumers

1393
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,920
around the harms of surveillance

1394
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
advertising and also the the

1395
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,119
monopolization of the digital market and

1396
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,200
and the tech market and social media

1397
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
companies especially

1398
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,000
um

1399
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,920
we uh

1400
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,440
you know we have a lot of issues right

1401
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,520
now in the united states um and

1402
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,960
helping

1403
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,079
consumers and citizens understand that

1404
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,599
reforming

1405
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,079
um our digital democracy would go quite

1406
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,119
a long ways towards reforming democracy

1407
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,319
writ large is is something that um i

1408
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,720
think we're still working on and still

1409
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,960
trying to crack that nut and you know

1410
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,280
part of this also comes from the

1411
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,720
administration

1412
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
um president biden has been really

1413
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,720
outspoken about his belief

1414
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,760
in

1415
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,200
reigning in big tech and putting some

1416
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,599
some common sense limits on these

1417
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,720
companies

1418
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,359
um and yet we'd like to see him

1419
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,160
take

1420
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,720
a stronger stance

1421
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,119
on the work that's being done in the eu

1422
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,520
because in a lot of ways the progress

1423
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,000
that's been made on the dsa and the dma

1424
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,720
but

1425
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,200
the dsa in this context will really

1426
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,319
achieve

1427
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,599
his vision for global democracy and and

1428
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,480
reigniting global democracy but to date

1429
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,720
his administration has been quiet on

1430
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,760
that front and uh it is an opportunity

1431
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,920
for him to take a leadership role and

1432
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,960
and i think unite um the vision that he

1433
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,599
has with uh what is happening in in the

1434
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,280
european parliament right now

1435
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,359
thank you i i i'm encouraged to hear

1436
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,200
that you know also then

1437
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,160
the

1438
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
the the what happens on one side of the

1439
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,760
pond inspires what happens on the other

1440
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,200
side of the position

1441
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,559
i can i can remember we're working in

1442
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,240
terms of transatlantic consumer dialogue

1443
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,280
this is one of the things we've been

1444
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,839
doing is to bring u.s groups to europe

1445
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,119
to talk to members of european

1446
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,800
parliament and then we're invited back

1447
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,559
to speak to members of congress about

1448
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,920
how we're doing things in europe so i

1449
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,960
think having also more um cooperation

1450
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,920
this way and also globally for sure

1451
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,520
on these issues is really important to

1452
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,200
achieve change and i'm going to read out

1453
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,440
a question here and it starts by sorry

1454
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,359
so it's always good sorry for bringing

1455
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,280
up the n-word but what about the

1456
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,599
metaverse what challenge is for tracking

1457
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,400
ads uh slash regulation question mark

1458
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,040
who wants who feels called to us

1459
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,640
i guess it's a general question about

1460
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,520
you know

1461
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,119
going forward technology is going to be

1462
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,559
more immersive it's going to be close to

1463
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,599
a body um vr

1464
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,280
fashion times revealed this week but the

1465
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,200
patterns from facebook they can track

1466
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
your eyes and basically your eyes will

1467
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,599
reveal your emotions right

1468
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,280
you can't hide your eyes when you're

1469
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,559
looking at things so

1470
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,599
yeah the future

1471
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,520
yeah i mean there's the future and then

1472
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,119
there is uh what we have in reality uh

1473
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,640
and i'd like to start with actually

1474
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,559
reality and part of the issue there is

1475
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,720
that you're now having companies uh

1476
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,400
there's a little startup in norway as an

1477
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,720
example of that that is collecting real

1478
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,800
world information and combining that

1479
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
with the online information

1480
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,160
they were solving

1481
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,480
more or less writing from reading from

1482
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,880
what they wrote on their site they're

1483
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,800
solving the problem that you don't have

1484
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,720
the level of information from the real

1485
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,839
world that you have in the online world

1486
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,680
so there's multiple ways to solve that

1487
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,280
particular problem

1488
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,200
and one of that in their case is using

1489
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,040
bluetooth technology to be able to

1490
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,520
follow you inside buildings and see

1491
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,680
potentially what you're looking at then

1492
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,359
i mean you combine that with your credit

1493
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,520
card information and the like so you're

1494
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,920
able to follow a person not only what

1495
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,760
they're doing on the online world where

1496
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,680
you're kind of tracking everything but

1497
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,440
you can then actually see that a person

1498
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,280
goes into a store looks at a certain

1499
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,480
dress

1500
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,040
and then ends up buying it in the store

1501
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,280
those kind of information is obviously

1502
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,119
scary and if you take that potential

1503
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,680
into the metaverse a company that is so

1504
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,319
much collecting everything that we do we

1505
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,599
want them to be in our virtual world as

1506
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,920
well kind of where we are kind of

1507
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,839
engaging with our friends and and the

1508
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,440
like and collecting information uh

1509
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,319
that's that's not good uh now obviously

1510
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:56,400
vr is not new and i mean we can be

1511
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
excited about the potential of the

1512
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,680
technology and there's a lot of cool

1513
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
things to be said about this but the

1514
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,520
reality certain companies should not

1515
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,280
really be allowed to deal with this at

1516
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,119
all because this should be a space where

1517
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,359
you can do things without your every

1518
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,960
move being tracked

1519
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,520
and again both in the real world and the

1520
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,000
virtual world please don't

1521
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,319
don't collect our information don't spy

1522
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,640
on us don't inspire us online don't spy

1523
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,720
on us on vr and don't spy on us in the

1524
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,240
real world it's just wrong

1525
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,880
thank you john and we're gonna very soon

1526
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,400
start con start asking for your

1527
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,319
concluding remarks but let me call

1528
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:33,520
briefly and then i'll ask you a

1529
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,119
follow-up last question

1530
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,040
or um just to add on on that last point

1531
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,880
i think

1532
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,599
all of us agree that the internet has

1533
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,799
done a lot of good and we are pro

1534
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,599
internet on this panel which by the way

1535
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
is something that big tech likes to

1536
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,359
paint civil society groups and

1537
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,000
non-profit groups as completely against

1538
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,359
technology um and if if the pandemic has

1539
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:02,240
taught us anything it's that technology

1540
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,799
is capable of of bringing people

1541
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,440
together in real genuine ways

1542
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,760
um that being said we're in this

1543
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,960
position

1544
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,079
right now

1545
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,000
because big tech

1546
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,960
has designed all of their products

1547
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,480
around growth

1548
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,400
not around people

1549
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,440
and uh you know if we're going to look

1550
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,280
at the metaverse and

1551
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,720
first of all the metaverse sounds like

1552
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,119
my idea of hell um

1553
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,799
if you've read there's like stories of

1554
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,000
harassment in the metaverse uh

1555
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
it just it sounds like all of the worst

1556
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,040
qualities of the real world put online

1557
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,319
um but again i think the metaverse is

1558
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,160
being designed with a profit orientation

1559
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,559
and we're going to end up with some of

1560
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,559
the same problems

1561
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,160
um in that iteration of the internet if

1562
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,520
uh if we allow companies to design the

1563
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,400
framework

1564
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,400
and there is no um

1565
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,880
regulations or or framework put into

1566
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,000
place by governments by civil society by

1567
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,119
people

1568
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,319
uh you know people should be asked for

1569
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,280
their opinion and how the online society

1570
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,920
and our digital democracy works

1571
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,160
yeah democratic governance and and the

1572
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,319
participation and on that note i want to

1573
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,920
ask all three of you uh a question um so

1574
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
we have had a fantastic event today

1575
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,880
there are lots of really uh

1576
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,119
interested people watching here now um

1577
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,079
and so what can we what happens now

1578
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:34,960
uh

1579
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,680
both very briefly from all three of you

1580
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,200
what can we do

1581
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,760
as organizations what do we need to do

1582
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,720
in our member states in our countries

1583
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,040
and what can we do as individuals

1584
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,000
um

1585
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,520
something along those lines who wants to

1586
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,680
go first

1587
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
i can start concluding remarks what can

1588
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,559
we do first thing don't use big tech

1589
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,799
don't use companies products if they're

1590
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,640
able to spy on you

1591
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,839
i think that's a really kind of

1592
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,839
straightforward thing and the second um

1593
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,839
the second is if you do have time if

1594
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,839
you're based in europe i guess in the us

1595
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,520
it's the same thing write to your

1596
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,680
elected representatives write to your

1597
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,359
members of parliament of the european

1598
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,599
parliament whoever you can find an email

1599
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,839
address for tell them that you hate

1600
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,839
being spied on and and that regulation

1601
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,720
needs to solve this

1602
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,598
thank you

1603
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,640
yeah so on my side i really would like

1604
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,599
to kind of reiterate the importance of

1605
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,160
going far enough with the proposals that

1606
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,839
if you have on the table

1607
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,240
make sure that the proposals actually

1608
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,079
solve the problem

1609
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,480
halfway if you go halfway and it doesn't

1610
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,240
solve the problem it may actually make

1611
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,720
the world a problem bigger make sure you

1612
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,280
go far enough and because it's it's

1613
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,599
easier to go the other way afterwards

1614
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,599
maybe saying okay we can we can we can

1615
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,680
lessen the screw a little bit here or

1616
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,480
there kind of with regards to

1617
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,480
with

1618
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,400
what you're able to do or not able to do

1619
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,960
but i think it's really difficult if you

1620
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,960
go there and you you put out a solution

1621
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,040
that doesn't solve the problem

1622
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,400
then we we're nowhere so we have to make

1623
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,000
sure that the solutions that are

1624
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,559
provided that they go far enough i think

1625
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,640
all of you that uh have an opinion on

1626
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,240
this make your worst

1627
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,920
make it hurt

1628
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,400
tell people what to kind of

1629
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,640
like i said write write to the people

1630
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,240
that have the power

1631
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,240
and also if you're inside those tech

1632
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,880
companies that are doing bad things make

1633
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,160
sure to

1634
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,319
have your voice heard as well a number

1635
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,480
of you have done that and i think it's

1636
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,720
really valuable when you when you do

1637
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,799
that and i think it's important that we

1638
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,559
all i mean

1639
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,880
we that work with technology the reason

1640
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,559
why we are doing this is because we want

1641
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,559
to make the world better for me

1642
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,359
personally on the internet giving people

1643
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,599
access to the internet and the wealth of

1644
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,440
information that's there it's a

1645
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,040
beautiful thing

1646
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,640
i don't want to see it destroyed and i

1647
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,440
know a lot of you agree with me we we

1648
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,359
want to to do the right thing we want to

1649
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,119
make the world better so let's do

1650
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,359
everything we can to contribute to a

1651
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,799
better world

1652
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,720
and move technology forward at the same

1653
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,839
time

1654
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,799
thank you so much now i'll be quick uh

1655
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,640
we're at time here i agree with

1656
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,480
everything that has been said

1657
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,880
so uh just to add to it

1658
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,520
talk to your friends and family about

1659
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,480
these issues you're here because you

1660
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,640
understand where you want to understand

1661
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,200
these issues more

1662
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,280
most of the world does not have the

1663
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,000
level of understanding around tech and

1664
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,240
uh surveillance the surveillance economy

1665
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,799

1671

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,799
privacy camp 2022

1693
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,079
it's been a challenge some of the

1694
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,520
technical hitches and of course the

1695
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,280
downsides the unfortunate thing that we

1696
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,839
can't all gather over a glass of wine or

1697
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,599
a shared coffee to say what we all

1698
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,760
thought of it today so hopefully in

1699
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,440
coming years that will come back but we

1700
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,839
celebrated 10 years of it so at least we

1701
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,359
were all able to gather today there's

1702
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,240
been a lot of content if like me feeling

1703
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,599
a little overwhelmed you were taking

1704
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,839
notes perhaps give yourself a breather

1705
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,280
and come back in a day or two and look

1706
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,039
at the recordings so that you can

1707
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,720
refresh your memory but you can still

1708
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,280

forward to

1783
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,480
watching some of the recording but some

1784
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,640
of the main takeaways

1785
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,760
um

1786
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,319
show to us especially as we discuss you

1787
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,559
know whether human rights can be at the

1788
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,280
center of digital policies or

1789
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,200
who has been left out

1790
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,440
by by this discussion on digital rights

1791
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,000
i think we've discussed you know some of

1792
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,079
the limits of the data protection of

1793
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,160
primary or privacy

1794
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,520
framings to address all of the issues um

1795
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,799
of our times and especially in times of

1796
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,440
big data the the importance of seeing

1797
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,400
digital rights generally as one of the

1798
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
other collective instruments

1799
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,960
um that movements such as the digital

1800
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,799
rights movement can use you know for

1801
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:04,720
people democracy and and the planet um

1802
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,200
another big takeaway and that also uh

1803
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,799
was one of the takeaway of the last

1804
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,440
panel i attended on on

1805
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,440
where we are in terms of mid-term

1806
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,079
mandate is that it's really important to

1807
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,559
build coalitions across movements

1808
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,640
um and that we cannot do it you know

1809
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,559
deal with the challenges alone some of

1810
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,680
you have spoken of a tsunami or an

1811
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,640
avalanche of digital rights proposal and

1812
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,280
digital policy proposal uh in europe but

1813
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,960
also another part of the world so it's

1814
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,520
very important we build these coalitions

1815
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:36,960
um

1816
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,359
so what are the next steps uh first um i

1817
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,760
will ask you to please take a minute to

1818

01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,960
in the face of inc you know increasingly

1848
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,119
huge corporate lobbying that we are

1849
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,720
facing um

1850
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,039

edge regram our newsletter um

1854
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,799
and i would also like to invite you to

1855
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,799
to look at the projects that we are

1856
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,960
leading together with the digital

1857
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,280
freedom fund around decolonizing the

1858
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,880
digital right field

1859
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,920
um i think um

1860
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,238
anna in her opening remarks and and

1861
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,679
several of you have mentioned it

1862
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,679
throughout the day but

1863
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,080
i think it spoke to why we're holding

1864
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,479
that that theme today with privacy camp

1865
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,799
and why do we need to also self-reflect

1866
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,158
about

1867
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,479
the composition and the dynamics within

1868
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,719
our movement

1869
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:37,520
and

1870
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,000
with that i think i will also invite you

1871
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,040
to come into video if you can some of

1872
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,880
you who are still around we like to take

1873
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,479
a group picture

1874
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,520
um

1875
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,399
and then i also leave you in the capable

1876
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,279
hands of jen and other of our colleagues

1877
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,920
to um to try to take that picture thank

1878
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,960
you very much and thanks to jen uh for a

1879
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,920
wonderfully facilitated day thank you

1880
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,560
for being with us um and looking forward

1881
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,000
to more additions to privacy camp

1882
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,238
thank you claire um well i'm just here

1883
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,920
as a cheerleader and really enthusiastic

1884
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,520
at this point i can see everyone

1885
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,000
gradually switching on their cameras i

1886
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,759
suspect guillermo is probably the

1887
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,399
technical genius behind this

1888
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,799
and perhaps if we get as many people

1889
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,960
with their cameras on as possible

1890
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,640
and then whoever's going to take the

1891
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,080
picture i guess you can go into settings

1892
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,399
and prioritize

1893
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:33,520
video

1894
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,158
and that should give us a nice

1895
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,839
collage that we can take a picture of

1896
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,040
especially if you want to check out what

1897
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,719
you look like come on we need another

1898
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,799
couple of people to fill up this collage

1899
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,640
i know we can't meet in person but it's

1900
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,679
uh it's worth having at least a shot of

1901
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,719
all the people waving at the camera

1902
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,839
okay three two one big wave

1903
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,440
thanks everyone thanks sock puppet at

1904
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,120
the bottom i hope someone's taking a

1905
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,360
screenshot of that um all rights
