1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,240
where they expect also to set targets to

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
member states including in the field of

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,200
sovereignty

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,559
and we we see that acceleration into

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
centering sovereignty again

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,359
probably because of realization of uh

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
risk of data losses or threats including

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,359
um

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,920
data transfers to the u.s after shrimp's

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
two uh case

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,080
but also with the pandemic has kind of

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,880
exercised the kind of risk of outages

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
especially of critical infrastructures

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,399
in europe

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,040
and elsewhere but also i think the

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
increased kind of awareness including

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
among people about our dependency to to

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
big tech and to big tech services and

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
infrastructures whether in our schools

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,039
university our health system and others

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,079
so i'm really um happy to dive into that

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,320
discussion and and really understand

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
where are where is the consideration for

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
human rights in this debate

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,000
and how both the dependency on big tech

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
but also solutions that are centering uh

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,760
sovereignty

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,400
affects uh all of us and especially

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
people at the margins

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
so i want to welcome cedar garcias who

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,119
with the same question you know if you

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
can answer briefly of course i

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
understand that this a very vast topic

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,680
to understand what is your definition of

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,479
of digital and technological sovereignty

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,439
and what do you think it should be

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,520
i'll start with estelle

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
invitation and congrats to adriana

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
on another great uh privacy camp um

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
so uh

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,800
this conversation i think is

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
really about power and

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,280
the definition to me

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
uh i think they could be true on what i

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
think different actor means by it and

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
what it should mean or it could mean um

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
for for us and for and for people who

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
are at the moment not representing in

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
this conversation what i mean by power

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,040
is that it's a result of a power dynamic

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
and a power struggle mostly between

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
private actors and governments where

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,319
governments are realizing as you

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
mentioned clear that we're slowly

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
losing control over critical

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
infrastructure over infrastructure in

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
general

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,239
and there is this sort of push back and

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
callback of government trying to regain

72
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,040
that control and this is where the word

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
sovereignty comes into place in order to

74
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,879
regain some some degree of autonomy and

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
don't have to depend on those private

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,879
actors when you want to develop kobe

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,720
tracing apps for instance when you want

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
to develop a health system when you want

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
to develop school automated system

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
things like that

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
but the point that is missing in those

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
conversations at the moment is what is

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
the sovereignty component for

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
for internet users for app users and for

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,120
people in general um

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,120
it's it's a power dynamic between two

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
actors and that are supposed to be

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,239
serving a third one that is not

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,239
representing those conversations and it

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
is um which role is not interpreted

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
there and so when

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
we're having conversation about digital

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
sovereignty we should actually have a

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
conversation about digital checks and

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
balances and what elements of of control

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
we can put back for the user that are

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
supposed to be served by

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,280
the public and private services at its

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,440
core

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
thank you thank you so much for that uh

101
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
framing discussion in terms of power uh

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
frank what is your definition

103
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,959
it's really hard to say this in just a

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,840
few

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,920
few words

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,958
it's really about

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
being in control of your

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,879
digital

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,798
destiny your digital life

110
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,639
the interesting thing about digital

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
sovereignty is that it's a

112
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
term that is a meaning from

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
a government perspective

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,160
the government should be

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
sovereign but also

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
for individuals

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
um

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
because also like people

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
should be in control of their

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,479
of their digital life basically

121
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,360
um

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
and as estelle already said

123
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
the interesting thing is

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,160
that

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
private actors like big tech

126
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
is um

127
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
is in control at the moment as a de

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,320
facto i mean not legally but as de facto

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
there and controlling the digital

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,759
destiny of

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,000
um yeah most of the world

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,039
um

133
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
and that's something that's not healthy

134
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,479
um

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,360
on

136
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
many aspects from an individual

137
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
perspective

138
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
privacy

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,919
but also from an economic perspective

140
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,000
it's just not

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
such a huge concentration of power is

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
not just not healthy for the planet um

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,639
and i think digital sovereignty

144
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
is a term

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
that um

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
for me means

147
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
that

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
people should be in control of their

149
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
life

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
more government

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
smaller companies

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
individuals

153
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,039
and not be de facto

154
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,600
or controlled by

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
big i.t companies

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
somewhere else especially if they're

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,759
not even

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
respecting

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
local legal state legislation because

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
they're just based in another part of

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
the world

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
so that's what it means for me

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
thank you

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
and say that

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
all right so um thanks claire for um

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
having us here and congratulations on

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
the privacy camp 10th edition super

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
exciting

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
um i just want to take a little bit of a

170
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,280
historical view um on both computing

171
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
itself and in terms of physical

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,080
sovereignty

173
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
um i'd like to invite you to think about

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
computing as a post-world war ii control

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
technology so it's great that the term

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,400
control came up in both estell and

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
frank's introduction

178
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,360
but i would like to think about

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,319
computing as a technology of control

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,720
that we have now been able to expand to

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,639
the point that we can apply it to all

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
the things

183
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,759
to open up that some more

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
in the mid mid of the middle of the 20th

185
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,000
century powerful political

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,759
and economic forces

187
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,400
especially post world war ii gave rise

188
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
to computing computers were a

189
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,639
technological innovation of control and

190
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
to be more specific operational control

191
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,360
it was informed by a world war ii

192
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
management of military the technology

193
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
was um also informed by deep distrust in

194
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,120
humans following the use of the nuclear

195
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
bomb and many other atrocities of world

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,360
war ii and the desire to build control

197
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
technologies that had had at least two

198
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,199
driving forces they were aimed at

199
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
removing the autonomy of individuals

200
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
something that manifests itself in

201
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,759
designs that implement distributed trust

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,840
and to build control systems that could

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
bring powerful opponents of the cold war

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,400
to their knees

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,080
in this history we see the first

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
instances of a battle for digital

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,599
sovereignty

208
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
thanks to some great historical work by

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,360
kessenia tatarchenko um we know that in

210
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,280
1966 charles the goal downgraded

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
france's membership in nato

212
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,280
which i guess is a military alliance as

213
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,560
many of you know

214
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,879
this semi-departure from nato had to do

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,120
with the unfulfilled desire of france to

216
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
integrate its own nuclear deterrence

217
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
into the alliance

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,199
three months after the

219
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
the gold struck um

220
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,960
an agreement with the soviets to do

221
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,520
research on computer science

222
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
and in general the reason the goal was

223
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
taking these actions was because they

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,919
wanted to challenge american domination

225
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
of the computing market and specifically

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
the french computer mark computing

227
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,120
market

228
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
as part of this program the goal also

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
nationalized a belgian norwegian

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
computer company called bull and founded

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,919
the institute nacional

232
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
informatica automatic india

233
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
this is kind of maybe the first digital

234
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
sovereignty move even though it wasn't

235
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,559
called that at the time

236
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
however over the decades developments in

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
computing became more commercialized

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
what was originally a military

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,480
technology was enhanced and further

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
developed through what i will shorthand

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
as the business of computing

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
moving from mainframes to personal

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
computers to web-based services the

244
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,399
business of computing has given to us

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
what we today consider computational

246
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
infrastructures

247
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
the cloud infrastructures that we have

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,399
with mobile devices as its accessories

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
with decreasing autonomy for the

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,839
individuals because that mobile devices

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,519
are controlled through the clouds and

252
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
there's practically no software

253
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,320
production outside of these

254
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,839
computational infrastructures which i

255
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,440
know frank is an alternative to so we'll

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,959
come back to that

257
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,720
these computational infrastructures have

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
become so powerful that is close to um

259
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
impossible to produce software and

260
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
distribute compute independent of them

261
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
and most of the hardware production that

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,040
we have today including microprocessors

263
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
to not networking devices are optimized

264
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
for their market driven needs

265
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
this is significant as i said earlier

266
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
powerful political economic and social

267
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,360
forces gave rise to these computational

268
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,839
infrastructures with great capabilities

269
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,880
of control what we see now is that these

270
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
computational infrastructures have

271
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,959
become so powerful that they have set

272
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,200
free their own economic political and

273
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,720
social forces

274
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,399
computational infrastructures there have

275
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
come to threaten the forces that gave

276
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
rise to them to begin with

277
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
for me therefore digital sovereignty

278
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
represents the reflex of nation-states

279
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
forefronted by prominent figures of the

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
cold war era grabbing back on known

281
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
tricks like nationalism

282
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
very apparent in the case of u.s france

283
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,320
and germany market dominance and claims

284
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
the global power to respond to the

285
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,399
transformations brought about by

286
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,160
computational infrastructure so it's an

287
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
old bag of tricks applied to respond to

288
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
let's call it big tech

289
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
and what we've also seen in the last

290
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
decade is that this response has been

291
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,079
extended to include things like the use

292
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,920
of open source technologies data

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
protection et cetera to make claims of

294
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,320
digital software team

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,000
so this is just a kind of political view

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
there's also an activist view but let's

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,880
come back to that in discussion so let's

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
just i'll i'll leave it there for now

299
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
thank you

300
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,519
thank you so much siddha for this

301
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,000
historical perspective it's it's quite

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
interesting to see how the the concept

303
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,959
evolved and how it found its its sources

304
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
also in nationalism

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,519
um

306
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,640
so i'll continue with you um you know i

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
i like to understand like what you think

308
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
are some of the most problematic aspects

309
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
of our dominance on on big tech and on

310
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,760
dominant tech infrastructures and

311
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,040
services

312
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
um what some of us have called like

313
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,640
digital colonialism and how it affects

314
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,360
like people at the margin um

315
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,160
also because to to answer frank's point

316
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
about taking back control

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,040
um how can we how can users be in

318
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,640
control uh in in um in a word that is

319
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,440
dominate that we know we have no choices

320
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
and especially uh the most vulnerable of

321
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
us so could you could you dive into that

322
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
a little

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
yeah i mean i think um i think it's um i

324
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
think there are some suggestions as to

325
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
what we want or aim for

326
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
um from more activist perspective in

327
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,079
terms of digital sovereignty is

328
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,800
individual control over our data

329
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
i personally think that's a kind of

330
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
misplaced understanding of

331
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
the computational infrastructures we

332
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
have i think what we see

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
is not only a dependency on somebody

334
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
else's server like the cloud

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,320
but the fact that any mean like the main

336
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
means through which software reaches

337
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
millions and billions of people has to

338
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
go through the few tech companies and

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
the kind of software production

340
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
practices that they

341
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,440
push forward like micro

342
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,360
microservices or agile development

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
mechanisms and service architectures at

344
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
all um overall to begin with um and what

345
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,600
i see these companies especially doing

346
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
is trying to capture they've kind of

347
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,519
captured individuals in many ways right

348
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,279
like they're in our pockets they can

349
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,800
address us in many ways i don't think

350
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,079
they know anything about us but they

351
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
have an infrastructure that makes us

352
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
addressable through their

353
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
infrastructures which gives a lot of

354
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
companies and governments dependence on

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,560
them to reach us right and so the other

356
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
market i think that they're now trying

357
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
to go for through the cloud especially

358
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
is institutions so this is kind of what

359
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
you refer to claire in in your opening

360
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,440
talk um the way in which you know

361
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
especially with covet we saw the

362
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,680
acceleration of it

363
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
being replaced with cloud-based services

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
um these this transformation what let's

365
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,600
call it digital transformation is not

366
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
just the removal of i.t and internal

367
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
expertise of institutions but a complete

368
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
revamping of what it means to be an

369
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,480
institution both in terms of governance

370
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,360
economics and dependency on technologies

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
of others

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
so what i see i can't explain it in

373
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,279
great detail is a kind of gutting out of

374
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
basic institutions

375
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
through scalable services that are

376
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,839
dependent on the clouds that are driven

377
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
by financial forces

378
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
i think that if you want to go back to

379
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
your question on fundamental rights i do

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
believe that we need institutions to

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
create societies in which individuals

382
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
can be protected and can practice and

383
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,839
exercise their fundamental rights and if

384
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,199
we lose these

385
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,600
institutions that it is impossible to

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
for us to exercise our our

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
fundamental rights

388
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
now there's a problem institutions have

389
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,000
historically um especially in europe

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
fail to respond to the needs of

391
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
underrepresented communities racialized

392
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
communities or they have been actively

393
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
part of racializing certain communities

394
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,720
especially immigrants um so i think

395
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,399
it is on the one hand very depressing

396
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,320
that these organizations are being

397
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,160
especially public institutions are being

398
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
gutted out by big tech through the

399
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,279
service architectures and cloud

400
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,800
dependencies

401
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
but at the same time i do think this is

402
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,120
a moment to reclaim those institutions

403
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
not just technologically but also in

404
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
their vision of serving exactly the

405
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
communities that we're interested in and

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,639
fundamental rights

407
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
thank you so much uh for for bringing

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
back the discussion on like how do we do

409
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
collective advocacy to to reclaim these

410
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,839
institutions and and sometimes move away

411
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
from the frames that we you know we have

412
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,760
uh frank

413
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
could you could you maybe explain also

414
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
from from an insider perspective what

415
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
some of the european companies but also

416
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
technologists have done to increase our

417
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,519
resilience or sovereignty but also how

418
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,320
did

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
microsoft in particular but also other

420
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,760
big tech companies have reacted to

421
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,320
these moves

422
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
yeah i'm happy to um let me first go

423
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,959
back to uh your earlier questions um

424
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,639
because i think it's important for the

425
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,120
context i think it's quite fascinating

426
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,839
to

427
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,880
to see

428
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,079
what big

429
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,079
big tech companies specifically

430
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,079
microsoft are doing

431
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
the last few years so as mentioned

432
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
already by theta

433
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,199
microsoft

434
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
invented the software licensing business

435
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,839
right i already invented the business of

436
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,000
selling software licenses

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,320
and with this business model became like

438
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,360
the richest biggest company in the world

439
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
like the 90s

440
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,600
and they had control over their

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,120
customers because the software was

442
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,519
proprietary not open source and they

443
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
also controlled the file formats

444
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
like the office document file format so

445
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
this was basically their way to grab the

446
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
power and to become the richest company

447
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,759
in the world

448
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,240
um the file format war

449
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
was going on like 20 years ago

450
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,399
with the

451
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,360
mr push by the eu to um

452
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,959
to create open file formats basically um

453
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
but that was not a complete win but

454
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,040
there was some some pushback but it's

455
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
really interesting because microsoft

456
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,160
decided

457
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
that this power grab is not even big

458
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
enough um like 10 years ago so they

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
abandoned their own business model with

460
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
selling software licenses which they

461
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,959
invented and became the biggest most

462
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,880
powerful company in the world they

463
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
abandoned this business model and said

464
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,959
okay we do something even more powerful

465
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,959
we move completely to software as a

466
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,320
service to cloud-based uh computing

467
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
so now you know don't even of course the

468
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
software is still proprietary the file

469
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,759
formats are still a problem but you

470
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,920
don't even get the software anymore to

471
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,480
install it where you want you just use

472
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,359
software as a service from the cloud

473
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
which is then you can pay and then you

474
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,119
have access to

475
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,919
your files all the tools your co-workers

476
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
or you stop paying then you're out

477
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
so this is like and there's no way to

478
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
migrate it to somewhere else by the way

479
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,720
um because they are not i mean maybe you

480
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
can download your files but there's no

481
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
way to export your chat history or your

482
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,760
whatever all your complicated structured

483
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
data and even if you could there's no

484
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,160
other application that can read like all

485
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
these experts so this is like the

486
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,080
biggest power grab ever

487
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,360
um and another big interesting aspect is

488
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
how it works from a contract perspective

489
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
so the german government for example i

490
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
have some insights there

491
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,760
is

492
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,799
has as

493
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,600
all every big organization has um

494
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
contracts with microsoft but this were

495
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
like contracts to get software licenses

496
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,640
to be hosted internally as they want and

497
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
these contracts are basically

498
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
transformed from software licenses

499
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
licensing contracts to cloud

500
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,080
software as a service contracts

501
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
right and then basically the governments

502
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
are being forced basically to lose even

503
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,840
more control to push into the cloud

504
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,520
and that's something that's uh that's

505
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
obviously um yeah a big problem because

506
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
there's no way out again this is like

507
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
the ultimate move

508
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,760
you can never get out of this contracts

509
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,400
or

510
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
this cloud

511
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
situation anymore this is why it's so

512
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,480
important to really fight back

513
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
and there are lots of different levels

514
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
where you can fight back there is like

515
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
you have to fight back from a contract

516
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
perspective you really and there's some

517
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,360
initiatives going on in the governments

518
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
that this contracts need to be revisited

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,240
then um it needs that need to be open

520
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
source

521
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
self-hosted alternatives this is like

522
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,280
the mission of next cloud so we try to

523
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
build like this alternative to microsoft

524
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,799
365 google workspace and so on but open

525
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
source so you can look inside you can

526
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,760
make sure there are no vectors you can

527
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,120
really um see what's happening and that

528
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
it's

529
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,840
also hosted where you want you can host

530
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,919
the data internally like the french

531
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,520
government or the german government that

532
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
infrastructure which is just internally

533
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
not even connected to the internet

534
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
right this is not even possible with

535
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
google or microsoft this only works with

536
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
open source software

537
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,320
so this is um really key and open source

538
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,160
alternatives are also important like for

539
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
the poorer areas in the world right not

540
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
every everybody can afford um like

541
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
microsoft subscription right if you're

542
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
like a student like in in the

543
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,720
underdeveloped region of the world well

544
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
good luck buying a microsoft

545
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
subscription to get access to

546
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
state-of-the-art software so you really

547
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,919
need there needs to be open source

548
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,280
alternatives

549
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
and um yeah that's something that is

550
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,400
absolutely absolutely key and then i

551
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,520
will stop

552
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,360
talking too much

553
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,799
maybe later i can also talk a little bit

554
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,440
about the antitrust complaint which is

555
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
another angle that needs to

556
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,159
it

557
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,840
needs to be used to fight microsoft here

558
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
thank you yes um i have i have more

559
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,960
questions about also what can be done

560
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
and how can

561
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
maybe

562
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
governments and institutions in europe

563
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,559
like promote alternatives and can help

564
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,360
that move but i i wanted to go to

565
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,000
estelle now and um

566
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,039
use the data protection framework to

567
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,520
you know to to question the concept of

568
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,159
sovereignty there's many aspects and it

569
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
can be quite technical but what i'm

570
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,039
interested to know is is from a data

571
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,760
protection or a privacy perspective uh

572
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,840
where data collection processing and

573
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
transfers are happening in a global

574
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,799
world that does sovereignty even make

575
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,760
sense

576
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,200
um

577
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
also because the gdpr has extra

578
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
territorial uh impact but um

579
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,960
if sovereignty is not the concept to

580
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
center what are then the principles in

581
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
these cross-border

582
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
transfers whether commercial or law

583
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,760
enforcement uses

584
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
thank you um i think to answer this

585
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,159
question i need to continue or build a

586
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,480
little bit on what um seda has explained

587
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,559
on the historical conversation around

588
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
digital sovereignty which was really

589
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
fascinating and um

590
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
i i only looked at it from uh from a

591
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,440
subcomponent of it from the data

592
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
sovereignty conversation so i may i'm

593
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
going to be missing some point here so

594
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,320
i'd love to further connect with saddam

595
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
how to build the tube but

596
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,480
i i started looking basically over the

597
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
past few years on how the concept of

598
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
data sovereignty popped up in brussels

599
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,120
conversation and where this was coming

600
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,080
from

601
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,559
um where this bush was coming from it

602
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
really and

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
got a lot of um

604
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,320
a lot of um wind in brussels and started

605
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,840
being picked up a lot when a

606
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
commissioner both on the french

607
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
commissioner um arrived and starting

608
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
putting those those discussion around

609
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
data wars and data control and data

610
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
sovereignty in brussels

611
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
and so in in starting looking a little

612
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
bit this came from a lot of conversation

613
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
also in france around the same concept

614
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
sometime

615
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,880
increased

616
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,760
around

617
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
beyond data sovereignty to digital

618
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
sovereignty and the fact that this

619
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
assumption that the the commissioner has

620
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
communicated about that europe and

621
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,799
france

622
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,440
a lot of time had lost the

623
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,720
quote and quote war on data to the u.s

624
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
and

625
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,520
this is something that

626
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
i personally pushed back a lot on um

627
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,720
because i think it's it's a wrong

628
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
framing i think europe chose a really

629
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
different past than the us one that was

630
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,799
driven by tech and private interest of

631
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
harvesting data in europe chose and

632
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,720
tried to resist in more

633
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
protective framing one that people would

634
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,039
maintain certain level of control but

635
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
all of this obviously fell through when

636
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
you're in a scenario where there is um

637
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,640
those private actors don't only just

638
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
define the role of the game but also

639
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,320
become the infrastructure and are able

640
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,720
to push back against any legislation

641
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
that government tried to put forward to

642
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,120
try to maintain a level of institution

643
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
and a level of control for people

644
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,559
just because even though they're

645
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,240
technically supposed to be respecting

646
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,360
our legislation they just have de facto

647
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
with the control they have over

648
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
infrastructure so much power that they

649
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,159
are able to influence those legislation

650
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,600
just by the type of standards they may

651
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
be pushing the type of processes they

652
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,840
may be put in place and this creates

653
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
this this impression from from state

654
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
actors that

655
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,799
they have lost the control that the

656
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,720
control is in the end of the us and what

657
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,880
i think they mean by the us here is a

658
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
group of companies based in the us more

659
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
than the us government for instance

660
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
and try to wanting to gain back this

661
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,919
control sorry this this war framing is

662
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,520
existing even though we're not

663
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,400
technically in a conflict but um that we

664
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,240
europe has to fight back and because the

665
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
personal data war control over personal

666
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
data was lost toward those private

667
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,640
actors europe should be gearing up and

668
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,039
being prepared of winning what

669
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,480
the commissioner brought is referring to

670
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,120
the industrial data war so having this

671
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
is where you see the push for

672
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,679
uh you know sovereign clouds to be there

673
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
for um data acts to be there in order to

674
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,240
try to maintain control over some type

675
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,799
of data that should stay in europe

676
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,200
and be controlled by europe and a lot of

677
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,799
the time here privacy and data

678
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,039
protection argument are being advanced

679
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
and they are positive measure on those

680
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,640
fronts but really what seda pointed to

681
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,799
is that those are

682
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,799
those points are being used as tool for

683
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,200
the greater nationalistic perspective of

684
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
like we want this control we as the

685
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
state want the control here and really

686
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
ultimately the goal is not to give us or

687
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
to give people more privacy or more

688
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,960
personal control over

689
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,039
um over this information and in this

690
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,520
context the the data conversation is

691
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,320
only

692
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,120
one aspect of the larger

693
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
control graph power graph that is

694
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
happening between

695
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,640
getting state and private actors now

696
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,320
does this mean that there is no

697
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
potential for more for positive changes

698
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,919
within those framing that we could be

699
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
using to our advantage since you know

700
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
privacy and data protection or other

701
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,159
fundamental right are being advanced by

702
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,159
statister as a sort of justification for

703
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,520
those moves even though they might not

704
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
be the underlying rational to it

705
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,640
um i do think there is a an overall

706
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
issue with the rational that mean that

707
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
we would

708
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
always potentially be an outlier in it

709
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
and so there is a need to have a

710
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,559
conversation of reframing

711
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,679
this debate and also making understand

712
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,120
the danger of a sovereignty conversation

713
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
um when it's happening between the you

714
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,559
and the u.s you know to big western

715
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
countries and how other countries are

716
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,279
picking up on it and using it to justify

717
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,520
their abuse they are data protection law

718
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,120
and previously law being promoted in

719
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,880
egypt india and russia

720
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,240
their protection measures that are

721
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,640
actually hurting people and are being

722
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,039
discussed over the term saying like it's

723
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
about data sovereignty and they're just

724
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,200
being used for you know the egyptian

725
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,480
government to control what the

726
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,080
population is doing the indian and

727
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
russian government to localize all the

728
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
data within their borders so that their

729
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
intelligence authority can look into it

730
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
and control dissident and journalists

731
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,600
etc etc so by allowing this framing to

732
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
exist it is being justified being used

733
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,720
by

734
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
other countries and that leads to human

735
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
rights human rights abuse as well so

736
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
there are the danger of that framing in

737
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,799
the first place the danger of

738
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,640
issue we're trying to defend being

739
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
misused and used against us

740
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,200
and there is the losing the perspective

741
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
of like okay you're fighting for a model

742
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
you're fighting to

743
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
you think if we think about the eu

744
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
perspective you think you lost that war

745
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
okay fair enough i disagree i think we

746
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,960
choose a different approach that was a

747
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,000
better approach and we should double

748
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,520
learn on the other person and so you

749
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
think you lose that part and your

750
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,919
reaction is to be okay so now we will

751
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
win the second battle by using the same

752
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,840
strategy even though we already know we

753
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,600
lost the infrastructure and you kind of

754
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,840
admit that we do gaia x but we still ask

755
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
those actors that control everything to

756
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
be the underlying infrastructure

757
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
how strategically do you think it's

758
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
going to go for you like how do you

759
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,279
think you're going to win this battle

760
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,200
i think instead the really the path for

761
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,559
the eu it's to double down on its

762
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,159
approach it's like okay let's be true

763
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,960
about protecting human rights protecting

764
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
protecting freedom and values

765
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,320
and

766
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
make sure that we give ourselves a mean

767
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,640
to implement the privacy changes we want

768
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,399
to do to implement open source to

769
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,399
implement open government and open data

770
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,760
which are being pushed by a lot of

771
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,840
government actually as frank mentioned

772
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
and are just not capitalized on it and

773
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,840
this means you know reviewing the way eu

774
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,159
does investment in input money and

775
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,159
innovation you know we we put for a good

776
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,159
legislation but then we also give a lot

777
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,679
of money for like surveillance at the

778
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,279
borders everywhere for surveillance

779
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
tools to be developed and that there's

780
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,279
just not a line in policies there we

781
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,039
develop good legislation but we don't do

782
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,480
any effort in making sure they're

783
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
enforced and delivered and so if we're

784
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
just being a bit logical and where we

785
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,320
could want to do

786
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,679
we could be

787
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,679
we we could open up a different past i

788
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
think the the sovereignty discussion is

789
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,200
just that

790
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
lose result for the government in the

791
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
long run and for for people in europe

792
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
but also elsewhere on how this this

793
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
framing will be abused specifically in

794
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
the context of data now

795
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
i reckon that my

796
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,200
my vision on it may be tuner on data and

797
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,679
there is a larger i think uh digital

798
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
component of it with infrastructure that

799
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,080
france frankenstein was

800
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
really delve into and

801
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,679
i'm quite interesting to see how all of

802
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,039
them might

803
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
my deal in two places but it's um it's

804
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,960
really it's really creating a lot of i

805
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,279
think global issue also and this is what

806
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,279
fundamentally is blocking also some some

807
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,120
of the cross-border data issue that you

808
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
you mentioned clear on like the

809
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,960
countries just fighting each other and

810
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
none of them wanting to reform

811
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
turbulence with the grail of like being

812
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
sovereign and controlling but who lose

813
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,480
in this scenario all of us being

814
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
surveilled and take companies you know

815
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
continuing doing harvesting model

816
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,080
because it served those sovereignty

817
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,320
and justification

818
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
you so much for that perspective estelle

819
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
um and you already hinted to some of the

820
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,440
choices that that we we are facing and

821
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
i'll come back to that um after the q a

822
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,799
but i wanted you know yo so uh name

823
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,200
dropped gaia x and i i wanted to hear

824
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,520
from frank um a little bit of the

825
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,159
background or your perspective on on how

826
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
that is going on kind of the original

827
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,120
idea and how the project is evolving

828
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
and then in the while you're doing so

829
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,760
i'm also opening um the chat for for any

830
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
questions to plan

831
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,840
yes um i'm happy to yeah guys that's an

832
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,760
interesting

833
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,039
interesting

834
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,640
topic

835
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
and i'm only sharing in my personal

836
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,320
opinion right there are like lots of

837
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,799
opinions about critics out there

838
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,960
so um i personally was involved since

839
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
the very beginning

840
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
um it was originally initiated by the

841
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,480
german gov ministry of economics

842
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,559
and was involved in some discussions at

843
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,559
the beginning before it even had its its

844
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,679
name

845
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,919
um the idea was

846
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,039
quite

847
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,320
clear

848
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,559
and and bold which is like

849
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,240
europe needs

850
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
um cloud infrastructure

851
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,600
to to be able to compete with china and

852
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,799
the u.s

853
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,520
this was the was the hr idea very clear

854
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,039
i mean like i don't know

855
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,679
elevate a pitch in one sentence

856
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,720
um

857
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,559
then the discussion was

858
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,919
um should this be done following the um

859
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,520
the airbus model um some of you might

860
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,279
remember

861
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,960
not that old or know from the history

862
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,360
books how airbus was founded it was

863
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
europe at the time realized that europe

864
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,159
needs an alternative to boeing

865
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,760
and its airbus was founded as one huge

866
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,039
company um with um

867
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,960
based in different countries but one big

868
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
company to build like an alternative to

869
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,840
boeing

870
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,320
uh in europe and then the question was

871
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,919
okay should we do the same for cloud

872
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,080
should there be a cloud air airbus

873
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,039
and that decision was that's a bad idea

874
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,880
and i agree with that

875
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
and instead gaiax is supposed to be a

876
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,399
federated system between all those

877
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,480
mid-sized cloud companies

878
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,200
in in europe it's basically a set of

879
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,039
standards and apis and open source

880
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,519
implementations that connect

881
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,080
all the medium small medium-sized cloud

882
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,840
companies together and become like a

883
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,720
virtual hyperscaler basically this was

884
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
the original idea

885
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
the idea i think was very good other

886
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,360
governments in europe joined the

887
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,919
initiatives france first and then

888
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,840
several others

889
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,320
and then was announced and become quite

890
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,799
big at least in press and hundreds of

891
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
companies joined this initiative

892
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,039
and then unfortunately a mistake was

893
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
made i think in my opinion

894
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,279
it was allowed that the u.s cloud

895
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,559
companies actually also joined kaya x

896
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,399
there were a discussion um if this is a

897
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,919
good idea because what the original

898
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,440
mission was to have an alternative to

899
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
them how can they be a member now

900
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,760
and that the decision was that okay

901
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,039
there can be a member but i don't have

902
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,519
any voting rights

903
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
um and that's that's okay they cannot

904
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,120
vote but they are still in the working

905
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
groups and they do

906
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
what they always do they're just like um

907
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,120
go in there and flood everything with

908
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,000
endless discussions endless papers

909
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
and less specifications endless

910
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,840
certifications

911
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,279
and um

912
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,080
yeah gaiax really lost its vision from

913
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
my opinion

914
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,760
um i'm sure they will produce some

915
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,240
certification some stand out something

916
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,480
at some point but i

917
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
don't think it will really change the

918
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,799
cloud ecosystem in europe i'm sorry i

919
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,440
bit the solution there it's it's just

920
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
the usual

921
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,159
usual tactics of of big tech

922
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
you can also destroy something from the

923
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,440
inside

924
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,799
which i think is what's happening here

925
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
thank you for that frank and i think

926
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,559
also it shows the the limits of um kind

927
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,440
of the self-regulatory or the labeling

928
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,480
certification kind of model um

929
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,399
so we have two questions uh one is about

930
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,080
whether uh

931
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,279
the digital infrastructure made of 100

932
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,799
fiber optics

933
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,480
uh ftth and next cloud everywhere and uh

934
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,200
would would be a perfect frame um and

935
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
i'll leave the

936
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
expert answering on that

937
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
um

938
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,559
frank maybe or others would would you

939
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,039
would we have kind of an alternative to

940
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,960
what a perfect infrastructure would look

941
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
like

942
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,360
i don't know

943
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
with all these discussions i'm always

944
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,360
have the

945
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,679
opinion gut feeling

946
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,559
that we should not try to

947
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,440
copy china or the us here but find a

948
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,279
european way

949
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,639
so the strength of europe is

950
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,280
that we are not centralized

951
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
that we have lots of different

952
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
countries and languages and cultures and

953
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,399
everything diversity

954
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,399
from europe is about diversity

955
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,480
and the solution for this tech problems

956
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
also have to be in in my opinion in a

957
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,960
diverse way

958
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,079
so

959
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,520
basically have an ecosystem have an

960
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,040
economy of lots of small medium-sized

961
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,359
players that work together they compete

962
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
with each other and they can

963
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,399
innovate

964
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,839
and

965
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,079
and build up this infrastructure and

966
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
that's the same for the

967
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,960
for the infrastructure with fiber and

968
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,719
chip manufacturing and all the other

969
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,560
basically low-level topics but also on

970
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,320
the more high level like a software

971
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,800
business same what next door is doing

972
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,240
so i think this is something that we

973
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,160
want i don't think any initiative of

974
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,040
like

975
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
i don't know let's

976
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,920
do one huge initiative have one huge

977
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,119
company which like is i don't know

978
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,440
build is building everything up in in in

979
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
europe as a single player

980
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
as it works in china right it's

981
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,520
centralized controlled and the us is

982
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,960
sometimes similar

983
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,800
i don't think that's a good idea i think

984
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
we should

985
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,960
basically

986
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,440
believe in our european values and use

987
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,359
those as uh

988
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,040
as a strength to um yeah to build the

989
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,359
future

990
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,119
thank you

991
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,440
uh can i uh yeah

992
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,400
thank you very much uh frankie and uh

993
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,560
congratulations for an extra 23 that you

994
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,920
have just released that is a really

995
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
great milestone

996
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,960
uh super buried

997
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,720
um

998
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,440
so

999
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,839
answering to estelle about the digital

1000
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,160
digital infrastructures so i think that

1001
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,960
fiber optics ft edge everywhere in all

1002
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,680
the houses public institutions and

1003
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,800
companies

1004
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
is the best

1005
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
environment friendly technology to

1006
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
the the transmit data

1007
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
that we have today so it's the best that

1008
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,119
we can have for uh environmental

1009
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,520
enrollment topics like uh

1010
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,839
electromagnetic radiations you you

1011
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,400
reduce electronic uh electromagnetic

1012
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,079
radiations that are not good for health

1013
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,280
we know it

1014
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
um and it's more secure also so uh

1015
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
having solutions such as next cloud for

1016
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,760
the cloud or selfish os for uh mobile

1017
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,640
phones

1018
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
uh you can have uh in europe a superb uh

1019
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,280
digital infrastructure plus software

1020
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,800
hardware that is open source

1021
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
certified

1022
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,079
and working for your

1023
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,280
you control

1024
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,720
and for the good

1025
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,359
okay so this is uh we have the solutions

1026
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,200
so

1027
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,640
also li-fi is interesting to

1028
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
transmit data from the light

1029
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,839
okay with uh

1030
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,320
reduced effects on the health

1031
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,640
so because wi-fi is not neither

1032
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,720
something that is good for your health

1033
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,560
so life is better

1034
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
thank you rodol for for explaining a

1035
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,000
little bit more

1036
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,599
with the technical background what you

1037
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,280
mean but i think also

1038
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
frank is pointing to a more kind of

1039
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,640
healthy

1040
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,359
ecosystem and and the possibility of

1041
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,599
having competition and i think we've

1042
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,839
made some uh progress in terms of

1043
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,359
interoperability

1044
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,440
in some of the legislation

1045
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,960
um i wanted to to also pose a jacqueline

1046
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,440
question about the impact of the future

1047
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,320
us antitrust legislation on

1048
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,920
on some of the

1049
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,839
data protection but also the platform

1050
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
regulations uh legislation and we know

1051
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
that

1052
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,359
google and other big tech are heavily

1053
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,760
lobbying against the us antitrust

1054
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,359
legislation so

1055
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,920
anybody who wants to take that perhaps

1056
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
estelle

1057
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
sure thank you um

1058
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,320
yes i think there is

1059
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,760
quite a lot of interesting development

1060
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
happening um in the us in particular

1061
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,280
from their regulatory bodies uh

1062
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,320
the u.s congress is still quite

1063
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
inactive at the moment even though

1064
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,839
interesting you know bills are being

1065
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,079
proposed on a lot on the range of issue

1066
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,079
but like concrete action is still um

1067
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,520
we're still waiting for

1068
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,599
many phone challenges so

1069
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,640
changes

1070
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,079
in push

1071
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,000
conversation being done by the federal

1072
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,599
trade commission

1073
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,599
by several advocate generals also in the

1074
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,119
us in addressing mostly competition but

1075
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,000
issues that covers a wide range of

1076
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
other issues like like privacy like also

1077
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,440
the impact of specific technology on

1078
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,920
on different communities will be really

1079
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,480
important and i think um there is still

1080
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,640
a need to make sure that those

1081
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,480
conversations are not solely happening

1082
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,160
from a perspective of competition that

1083
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
they're a bit more comprehensive um

1084
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
but this is a bit the way things works

1085
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,359
in the us with the current model there

1086
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,359
is a lot of sectoral protection so a lot

1087
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,040
of the response might still be a little

1088
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,359
bit sexual but there is definitely

1089
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,359
a change of attitude happening from from

1090
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,440
the regulatory bodies and a change also

1091
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,760
that was initiated in a lot of u.s

1092
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,740
states

1093
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,839
[Music]

1094
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,680
often linked to the lack of action by

1095
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
congress where you know quite a number

1096
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,359
of

1097
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,599
individual states have passed

1098
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,599
pretty good privacy legislation also

1099
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,599
legislation you know banning certain

1100
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,599
types of official recognition during

1101
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,280
legislation on biometric et cetera et

1102
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,320
cetera so

1103
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,560
the our movement in the us is just we're

1104
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,599
missing a bit of more

1105
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
action in in congress and where you can

1106
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,320
see

1107
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,400
obviously the impact on lobbying and the

1108
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
fact that um a lot of companies are

1109
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
pushing backing an action but i think

1110
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,119
the the way the conversation has been

1111
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,359
involving in particular around the ftc

1112
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,240
uh in in the public seeing of those the

1113
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,440
big tech company and the power of the

1114
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
holding the u.s society is changing

1115
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
which is something that

1116
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,320
even at the time of the snowden

1117
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,640
revelation you know you would

1118
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,440
that was not still there yet people were

1119
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,079
um appalled by the abuse that happened

1120
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,160
mostly by by the public authority by the

1121
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,319
nsa but um there was not at the time

1122
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,000
there really the conversation about like

1123
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
don't the company that actually do the

1124
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
initial collection also have too much

1125
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,000
power because of the collection that is

1126
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
happening and so

1127
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,079
um yeah i do think we will will be

1128
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,599
getting closer and closer in those

1129
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,200
conversations but

1130
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,480
it still

1131
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,240
is quite disappointing i have to say

1132
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,839
that we are in 2022 um

1133
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,680
about more than 100 countries around the

1134
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,079
world have adopted really comprehensive

1135
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,720
legislation to protect privacy um

1136
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,560
and the u.s is still a huge outlier on

1137
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,040
that and honestly we need to be looking

1138
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,200
at the lobby of big tech in preventing

1139
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,119
this from happening because

1140
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,960
privacy is a right in the us

1141
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,839
constitution towards the um

1142
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,920
at least towards the public authority so

1143
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,520
why would people not have similar rights

1144
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,680
to right private actors um

1145
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,119
it's a little bit puzzling

1146
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,680
thank you estelle and also plugging here

1147
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,119
and then

1148
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,520
not next but this afternoon panel uh

1149
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,960
discussing uh the the us and eu

1150
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,359
legislations like the digital services

1151
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,599
act but also the newly introduced bill

1152
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,400
um

1153
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,240
on surveillance on banning surveillance

1154
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
advertising in the us and what what that

1155
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,359
could mean

1156
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,880
um

1157
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,240
asking if frank and seda wanted to react

1158
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,919
to any of these points or questions

1159
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
otherwise

1160
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,640
yeah no

1161
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,280
i mean i think i could take a take a

1162
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
stab at like thinking about what is a

1163
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
healthy ecosystem

1164
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,280
um and also kind of responding to the

1165
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,839
conversation with rudolf and frank

1166
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,839
so i think it really is not just about

1167
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,839
replicating the infrastructure but also

1168
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,040
what are we going to do with this

1169
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,960
technolo with this technology like what

1170
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,680
is it aimed for um i think it's

1171
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,440
important to remember that the cloud in

1172
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
the hands of big tech that we have right

1173
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
now is potentially an aberration in

1174
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,680
history very much thanks to the 2008

1175
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,079
financial crisis right with the meltdown

1176
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,720
of 2008 you know we have very few people

1177
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
who have loads of money now and

1178
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
they took their money from housing

1179
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,760
markets and pushed them into tech and

1180
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,680
then tech had to grow and in that moment

1181
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,000
they held onto the cloud so the cloud is

1182
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,240
a growth strategy right and so the

1183
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,599
question is what does it mean to

1184
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,520
replicate that growth stress strategy in

1185
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,880
europe does that mean that the

1186
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,319
governments have to push for that growth

1187
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,240
strategy and remember i said the growth

1188
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,839
strategy is about

1189
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
capturing institutions and gutting them

1190
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,480
out right or scaling them up in ways and

1191
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,760
we'll come back to the effects of that

1192
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,400
in a moment so is the idea that the

1193
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,720
european cloud does the same thing tries

1194
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,800
to attract investment investors tries to

1195
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,880
push for growth in the process cutting

1196
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,800
out institutions and giving individuals

1197
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
devices that are no longer personal

1198
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,640
devices in any way but are controlled

1199
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,119
and managed and building on a culture of

1200
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,880
software production that is absolutely

1201
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,920
dependent on on that kind of mentality

1202
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
of you know managing millions of people

1203
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
in a controlled environment in the

1204
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,079
interest of financial outcomes right um

1205
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,160
so i you know i really think there's a

1206
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
big question to be asked before we start

1207
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,160
building fiber optic whatever and a

1208
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,839
massive cloud infrastructure that is

1209
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,839
only possible because we have super rich

1210
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,760
people that pumped money into big tech

1211
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
right what does it mean to use public

1212
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,680
funds to do that i think that's a really

1213
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
hard and important question and what are

1214
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,839
we going to do with that technology or

1215
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,880
that kind of computational power

1216
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
once we have it and and here i just want

1217
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,040
to put a parenthesis the antitrust case

1218
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,640
does not question the computational

1219
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
power it questions its concentration in

1220
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
the hands of a few so it doesn't

1221
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
question the speedy production using

1222
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,440
agile methods right like um and and um

1223
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
it just says it shouldn't be owned by a

1224
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,760
few and i don't know if we just

1225
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,240
replicate its production in europe we're

1226
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,319
going to get something different and

1227
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,720
again about the healthy ecosystem i

1228
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,160
think it's really good that we use that

1229
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,200
term

1230
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,280
we are dependent on a huge supply chain

1231
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
that has been mostly breaking down

1232
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,280
during cobin and extraction of materials

1233
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,960
that pass through massive violations of

1234
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,640
fundamental rights and

1235
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,599
massive forms of exploitation that keeps

1236
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,920
inequality in the world in place so it's

1237
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
really easy to start thinking about just

1238
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
us consuming services and how can we

1239
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,560
make these services not so dependent on

1240
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,440
big tech but again we have two problems

1241
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,680
the production and the supply chain is

1242
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,599
optimized towards big tech because of

1243
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,040
their capital right like they have

1244
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,280
immense amounts of money they can buy

1245
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
and therefore determine the direction of

1246
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,880
technology we see this in

1247
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,480
microprocessors

1248
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,160
big tech has bedded on specialized

1249
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,839
compute which pushes forward machine

1250
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,319
learning and blockchain

1251
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,240
chip companies are producing towards

1252
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,240
them right like how are we going to

1253
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,079
change these supply chains both to be

1254
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
more equitable and to also

1255
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
respond to our technological needs in

1256
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,160
terms of another vision

1257
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,920
and finally with machine learning what

1258
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,680
these companies are doing is get you

1259
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,079
know pushing for scaled-up services and

1260
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,480
you know many people have talked about

1261
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,720
the environmental impact of machine

1262
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,319
learning because of its data intensive

1263
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,800
and compute intensive um

1264
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
intrinsic properties but we think very

1265
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,960
little about the fact of using machine

1266
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,599
learning to scale up farming potentially

1267
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,040
also killing not just diversity in

1268
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,119
humans but diversity in agriculture

1269
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,280
which you know causes a bunch of serious

1270
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,359
issues like the rise of viruses that

1271
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,680
produce pandemics right like so i think

1272
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,520
there's like a lot of questions to be

1273
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,160
asked um about what we want to do with

1274
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,720
this technology and what is our vision

1275
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,160
i don't know if sovereignty is the right

1276
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,400
word i know a bunch of activists have

1277
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,319
picked up the concept of technological

1278
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,599
sovereignty to think about these

1279
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,599
questions but how do we make sure that

1280
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,359
these technologies are not just serving

1281
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,520
market interests in europe or regional

1282
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,440
or national interest in europe

1283
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,119
while reproducing supply chains and

1284
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,119
extraction and exploitation

1285
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,880
but actually producing technologies of

1286
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,280
life so i think that's kind of

1287
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,970
my vision of a healthy ecosystem

1288
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,000
[Music]

1289
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,720
thank you for for that uh notes and um

1290
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,200
also quite curious to see

1291
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,880
you know how that how the growth

1292
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,119
strategy not just of big tech but also

1293
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,119
financial markets like

1294
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,920
uh growing to to web 3 or promoting

1295
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,560
crypto and nfts you know

1296
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,839
how would that

1297
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,839
impact our capacity in europe to react

1298
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,720
to that we will also try to you know

1299
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,880
jump on the wagon and and follow that

1300
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,760
race or you know i think our discussions

1301
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,839
on the visions of of technology on the

1302
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,560
planet on people and democracy is quite

1303
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,800
important so i want you to actually give

1304
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,400
you the opportunity to close with that

1305
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,359
right

1306
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,200
in this complex

1307
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,160
geopolitical and economic environment

1308
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,319
and context what are the political

1309
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,240
choices that we face

1310
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,400
um as as european citizens as activists

1311
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,800
and also for our institutions you touch

1312
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,839
upon some like the funding and our

1313
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,560
infrastructure choices uh

1314
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
free and open software

1315
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,440
um

1316
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
what are what is what is your take in

1317
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,079
recommendation um

1318
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,839
maybe starting with frank

1319
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,160
sure thanks a lot um i mean most of the

1320
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,400
topics are already mentioned here

1321
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,040
um there's one more thing which was only

1322
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,280
briefly mentioned is the anti-trump

1323
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,079
i want to

1324
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,359
put some light on that

1325
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,240
topic

1326
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,520
but this is not the only one there are

1327
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,559
lots of actions that are needed but

1328
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,119
and they try something which i think

1329
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,880
governments where

1330
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,760
and this is the case and europe are

1331
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,160
too weak in my opinion

1332
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,200
it's clear that we have a concentration

1333
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,240
of power

1334
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,680
in big tech

1335
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,520
and

1336
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,839
there are serious anti-trust

1337
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,680
violations happening it's just the

1338
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
governments are too slow and too weak

1339
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,040
and this needs to change

1340
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,960
and one example is

1341
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,359
the um there are just complaints that we

1342
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,400
from like

1343
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,760
from next clouds it's a bit against

1344
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,559
microsoft lately end of last year

1345
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,880
we submitted a year ago but in last year

1346
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,079
we

1347
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,319
went public with that um

1348
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,559
which is about like using one monopoly

1349
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,520
position to gain an advantage in another

1350
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,400
one

1351
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
um it's uh it's

1352
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,040
it's clear it's also

1353
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,119
communicated by the european union that

1354
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,119
microsoft has a monopoly on the

1355
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,280
operating system on a desktop

1356
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,520
pc operating system market

1357
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,760
and they use that to gain

1358
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,200
control

1359
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,599
to become the leader in another area

1360
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,640
which is

1361
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,640
cloud collaboration

1362
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,040
space they're bundling one drive

1363
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,079
directly into windows windows 11 now has

1364
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,640
teams button directly in the taskbar

1365
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,160
there are lots a lot of integration so

1366
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,480
they're basically using um one power

1367
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,319
position to get into the next one the

1368
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,640
next one next one this is like

1369
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,359
this is like uh monopoly behavior

1370
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,920
behavior that needs to be um this needs

1371
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,040
to be

1372
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,839
that by by the government i really wish

1373
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,880
um

1374
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,880
governments would

1375
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,640
like

1376
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,920
their

1377
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,800
power

1378
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,400
and

1379
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,720
volatile responsibilities to go against

1380
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,520
this behavior

1381
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,200
thank you

1382
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,680
esther

1383
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,559
um i would

1384
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,960
just want the um

1385
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,200
the proposal made by said of reclaiming

1386
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,839
our institution i think in large sense

1387
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,839
of institution this should be

1388
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,240
what drives our approach in europe our

1389
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,720
strategy of making sure social

1390
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
institutions remain

1391
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,800
at the service of people for people and

1392
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,720
thought in a way that they serve them

1393
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,240
the best and

1394
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,800
and to do that this is where i add my my

1395
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,760
own component to it is that i do think

1396
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,280
europe is

1397
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
still good at understanding some of the

1398
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,960
challenges and the issue and how people

1399
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,280
are being impacted by by certain

1400
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,880
ecosystem at the moment and the way they

1401
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,960
don't necessarily function

1402
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,359
and so even though in narrative and some

1403
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,000
framing and we may be

1404
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,920
maybe falling in the trap of trying to

1405
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,599
follow other instead of doing our own

1406
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,359
paths but we're still putting forward

1407
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,880
legislations

1408
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,839
and changes that can be quite promising

1409
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,400
but we usually fall through completely

1410
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,400
on how to enforce them and this is where

1411
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,559
also we need to acknowledge the you know

1412
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,760
there is a lot of conversation in

1413
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
brussels about the lobby power of

1414
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,319
dictate around legislation being adopted

1415
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,839
this lobby party doesn't stop when the

1416
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,680
law is adopted you know this is one of

1417
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,040
the reasons why there's so many

1418
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,000
difficulties also in implementing gdpr

1419
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,599
a lot of cases are being appealed for

1420
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,440
years on procedure runs on everything

1421
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,200
you can throw because they have the mean

1422
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,720
those companies have the means to just

1423
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,440
make

1424
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,280
cases going on and on and on and drag

1425
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
forever and so we don't feel the reality

1426
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
of those legislative and good political

1427
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,000
changes and so it's to

1428
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,079
give a message maybe for the eu of like

1429
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,920
at some point we'll have to stop

1430
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,440
creating new laws we'll have good

1431
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,040
structure but we'll have to put all of

1432
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,200
the energies on making them a reality

1433
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,359
and then forcing them and so that's why

1434
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,520
the action also many members like now

1435
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,440
than others and making those legislation

1436
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,160
a reality will be so important and just

1437
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,760
a cautionary tell for us to know that

1438
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,520
you know lobbying exists at all of those

1439
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,760
levels and making making a legislation

1440
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
isn't in fact just

1441
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,079
one step even though that sometimes

1442
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,960
takes five to seven years but um the

1443
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,720
it's really part i think of the

1444
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,480
reclaiming the institution and making

1445
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,520
sure

1446
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,359
the the progress

1447
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,760
are delivered in a way that can serve

1448
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,720
people the best way

1449
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,160
thank you for the reminder and for

1450
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,240
championing gdpr

1451
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,800
enforcement uh together with our other

1452
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,240
edger members

1453
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,200
um say that what is what is your

1454
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,440
ending note on

1455
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,720
our political

1456
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,640
and social choices

1457
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,280
yeah um i think there's kind of like a

1458
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,200
double strategy i think we have to

1459
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,800
tackle the

1460
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,880
the dominance of big tech

1461
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,839
and and also think about other practices

1462
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,480
at the same time um including in the way

1463
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,720
we reclaim institutions so i just put a

1464
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,960
quote from the technological sovereignty

1465
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,760
um

1466
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,520
project that was pulled together by a

1467
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,359
bunch of people also at kalafoo and

1468
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,680
activists um who are doing some work

1469
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,599
also for example 5g right now in

1470
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
amsterdam and you know like people are

1471
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
just trying to think of different ways

1472
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,880
of doing technology and i think doing

1473
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,280
that different way of technology is

1474
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,960
really thinking hard from the problems

1475
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,480
that we're facing today and thinking

1476
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,079
about technology that addresses those

1477
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,000
instead of perpetuates

1478
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,520
viktek's

1479
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,440
technological practices but in a

1480
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,119
european context

1481
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,200
um so i think that you know we see this

1482
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,520
in you know moxie marlon spike um who's

1483
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,880
you know one of the main developers of

1484
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,000
signal wrote a web 3.0 post and he's

1485
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,280
like this is going to be an alternative

1486
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,400
but we're going to make it agile on

1487
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,240
microservices and going to update new

1488
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,920
features all the time and you're like

1489
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,920
okay you're so confused we can't help

1490
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,640
you um so i think um you know frank's

1491
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,319
initiative here in nexcloud is kind of

1492
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,119
interesting um in terms of institutions

1493
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,880
and organizations at least taking a

1494
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,720
pause before they jump into um you know

1495
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,960
the cloud infrastructures and mobile

1496
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,040
devices as their accessories i think

1497
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,720
that kind of daily practice is really

1498
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,640
important but we can't just be like we

1499
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,720
used open source therefore we're fine

1500
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,160
and i know it's very difficult to even

1501
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,000
get that going but we need to have a

1502
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,160
vision as to what is the future life

1503
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,040
form we want to have and i think the the

1504
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,800
little quote i have from the

1505
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,680
technological sovereignty

1506
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,640
initiative

1507
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,240
is very interesting it says if our

1508
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,079
desire is to bring about social change

1509
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,760
towards a more sustainable collective

1510
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,240
and commun communal society we must

1511
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,640
change the means the resources and the

1512
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,319
relationships that currently sustain

1513
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,040
society based on economic interests and

1514
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,520
i hope we can go in that direction

1515
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,119
um in the future thanks

1516
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,119

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,839
a little late on the european side but

1532
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,359
they're having a conversation more on

1533
