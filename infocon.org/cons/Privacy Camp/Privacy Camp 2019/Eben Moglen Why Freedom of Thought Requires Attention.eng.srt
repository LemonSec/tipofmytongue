00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
a

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
[Music]

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:33,590
good afternoon it's a pleasure and an

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:38,650
honor to be back at república seven

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:43,040
years ago I came here to talk about how

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:47,210
freedom of thought requires media that

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:52,690
don't listen to and watch and surveil us

10
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:56,690
as we use them and why media that

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,019
consumes us in the end consumes freedom

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:02,750
of thought three years ago

13
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:05,899
Misha Qadri and I came here to talk

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:10,429
about the last kilometer of the net the

15
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:13,750
part that is closest to you which had

16
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:19,970
become the behavior collection system

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:24,530
embracing humanity and began the process

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:29,990
of making surveillance and autocracy

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:34,970
perfect now we are approaching the end

20
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:38,798
of the most fateful decade for the human

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,270
mind since the French Revolution and

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,600
everybody is beginning to notice

23
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,500
something and our theme this year for

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:54,429
all of us is what is happening to the

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:58,399
nature of the human mind we built a new

26
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,850
neuroanatomy for the human race one

27
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,020
which provides an exoskeleton nervous

28
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:09,350
system for all the billions of us begins

29
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:14,150
the process of turning us all of

30
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:17,780
humanity into a super organism a process

31
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,760
that many of us old enough to have been

32
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,600
around at the beginning of all of this

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,820
welcomed for the possibility of the

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,920
liberation of the human mind that it

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,100
presented

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,450
every human brain learning everything

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:41,049
that it wants to learn without being

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:43,730
constrained by cost or power a

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:47,500
revolution which we sought to bring

40
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:51,049
about with free software with

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,410
inexpensive hardware with the bandwidth

42
00:02:51,050 --> 00:03:00,020
that could allow every brain on earth to

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:04,400
learn and we have been for the last

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:08,000
decade coping with the horrid unexpected

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,980
or at least unintended consequences of

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,590
that revolution so we built this network

47
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,399
that embraces every human mind within

48
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,500
another generation every brain of every

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,340
human being on earth will be formed

50
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:30,019
directly in connection with the net from

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:33,010
birth onward every human mind will

52
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,769
develop in the context of all the other

53
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,798
human minds connected to the net and all

54
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:43,790
those non human agents beginning to

55
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:51,530
develop inside that nervous system we

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:56,120
are building but we turned our net dark

57
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,450
on ourselves when it came time to

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:05,230
articulate the physiology that that

59
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:08,390
Anatomy makes possible so we wired up

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,640
everything so that every human brain

61
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:20,469
could access everything but we built

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,469
media that consumed us as we consumed it

63
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:30,549
my friends in the Soviet Union when

64
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:35,169
there was a Soviet Union knew as they

65
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:39,400
used to say that the only free cheese is

66
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,799
in a mousetrap which proves of course

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,049
that the Union of Soviet Socialist

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,780
Republics was not a bad place to learn

69
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:50,470
the fundamentals of surveillance

70
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,710
capitalism that's what we did right we

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:05:01,050
we turned the network backwards on

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:05,400
itself so that the services first

73
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:09,400
telecommunications storage time

74
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,099
management search etc etc all the

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,530
services became the cheese on the stage

76
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:22,210
of the mousetrap offered for free in

77
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:27,280
return for information about each human

78
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:33,010
being in real time and the opportunity

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,280
to push the neuron at the end of the

80
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:42,610
network the one closest to you most of

81
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:47,320
the time is a spy satellite the densest

82
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,070
collection of sensors gram for gram ever

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,969
engineered by human beings

84
00:05:50,070 --> 00:06:00,699
we've stuff in orbit that's pretty dense

85
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,130
with sensors the Americans used to brag

86
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,169
during the Cold War that we had things

87
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,000
in orbit that could take a picture of a

88
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:13,719
golf ball on the surface of the earth

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,960
but gram for gram that thing you're

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,360
taught to call a smartphone it's smart

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,820
and it's just a phone so don't be afraid

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,490
of it

93
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:27,669
gram for gram that smartphone is denser

94
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:32,150
with sensing than the spy satellite in

95
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:35,880
orbit and it's all aimed at you

96
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:39,479
that's the neuron closest to you in the

97
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,840
net most of the time it's very cheap to

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,000
take pictures of golf balls now we don't

99
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,169
need to put a thing in orbit to take a

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,820
picture of a golf ball on the ground

101
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,150
everybody has a little camera and they

102
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,680
take a picture of their own golf ball

103
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:58,349
and they put in the net and we have it

104
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,240
instantly that network equipped to sense

105
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,470
the human being at its end more

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,140
completely than anything else carrying a

107
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,150
battery that gram for gram stores more

108
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,800
power than a nuclear power plant because

109
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,659
of course you need a lot of energy for

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:20,280
all those sensors that neuron creates a

111
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,300
network whose purpose now is to acquire

112
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:29,880
your behavior as much of it as possible

113
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:37,140
and to offer you services that justify

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:40,980
the degree of information you are giving

115
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:44,370
up in return for the services you are

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,580
receiving pretty amazing services if you

117
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,850
consider email and calendaring and you

118
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,729
know stuff that any little box can do to

119
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,830
be amazing services what is really

120
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,040
amazing is the price at which they are

121
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,580
delivered to you which isn't zero it's

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,110
the cost of who you are the surrender

123
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,260
not just of what you know about yourself

124
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:15,450
but all that can be inferred from your

125
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:20,370
behavior sense all the time and then the

126
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:25,110
opportunity to push back at you the

127
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,050
computers that we use now push us very

128
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,360
hard

129
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,279
tens of thousands of times a day they

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,769
show an advertisement and measure a

131
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:40,320
response thousands of times a day in one

132
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:42,779
study more than 2,000 of young people in

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,970
the United States the the phone gets

134
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,510
physically interacted with more than

135
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,720
2,000 times a day in the past history of

136
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,089
the human race if they were a thing in

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,450
your pocket that you touched thousands

138
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:59,220
of times a day it would be assumed to be

139
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:06,149
the result of obsessive compulsive

140
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:10,170
disorder now it's normal this is the

141
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:13,260
network within which in one generation

142
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:20,699
every human mind will be formed from

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:26,490
birth physiologically this is not good

144
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:30,449
for human beings intellectually this is

145
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:35,579
not good for the human race economically

146
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:39,060
it makes a ton of money Shoshanna Zubov

147
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:41,550
in her masterpiece last year the age of

148
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,969
surveillance capitalism offered an

149
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:50,819
account of the political economy that

150
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:56,279
now drives this network the structure of

151
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:59,399
selling human attention by rapid but I

152
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:03,660
mean really rapid auctions conducted

153
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:09,980
trillions of times a day to reach

154
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:12,779
billions of people to make them behave

155
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,290
it's very important to recognize that

156
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,829
once behavior collection is what the

157
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:25,680
network really does then what it

158
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:28,859
attempts to maximize is behavior this

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,239
lies beneath the increasingly important

160
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,930
intellectual discipline referred to as

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:41,279
persuasive design that is the design of

162
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:48,569
hardware and software to cause you

163
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:51,880
to persuade you actually to a dict you

164
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:57,839
to registering your behavior through the

165
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,839
sensing system clicking swiping moving

166
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:08,920
behavior is what the network now

167
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:15,069
metabolizes it eats yours and it lives

168
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:19,180
off that behavior that it acquires it

169
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:24,100
emits stimuli designed to cause more

170
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:27,219
behavior persuasive design we may say is

171
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,670
a bunch of geeks doing with math and

172
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:37,420
science what Steven P Jobs did by art

173
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:40,300
persuade you to hold it to touch it to

174
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,599
interact with it to sense your wishes

175
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,270
and your needs in it to deliver your

176
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,880
anxieties to it this is what we mean

177
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,880
when we say it's so convenient

178
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:59,190
that's the physiology of the network now

179
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:03,910
it metabolizes behavior and it emits

180
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:09,640
stimuli for new behavior it is in that

181
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:14,709
sense parasitic it lives off us it makes

182
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:17,890
a good living but it also carries the

183
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,579
knowledge of all that human behavior

184
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,579
acquired

185
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,360
it has a view of the nature of human

186
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:32,569
existence which is very special

187
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,750
embracing both the most specific

188
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:41,130
possible awareness of your life how you

189
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:44,310
feel how you act what you do how fast

190
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,500
you move what you're looking at what

191
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,599
you're thinking about at least so far as

192
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,580
the search box and you're swiping

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,670
behavior can tell them at the same time

194
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,880
that the network contains a synoptic

195
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:06,000
view of human behavior billions of

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:09,120
people all behaving all adding up their

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,020
behavior to everybody else's behavior to

198
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,270
offer a picture to the Machine of the

199
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:21,800
large-scale structure of human activity

200
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:26,850
from the very smallest your momentary

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:29,939
reflexes your momentary movements of

202
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,520
attention to the very largest questions

203
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,820
how do humans behave what are the

204
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:39,660
patterns we can find there how can we

205
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,120
recognize that is after all what we call

206
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,939
machine learning now recognition of

207
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,220
patterns how can we recognize the

208
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,100
patterns of human behavior on the

209
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,980
largest scale from the smallest to the

210
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,140
largest from that which is precisely

211
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,980
descriptive of you to that which is

212
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,949
imminent to being human all collected

213
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,460
all the time nothing ever lost or

214
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,250
forgotten in the whole long history of

215
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,100
the human race we've had really only one

216
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,280
way of describing that view from every

217
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,590
Sparrow falling to the destiny of the

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,020
world we called it when we thought of it

219
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,020
at all we called it the mind of God

220
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,910
and so what have we now what have we

221
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,860
wrought what is this network in which we

222
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:36,719
are now wrapped everywhere all the time

223
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:43,889
the bad news is it's the parasite with

224
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:49,139
the mind of God so who are we what is

225
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:56,300
our relationship to this network now we

226
00:14:49,139 --> 00:15:01,499
behave for it what the network needs

227
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:06,059
what it takes from us what it drinks its

228
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:13,459
sustenance is our behavior and it makes

229
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:13,459
more of it the human attention system

230
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:28,290
the quality of our distinctively human

231
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:31,290
lines that ability to focus and to think

232
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:37,399
about something to hold it in a mental

233
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:42,379
space of our own is where the network

234
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,379
chemically alters who we are

235
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:56,879
the ability to pay attention is a thing

236
00:15:48,179 --> 00:16:00,119
we learn partially in utero partially as

237
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:03,679
a descent from those who came before us

238
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:10,319
but in every human organism a learned

239
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:13,228
acquired skill those who work on

240
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:16,108
understanding the psychology of human

241
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:19,559
infants can point to the ways in which

242
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:24,239
the attachment between the caretaking

243
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:29,969
adult human and the infant generates the

244
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:37,409
nature of attention but the machines

245
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:44,009
view of our attention well it's a raw

246
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:49,949
material a resource for extraction all

247
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:53,909
those artifacts sensing you stimulating

248
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:57,829
you producing behaviors so they can

249
00:16:53,909 --> 00:17:03,899
acquire the behavior thus produced

250
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:06,480
conscript attention we build the things

251
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,409
so that they are good at conscripting

252
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,949
your attention

253
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:18,240
they make attractive noises they vibrate

254
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:22,919
in fulfilling fashion they interrupt the

255
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,000
stream of internal life in order to

256
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,250
deliver now this very important message

257
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,549
about the job your friend just got or

258
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,889
the vacation your pal just took or

259
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:37,289
here's an advertisement do you want to

260
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:41,850
click on this but after all of course

261
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:46,340
the stream stream it's the right word

262
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:49,408
it's it's continuing undestructible

263
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,678
interrupted natural as water falling

264
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:54,330
down the side of the hill stream of what

265
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:59,280
comes to you

266
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:05,560
drowns the inner dialogue removes

267
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:10,360
interior T changes your understanding of

268
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:14,050
time to long didn't read how long is too

269
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:20,139
long as long

270
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:23,770
for example as Tolstoy Zarate Mir in the

271
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:27,370
20th century at the end of the 20th

272
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:31,750
century was the Golden Age of reading it

273
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:37,300
turns out access to almost everything

274
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:41,830
and the mental facility to hold all that

275
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:45,340
reading too long didn't read Warren PC I

276
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,949
can believe that but when I was a

277
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,209
college senior in a half-year modern

278
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:54,070
complete course we read Moby Dick and

279
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,440
Boren piece and Anna Karenina and

280
00:18:54,070 --> 00:19:03,879
Ulysses and a hundred years of solitude

281
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:05,560
in fourteen weeks we did because we

282
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,930
could we did because we were trained

283
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,330
because we were lucky because we were

284
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,120
privileged people in a world which

285
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,260
allowed us to develop our minds that way

286
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,290
but also though we didn't know it we

287
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,390
couldn't have conceived it even though I

288
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,370
was then developing programming

289
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,160
languages at IBM and I thought I knew a

290
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,979
bunch about technology we couldn't have

291
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:36,940
foreseen that the people who came after

292
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:41,620
us would be crippled in acquiring that

293
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:47,170
ability by the incessant disturbance of

294
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:50,790
the machines seeking attention what is

295
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,520
happening to our attention span is a

296
00:19:50,790 --> 00:20:00,129
scientific object of study last month in

297
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:05,910
Nature communications for authors led by

298
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:08,740
philip lawrence bank document by

299
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,560
multiple longitudinal studies of

300
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,290
everything from movie ticket sales and

301
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,020
book publications to twitter handle's

302
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,889
and to twitter hashtags and google

303
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:26,860
searches the extent of the shortening of

304
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:31,560
attention span over time decades the

305
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:35,379
dynamic acceleration of the process of

306
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,200
competition for attention accompanied by

307
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,940
a simple mathematical model of the

308
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:47,920
nature of that dynamic shortening of

309
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:50,980
attention we can measure the extent to

310
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,880
which we are fracturing the coherence of

311
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,880
the human mind

312
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:03,490
and we can feel it when we watch our own

313
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,580
interactions with the people and the

314
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:13,419
network around us I admit to being

315
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:17,590
excessively old-fashioned I run a lot of

316
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:20,230
servers 14 of them I have a lot of

317
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:23,590
endpoint stuff around me

318
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,830
sink pads Chromebooks without Chrome on

319
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:31,418
and all sorts of similar things and

320
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:35,939
never never never never at all ever do I

321
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:35,940
see an advertisement on a computer

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,870
that's the way I run my stuff right

323
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,780
because I can't help it because I

324
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:49,959
started using computers when I was 12 in

325
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,799
1971 and the gravitational consequence

326
00:21:49,960 --> 00:22:00,030
of having grown up computing without

327
00:21:52,799 --> 00:22:03,789
disturbance leaves me hyper sensitive to

328
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:06,490
efforts to control my thinking from yet

329
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:12,879
another message from yet another friend

330
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:15,400
or a friend or friend so I'm speaking

331
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,340
out of a condition of ignorance and

332
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:23,280
helplessness with respect to how you all

333
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:28,830
manage this I don't know how you can

334
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:32,260
it's a triumph an extraordinary victory

335
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:36,280
that you retained the ability to think

336
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:38,799
despite all that disturbance if your

337
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,220
sleep were as disturbed as your waking

338
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:45,280
life it would be sleep deprivation

339
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,020
torture and you would die you wake

340
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,860
somebody up several hundred times a

341
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,520
night to tell them something you're

342
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,059
hurting them

343
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,710
everybody knows that because the

344
00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,950
physiological relationship to sleep is

345
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,740
so demanding but something bad is

346
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:09,710
happening to you when the lights are on

347
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:11,929
- and you triumph over it because you

348
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,020
were people who were born on the cusp of

349
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,800
this and your habits though they may not

350
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,840
be as hyper retrograde as mine are still

351
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,760
the habits of people whose minds were

352
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,428
formed not in relation to the net you

353
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,240
still maintain a sense of the purpose of

354
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:35,120
human thought which assumes that your

355
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:40,610
thinking is for some purpose other than

356
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,649
the creation of measurable behavior but

357
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:48,260
pretty soon you're going to be

358
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:52,700
outnumbered because that's not what it

359
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:57,250
feels like to be an infant connected to

360
00:23:52,700 --> 00:24:00,410
this net from the beginning of life I

361
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,570
have a street photography project in New

362
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:07,730
York that I call the 21st century

363
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:10,700
Madonna on the street I photograph

364
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:14,960
people carrying an infant in a front

365
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:18,590
carrier and the adult is looking here

366
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:23,170
and the infant is looking at the adult

367
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,169
looking at the phone

368
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:30,669
that's the birth of a new cultural

369
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:37,960
system in the human race spreading

370
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:41,500
faster than Christianity or Islam or any

371
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:44,890
other fast-moving cultural innovation in

372
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:49,120
the history of humankind changing who we

373
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:52,900
are by changing the purpose of our

374
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:58,270
thinking you may notice there are also

375
00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:02,110
some consequences for politics that is

376
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:06,220
to say we are experiencing a decline in

377
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,770
public rationality we are experiencing

378
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:12,090
it not merely in one society or another

379
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:16,210
we have not merely Trump or also brexit

380
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:21,850
we are experiencing an attack upon our

381
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:25,050
own ability to deliberate it's hard it

382
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:28,350
is when we increase the flow of

383
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,480
information when we maximize the

384
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:34,330
accessibility of everything the problem

385
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,790
of ascertaining truths becomes harder

386
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,399
there's more to sort through this is

387
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,770
correct

388
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,280
but the most important change is not the

389
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:48,490
volume of the material requiring

390
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:52,930
analysis it's the time in which analysis

391
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:57,610
needs to occur the space in which it

392
00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:01,200
happens in the European world we came to

393
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:04,389
our interior T through the Reformation

394
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,450
we came to the nature of how we

395
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,450
understood our inner lives through a

396
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:13,360
change in the religious ideology of the

397
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:19,030
societies of the north of the European

398
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:23,040
Peninsula the ones where the word where

399
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:26,649
literacy driving religious contemplation

400
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:31,889
privileged the individual over all other

401
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,890
low sigh of power and society

402
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:41,269
literacy drove internality and

403
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:44,139
internality drove democracy the sense of

404
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:48,950
the individual as the unit of

405
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:52,729
decision-making we are now terrified of

406
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,309
algorithms and we are justifiably

407
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:58,669
spending a fair amount of time on the

408
00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:01,190
social consequences of this or that way

409
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:06,950
of automating decision-making in

410
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:11,320
organizations we are ironically less

411
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:17,740
concerned about the consequences of non

412
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:21,620
algorithmic thinking impulsive thinking

413
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:25,129
merely responsive thinking in the

414
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,418
individual human brain increasingly

415
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:32,418
given over to activity of swiping and

416
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:35,240
clicking and watching random pieces of

417
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:38,779
the passing show go by through the

418
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,779
status updates and Instagram commentary

419
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:48,889
and all the other pieces of what we are

420
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:54,470
pleased to call social media and what is

421
00:27:48,889 --> 00:28:01,699
decaying is that private internal space

422
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:05,570
in which truth is sorted out and the

423
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,539
human being decides for herself what is

424
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,168
the purpose of the world what is the

425
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:19,220
meaning of my existence here how should

426
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:22,059
I live not surprisingly the machine is

427
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:25,940
not interested in how you should live

428
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:30,918
its interested only in how much you

429
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:34,299
behave political dialogue becomes about

430
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,299
striking poses

431
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:46,270
much less about considering let alone

432
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:49,659
reconsidering taking something into an

433
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:55,150
internal space of your own and thinking

434
00:28:49,660 --> 00:29:00,100
about it over time you do win a daily

435
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:03,040
victory you still achieve that against

436
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:07,439
the enormous pressure of the devices you

437
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,440
keep around you and the way they work

438
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:16,090
but you cannot keep it up forever or

439
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,090
rather like me you can insist upon

440
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,919
holding a particular technological

441
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:26,310
relationship to the machine you can

442
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,310
preserve some mental space of your own

443
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:37,080
but how do you allow the generation

444
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,080
coming to behind yours to inherit that

445
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:43,810
so here is our problem the attention

446
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,460
span of the human race collectively is

447
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:52,389
shortening the precious autonomy of

448
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,870
internal mind that we gained barely half

449
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,140
a thousand years ago and which we used

450
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:01,709
to make democracy and the right of the

451
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,750
individual and the sense of

452
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:10,330
self-development intellectual and social

453
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:15,310
which we call freedom is threatened by

454
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:19,030
our own habits as they take hold in this

455
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:23,820
net we do not want with these media that

456
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,820
consume us as we consume them

457
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:31,550
like the carbon dioxide in the

458
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:38,280
atmosphere this is a colorless odorless

459
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:40,830
tasteless change and understanding the

460
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:45,629
second-order consequences of this

461
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:51,419
pollution we are polluting our inner

462
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:54,800
self with is tricky complicated business

463
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:58,170
it requires systemic thinking not

464
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:03,540
overreaction not panic not a sense of

465
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:07,890
revulsion or disgust not an anti

466
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,710
modernist reaction not break all the

467
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:16,380
machines destroy the network we built

468
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:19,440
this to liberate humankind we can't just

469
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,470
take it apart and destroy it

470
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,740
because we have allowed it to twist in

471
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:30,870
our hands and bite us back we have to

472
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:34,140
fix it we have a fairly short period of

473
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,360
time we wasted I don't mean the people

474
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,220
in this room we are the people who have

475
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,429
been worried about this all the way long

476
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,700
but we collectively have wasted crucial

477
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,700
time

478
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:54,090
and the clock now runs against us as it

479
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:57,490
runs against us on the planet to great

480
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:00,730
environmental disasters each requiring

481
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:05,550
our fullest concentration and our

482
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:08,940
broadest social mobilizations we're busy

483
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:12,250
we're following one another's feeds

484
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,280
we're having trouble concentrating on

485
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:19,050
the main events we're not so easily able

486
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:25,270
to keep our eyes on the prize

487
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:27,310
too long didn't read I mean John Locke's

488
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:31,629
essay on human understanding for example

489
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:35,740
much too long didn't read that's copy

490
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:42,190
Tom way too long even in the 20th

491
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:46,000
century it was long but we need them we

492
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:48,540
need all that accumulated rumination we

493
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,730
called civilization once upon a time

494
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:56,940
when we weren't displacing it with well

495
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:04,900
the chemistry of the machine-man

496
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:06,610
relationship so Oh we'd better do

497
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,230
something about this time is growing

498
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:16,000
very short in fact I wouldn't really

499
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:17,620
come and seven years in bother you again

500
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,720
about this if I didn't think it could be

501
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:26,129
fixed but remember that those of us

502
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,690
whose minds were formed outside the

503
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:34,360
context of the net have got to do it

504
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:36,670
it's much much harder to get out than it

505
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,209
is never to have gotten in in the first

506
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,330
place

507
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:44,740
my poor students in law school who want

508
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:47,620
privacy but everything they've got

509
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,990
around them is built against it it's

510
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,760
easy for me simply to refuse I don't

511
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:56,929
have a Google account sorry

512
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:59,210
but what do you do when your life was

513
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,070
given away at the beginning your parents

514
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,510
put you on the services you've lived

515
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,240
your entire lives with them you wouldn't

516
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:14,449
know how to have a calendar on the side

517
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:18,109
of a refrigerator anymore so we those of

518
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:20,928
us in that women'll period as the nature

519
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,810
of human thought was changing as the

520
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,929
purpose of ideas went from being

521
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,418
constructed inward to signaling outward

522
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,240
those of us who live here now we have to

523
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:35,330
deal with this we can't leave this for

524
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:38,658
the future not yet are the young

525
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:42,739
blocking the bridges on us to force us

526
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,050
to deal with this not yet which means we

527
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:50,209
better do it now before it gets that bad

528
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:53,899
what must we do we need to change the

529
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,668
political economy of services the people

530
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,680
in this room are the producers of the

531
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,569
political economy of service is not the

532
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,970
beneficiaries I don't mean that you're

533
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,750
all the shareholders of it but you know

534
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:10,009
how it's made you ran the pipes as I did

535
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:13,880
to once upon a time we need to make it

536
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:17,990
possible to federate all services in the

537
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,470
net why is such a technical goal so

538
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:23,479
terribly important because when services

539
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,029
are federated they are no longer paid

540
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,280
for by exclusive access to the internal

541
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,650
lives of human beings and they are no

542
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,190
longer justified by the profitability of

543
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:36,770
advertising sales when we are taking in

544
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:39,980
one another's washing when our messaging

545
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,560
and our calendaring and our storage and

546
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,330
all those other piddling commodity

547
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,540
services that we use when we are

548
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,430
delivering them to one another

549
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,100
cooperatively we are turning the net

550
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,980
back in the direction that we originally

551
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:59,660
wanted the one in which it acts to

552
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:01,989
liberate us through individual effort to

553
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:06,549
teach and learn

554
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:09,469
the Federation of all services is not an

555
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:11,779
inconceivable idea most of the services

556
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:13,609
we have were meant to be federated then

557
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:16,339
that was designed for it

558
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:21,910
we are undoing problems rather than

559
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:21,910
making terribly complicated inventions

560
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,269
this is the intended goal of the little

561
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:33,279
gesture I call freedom box the

562
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:35,930
manufacturer of simple inexpensive self

563
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:38,420
administrating servers that we can hold

564
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:40,609
in the palm of our hand and distribute

565
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:47,239
throughout the world like Appleseed's

566
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:48,979
a great intercontinental activity the

567
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,200
software for freedom box is made

568
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:53,960
everywhere from Hyderabad to Seattle and

569
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,410
the current versions of the boxes are

570
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,380
manufactured in Bulgaria because of

571
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:03,950
course we do have the value of the net

572
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,619
to make our free software in to spread

573
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:09,468
our inexpensive hardware over the world

574
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:13,809
to do all the things we need in order to

575
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:17,930
make this neuroanatomy payoff not by

576
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:20,660
centralization but by diffusion which

577
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:23,180
brings with it naturally the goal of

578
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,239
intellectual self development at those

579
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,779
human endpoints that we were seeking in

580
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:32,259
the first place we need to understand

581
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:35,170
that the businesses we have called

582
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:38,660
telecommunications and social media or

583
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,989
behavior collection businesses we need

584
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:46,069
to regulate them not as telecoms or

585
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:48,109
platforms but as behavior collectors we

586
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:50,869
need to understand the business of

587
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:54,200
behavior collection like the business of

588
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:58,009
coal mining or steel production as a

589
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,288
business subject to regulation in the

590
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:02,839
public interest on the basis of what it

591
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:05,359
is not what he claims to be not what it

592
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,089
hopes to be not what it says on the

593
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,549
shareholders pamphlets than it is but

594
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:13,400
what it does to society which is what

595
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:14,240
regulation is about what happens to

596
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,240
society

597
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,089
gdpr is the beginning of an effort to

598
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,390
think about the regulation of behavior

599
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:26,960
collection but it still depends upon the

600
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:29,270
idea of consent by individuals to the

601
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,990
collection of behavior as the relevant

602
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:36,920
category for the legal administration of

603
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:39,189
this business consent is not the heart

604
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,390
of behavior collection it's an

605
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,940
environmental subject

606
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,000
everybody's actions affect everybody

607
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:50,599
else's actions therefore individual

608
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,960
consent should not be the test what are

609
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,390
the rights what are the standards what

610
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,910
are the social objectives within which

611
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:04,848
behavior collection can be not just

612
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:08,240
allowed but accepted we need to

613
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:14,089
appreciate that the goal of the network

614
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:17,660
is not the constant subsidiary mental

615
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:22,369
activity of human beings the goal of the

616
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:25,339
network is not push its poll that is to

617
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:29,540
say all of the effort to make the

618
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:33,589
network operate on Internet time is a

619
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:36,640
form of pollution what we really wanted

620
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:39,740
was for human beings to initiate

621
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,250
requests for what they want what they

622
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:48,830
need what they wish for what they think

623
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:53,780
and what they learn this was the subject

624
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:56,779
of our effort in making the net and the

625
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,820
free software that now runs it in the

626
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:03,980
first place

627
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:07,940
to give users rights but also to

628
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:11,119
encourage presumption to encourage those

629
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,140
who use to scratch an itch to learn how

630
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,480
to make to become better makers

631
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:20,598
ultimately to serve others needs as well

632
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:24,470
as their own by cooperating in learning

633
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,860
and making knowledge we need to

634
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:31,750
understand that as a concrete

635
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:35,110
explicit social goal the jangling in the

636
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:39,720
net like the noise in the street may be

637
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:43,000
a collateral consequence of what we do

638
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,819
we had a transportation revolution too

639
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,210
in fact in the last 200 years they're

640
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,130
very noisy the world was quieter when it

641
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:55,240
had only horses in it but we live with

642
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:58,660
the noise for a good reason it is not

643
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:02,049
clear what the objective of social

644
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:04,000
regulation of the net ought to be unless

645
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:08,320
it is the improvement of human

646
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,430
intellectual life the broadening to be

647
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:16,390
sure the maximizing of access but

648
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:18,190
quality is important too we are not just

649
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,140
seeking to increase the quantity of

650
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,720
human thought although that is where the

651
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,259
great big social benefits are in the

652
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,009
extrication of ignorance but we are also

653
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:34,300
still trying to improve how we think as

654
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:38,290
well as how much and it should be the

655
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:44,080
clear goal of social policy to help us

656
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:48,250
make the net quieter our politics

657
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:50,710
depends upon it I need not say the

658
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,240
health of our democracies depends upon

659
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:58,020
it the nature of our educational process

660
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:04,950
depends upon it the freedom of our

661
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:09,250
grandchildren depends upon it too long

662
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:13,169
didn't read is the crisis of the human

663
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,170
mind in five characters

664
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:24,330
it's good we got a clear understanding

665
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:28,410
of the problem but we need to summon

666
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:30,509
just enough longevity of thought to go

667
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:34,379
about the business of fixing it which

668
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:38,510
means technology politics and law driven

669
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:42,270
for the purpose of reanimating human

670
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:46,890
concentration reducing our attention

671
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:49,440
deficit disorder induced by the nature

672
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:52,980
of our market for services and the

673
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:58,410
character of the Machine we've built we

674
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:03,030
have to do that the rising sea level is

675
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:07,730
becoming evident to people to the point

676
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:13,290
at which denial has become well an

677
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:15,920
exercise in deception what is happening

678
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:22,529
to the human mind is not quite so

679
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:26,130
unambiguously clear just now most of the

680
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:32,100
human race is most aware of an increase

681
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:34,050
in access and convenience most of the

682
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,509
human race has always lived in a

683
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,090
condition of ignorance and cultural

684
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:43,110
deprivation because that's what we do to

685
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:45,420
the poor and as Aristotle noted the poor

686
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:52,170
are always many and the rich are always

687
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:56,970
few but though we have a clear

688
00:43:52,170 --> 00:44:01,650
understanding of how things work we us

689
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:04,859
in this room we are not yet capable of

690
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:07,980
explaining to most of humanity why the

691
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:10,020
benefits they are receiving are coming

692
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,610
at a very high and ultimately

693
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,610
unsustainable cost

694
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:23,480
for those who are hungry who yearned for

695
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:27,120
knowledge who yearned for the ability of

696
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,790
self-expression who yearn to reach out

697
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,670
and connect to other human beings and

698
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:36,810
teach and learn from them which is the

699
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:44,600
human way for those people who are

700
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:48,690
deprived free cheese is a good thing and

701
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:54,270
it's not their fault that we built the

702
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:57,680
mousetrap and we didn't tell them so we

703
00:44:54,270 --> 00:45:02,730
have an ethical obligation a moral

704
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:09,870
requirement we have to deal with this we

705
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:12,920
can we should human nature depends upon

706
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,920
us to get it right

707
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,350
time is running out thank you very much

708
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,459
thank you very much even Muslim

709
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,910
so I'm just standing here in the middle

710
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:43,529
of the stage so we have time for Q&A and

711
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,299
I will stand here so we can queue up for

712
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:48,869
queue neighs and I will hold the

713
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:51,119
microphone for you so yep do we have

714
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:52,950
time for your name yeah it looks perfect

715
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,869
so maybe you can introduce yourself and

716
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,609
ask your question sure hi even it's Cory

717
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:59,430
hi quick question

718
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:01,469
is it possible that the reason that we

719
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,569
get so much data harvested from us and

720
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:05,640
so many ads shown to us is because

721
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:07,380
mostly it doesn't work very well like

722
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,779
the only emotion they manage to events

723
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,249
from us as anxiety and constant checking

724
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:13,079
like no one's ever figured out how to

725
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:15,868
use Facebook to make you lose weight or

726
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,369
you know be happy or whatever maybe it's

727
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:18,719
just maybe they've got like a mind

728
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:20,459
control ray that can only do one thing

729
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,200
which is make you anxious which is just

730
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:25,859
the same as like you know a kid with a

731
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:29,848
kazoo well anxiety Cory is surely the

732
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:32,160
overall average of the emotional output

733
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:33,930
though I think it would be fair to say

734
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,089
that social media is a little better

735
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:40,098
designed than that I tell my students

736
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:44,969
that each of these objects has a keynote

737
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:48,569
emotion that of Facebook is Envy that of

738
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:51,690
Twitter is humiliation um there are a

739
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:53,099
series of emotional outcomes but the

740
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,779
important thing about them is they're

741
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:57,930
made to make you click and swipe that is

742
00:46:54,779 --> 00:47:00,869
to say whatever that emotion is that the

743
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:03,419
goal of the architecture physical and

744
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:06,599
software and all the rest is to reply

745
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,369
and reply that into the networks I'm in

746
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:11,160
trying to understand for two years what

747
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:12,719
the word convenience means because there

748
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,249
are so many things that so many people

749
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,199
around me find convenient that I

750
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:18,749
wouldn't be caught dead doing right and

751
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,999
and so I keep trying to figure out what

752
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:23,488
is this convenience of which you speak I

753
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:25,828
have come to the conclusion and here I

754
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:28,319
feel as though I am walking in baby

755
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:30,539
steps in the footsteps of the giant mr.

756
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,819
Jobs the king of the undead now dead who

757
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:35,069
saw it first I believe what we mean by

758
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,449
convenience is the surrender of an

759
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:43,589
anxiety to the network we hand an app of

760
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:45,480
something and it's taken so I think you

761
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:47,700
you were you know you

762
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,190
you were under estimating its quality it

763
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,799
creates anxiety and then conveniently it

764
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,619
eats it back into the network for you

765
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,570
it creates envy and it makes you brag it

766
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:59,430
creates humiliation and it makes you

767
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:00,950
humiliate it's a little better than you

768
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:04,440
say it is but you're right of course

769
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:05,730
that it's openly intellectual or

770
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,410
life-affirming

771
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,010
output to the human being isn't very

772
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:14,310
good that's not a defect that's design

773
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:16,650
the purpose of this is not to benefit

774
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,960
the human being that's why the matrix

775
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,810
was the legend for all of this

776
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,970
beforehand

777
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:26,910
the turning a human being into a source

778
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:30,118
of electricity is what this is man right

779
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:32,730
so works pretty good it's cheap

780
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,850
batteries it powers a lot of stuff and

781
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,310
the quality degradation in human thought

782
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:41,339
is a by-product from the machines point

783
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:43,170
of view so don't estimate don't

784
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,280
underestimate the opposition that we've

785
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,600
been fighting them all their lives

786
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,260
they're still pretty good at what they

787
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,839
do I understand the inefficiency in the

788
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,690
sense of I too have trouble losing way I

789
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,630
too could use a network that helped me

790
00:48:54,690 --> 00:49:00,090
live better think better learn better do

791
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,740
better in my life this is the network we

792
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:05,130
meant to have it's not the one we've got

793
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:08,009
if I had your talent for imaginative

794
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:12,630
fiction this is where my imagination

795
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:16,109
would be going one more question so that

796
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:18,680
was a masterful and profound that

797
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:22,859
diagnosis I would like some more

798
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,629
prescription doctor but if it's a

799
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:27,569
misdiagnosis then the prescription

800
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:30,900
wouldn't be any good either so okay well

801
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:33,630
so so if it is true that we understand

802
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,930
the nature of the physiology and we are

803
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:39,390
beginning to grasp its pathology the

804
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,609
problem with prescription in the current

805
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,220
world I have a patented molecule here

806
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:46,319
would you like this you'll live longer

807
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,939
it's precisely the problem we're

808
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,359
experiencing and coming up with

809
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:53,670
solutions what we don't want radical

810
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,529
surgery we don't wish to die but this

811
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,310
can't be patched with somebody's

812
00:49:55,530 --> 00:50:01,160
patented molecule we need as

813
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:04,670
three things politics technology and law

814
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:07,370
I tried admittedly too fast it's just no

815
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,680
time to say at least a little bit about

816
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:12,740
each of those three things in technology

817
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,620
we need to re architect for Federation

818
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:18,319
in politics we need to understand both

819
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,270
the objective of government that is the

820
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:23,210
restoration of the quality of thought

821
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:26,120
and the nature of past human relations

822
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:27,860
and we need to understand the subject of

823
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,230
regulation which is the behavior

824
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:33,350
collection business what do we need in

825
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,510
law we need regulation of the behavior

826
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:37,930
protection business and we need to

827
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:41,890
remove the legal immunity of the

828
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:44,990
intermediaries we need to restore the

829
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:47,690
principles of responsibility for what

830
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,750
they do to the people it injures we

831
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:53,450
lifted the liability of the

832
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:56,140
intermediaries in the 1990s to protect

833
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:59,149
an infant industry against being

834
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:02,900
collapsed by liability that was

835
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:06,410
successful but temporary immunity is

836
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:09,710
becoming permanent above the law Ness or

837
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:12,859
else even worse deputation as the

838
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:15,500
sensors of everybody this won't work

839
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:19,130
we need to restore ordinary principles

840
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,080
of liability and responsibility to one

841
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,950
another and we need to use the legal

842
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:27,410
system to help us therefore reduce this

843
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:30,350
wart that we have developed this

844
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:33,799
forehead up object which is conscripting

845
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:36,620
our biological existence that's the best

846
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,420
prescription I can offer on the usual

847
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,940
small piece of paper and the bad

848
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:43,580
doctor's handwriting barely long enough

849
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,600
and barely legible enough but it's the

850
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:50,750
best I can do for you sorry

851
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:53,750
thank you for the most striking panel

852
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:57,140
I've I've seen I've heard so far at this

853
00:51:53,750 --> 00:52:00,500
república thank you a lot when you were

854
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:05,799
talking about the two crises the climate

855
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:09,510
and the control I was wondering how

856
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:12,640
do Friday's for future fit in your

857
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,420
diagnosis because all those on the

858
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,890
streets

859
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:20,530
they are digital natives and they have

860
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:25,029
been growing up with the machines

861
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:27,760
I am very struck mostly because I spent

862
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:30,280
the quarter century of my life and close

863
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,010
relationship with my dear friend and

864
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,740
comrade Richard Stallman I am very

865
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,750
struck by the relay by the similarity

866
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:42,250
between Greta Sundberg and Richard

867
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:45,580
Stallman I call your attention to a kind

868
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:49,420
of human being absolutely crucial to the

869
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:52,020
well-being of the species I think that

870
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,850
the important point about this

871
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:58,330
intersection and the way that certain

872
00:52:54,850 --> 00:53:02,049
highly focused absolutely stubborn

873
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:05,110
completely impervious ly ethical people

874
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:08,860
are behaving in the human race right now

875
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:12,880
is an indication of why we still have a

876
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:16,240
chance all right I think that's what the

877
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,370
meaning of the very ineffective free

878
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,770
software movement and the highly

879
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,720
effective extinction rebellion or the

880
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:25,870
other way around depending how history

881
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,709
turns out I think the similarity between

882
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:31,420
them is that one the absolutely

883
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:34,030
irreducible unwillingness of certain

884
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:37,690
human beings to live with injustice or

885
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:40,330
to ignore reality and you're right that

886
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:43,840
it may be more easy to get people to

887
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:46,529
strike from school over the climate than

888
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,050
to do something about the smartphone

889
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:52,240
particularly as various forms of social

890
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:58,240
mobilization seem to require the

891
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,979
smartphone but we'll get that right my

892
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,259
friends in the Soviet Union were correct

893
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,840
in their diagnosis okay the prescription

894
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:07,780
that was hard we are lucky that we made

895
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:11,850
it in many human futures we would not

896
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:14,860
have made it we got there by sheer will

897
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:17,500
but we can do this too and in precisely

898
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,920
that way and what young people are

899
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,990
experiencing about

900
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,980
climate they are beginning to experience

901
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:28,848
about privacy - I'll prove this to you

902
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:31,309
last week I watched mr. Zuckerberg give

903
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:34,069
an entire philosophic account of himself

904
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:40,250
on a backdrop that said the future is

905
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:42,619
private that was stunning I admit that

906
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,690
it's hard for mr. Zuckerberg to stun me

907
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:46,520
I was the one who said in a public

908
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,049
speech in 2010 that he had done more

909
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:52,460
harm to the human race than everybody

910
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:54,920
else's age and if I had said in 2010

911
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,720
when I said that and by 2019 you're all

912
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,079
going to agree with me people really

913
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,750
would have thought I was crazy but we

914
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:06,200
have reached a tipping point with social

915
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:08,809
media when even the people running the

916
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:11,629
machine must describe it as pro privacy

917
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:15,619
or people won't use it that's the

918
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:18,079
beginning right of how we get to that

919
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:21,559
unification of young people's awareness

920
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,599
of the physical environment and its

921
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,510
pathologies and the intellectual

922
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,309
environment and its pathologies with our

923
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:29,540
schedule in mind we might have time for

924
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:33,109
two more questions

925
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:34,790
I promise okay I'll pick this up from

926
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:38,000
the Sackville statement

927
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:40,940
I read his comment as the future is

928
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,960
private as we are not sharing our data

929
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:46,309
set and that's also what what I'm you're

930
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,950
talking about we have the largest

931
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:51,770
collection of data on behavior and on of

932
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,450
people which in itself just holds no

933
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:56,089
value the question is what kind of

934
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,669
behaviors do we want to analyze it for

935
00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:00,410
and the data has in itself also the

936
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:02,359
answers to the question what can we do

937
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:03,980
to make it less attractive for people to

938
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:07,759
stay there so shouldn't we be concerned

939
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:09,920
with access to those vast quantities of

940
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,460
data that already exist that are being

941
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,829
mined for profit and not for people's

942
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,140
interests yes we should be concerned

943
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:21,140
about that and if we could figure out a

944
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:23,328
way to hack the system of law regarding

945
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,940
data about people as effectively as we

946
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:28,579
had copyright in software we would have

947
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:31,550
the relevant tool but we still haven't

948
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:33,290
got there and so the result is that we

949
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,390
accumulating the equivalent of

950
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,230
radioactive waste and we don't know what

951
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:40,100
to do with it

952
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:42,170
I wish to stop digging the hole but it

953
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,700
doesn't mean I'm not also very worried

954
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:49,610
about what we have already extracted

955
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:55,520
from it one more thank you I would like

956
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:59,870
to introduce a different I'm not so good

957
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:05,180
in English we are using for artificial

958
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:08,359
intelligence the the to a I and in

959
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:11,450
Germany it is ki and I would like to

960
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,390
introduce the the idea of expanded art

961
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:17,270
so that it's not artificial intelligence

962
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:21,379
but our the the the intelligence of

963
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:24,530
artists and the idea of an artist is to

964
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:29,240
take responsibility for his whole work

965
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:32,360
and we should get together in the idea

966
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:34,250
that we are all artists in the world and

967
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:38,440
we have the responsibility for the

968
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:45,080
future and directly everyone itself and

969
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:48,970
we should find a way how we can get

970
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:55,340
together without passing over our

971
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:57,980
responsibility to very few people is

972
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,560
this a question or a statement what it's

973
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,630
just it needs nothing but omage I agree

974
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,340
with you entirely here is the problem

975
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,910
one of the greatest artists of my

976
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,050
generation was Steven P jobs and

977
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:13,040
therefore I must point out to you that

978
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:15,320
art is not as morally obviously right

979
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,470
thinking as we would like to believe art

980
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,580
is entirely consistent with moral

981
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:23,060
monstrosity

982
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,660
one last question please yeah thank you

983
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,750
so much

984
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,759
I wonder if we do trust machines more

985
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:33,140
than ourselves talking about the

986
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:34,970
internal space you were referring to the

987
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,808
source of tragedy is that we trust the

988
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:41,348
Machine more than we trust one another

989
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:44,859
this this is the beginning of why we go

990
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:46,930
wrong because in preference to the

991
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:50,049
difficulty of sorting it out among

992
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:52,719
ourselves we believe that more data and

993
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:56,469
more analysis in more chips running

994
00:58:52,719 --> 00:59:00,640
faster will solve the problems we do not

995
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:02,890
understand who we are we are the animal

996
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,279
that has become what we are through our

997
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:09,129
