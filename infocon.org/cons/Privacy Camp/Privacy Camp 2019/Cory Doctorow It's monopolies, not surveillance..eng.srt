[Music]

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:31,000
huh so whoops come one too far yeah so

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,420
hi I've been fighting over internet

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,160
regulations since 2002 and back then the

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,590
big issue is whether Napster should be

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,360
liable for the things that its users did

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,670
and back then it was a real struggle to

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,530
convey to people that the outcome of the

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,020
Napster fight was about so much more

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,120
than access to music it was about

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,699
whether the network that would someday

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,980
grow to be our planetary scaled nervous

16
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,960
system for our whole species would be

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,860
regulated as though were some kind of

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,130
troublesome jukebox then as the years

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,050
went by something changed people woke up

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,630
to the fact that the Internet wasn't

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,820
just a glorified video on-demand service

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,429
or the world's greatest pornography

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,529
distribution system or the best way ever

24
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,649
conceived of for recruiting jihadis to

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,780
commit acts of terror people started to

26
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,490
see the Internet as a tool that had

27
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,190
become essential to their family lives

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,869
their romantic lives their education

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,060
their employment their political and

30
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:30,910
their civic engagement their play in

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,170
their business and all of that didn't

32
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,789
mean that we couldn't ever hope to

33
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,149
regulate the Internet but it did mean

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:39,700
that we needed to regulate it carefully

35
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,619
with gravitas and a sense that any

36
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,899
misstep could have unintended

37
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,899
consequences that would ripple out into

38
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,640
many domains of our lives and I started

39
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,160
to hold out hopes that we might be able

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,300
to not only regulate the Internet well

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,729
in the future but that we might even

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,369
reverse our stupidest mistakes of the

43
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,959
past like those rules that bans

44
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,929
circumvention of copyright protection

45
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,910
systems those rules were originally

46
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,640
intended to add legal weight to

47
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,250
nuisances like having region coding and

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,670
DVD players the way that it works is

49
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,830
that infringing or rather removing a

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,269
copyright lock constitutes an

51
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,489
infringement even if you don't violate

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,700
copyright and and it had to work that

53
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,950
way because D regionalizing a DVD player

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,630
that's not a copyright infringement it's

55
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,630
the opposite of a copyright infringement

56
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,250
if you go overseas and you buy a DVD

57
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,260
from the store and you pay the price

58
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,900
that they've asked and you take it back

59
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,030
home and then you watch it

60
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,799
that's the opposite of piracy right

61
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,319
that's what copyright is supposed to do

62
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,790
it's supposed to say you you go and you

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,379
pay the price that you're asked and then

64
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,629
you enjoy it in the way that you're

65
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,849
expected to and so the only way that

66
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,798
these anti-circumvention rules could be

67
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,078
effective at stopping you from D

68
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,290
regionalizing your DVD player is if they

69
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,859
banned and removing a copyright lock

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:03,090
even when you didn't infringe copyright

71
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:05,159
so even so it wasn't hard to remove

72
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,040
these locks and so they needed a legal

73
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,899
backstop that that included a legal

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,470
prohibition as well as a technical

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,940
measure and you know as and originally

76
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,129
this confined itself to just these

77
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,650
fringe applications like DVD players and

78
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,298
the Sega Dreamcast things where you had

79
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,939
a copyright law to protect something

80
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,909
that wasn't protected by copyright but

81
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:29,670
over time anything that had software in

82
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,099
it grew a copyrighted work in it because

83
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,540
all software is copyrighted and so once

84
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,909
you have a device with it with caught

85
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,888
with a software inside of it you can add

86
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:39,480
a copyright lock and all of a sudden

87
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:41,819
these anti-circumvention rules like

88
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,698
article 6 of the european copyright

89
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,899
directive from 2001 and section 12 1 of

90
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,230
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,769
suddenly ban changing that device to do

92
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,470
legal things and so over time we started

93
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,389
to see copyright locks creeping from DVD

94
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,519
players and Sega Dreamcast's into every

95
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,049
application of our lives so now we have

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,959
copyright locks and implanted

97
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:06,540
defibrillators and in car engines and in

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,419
thermostats and in coffee makers and

99
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,909
inviting machines and in tractors and

100
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,739
these laws they're an attractive

101
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,380
nuisance because they promise

102
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,019
manufacturers that if they skin their

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,719
products in a one molecule thick layer

104
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,940
of digital rights management and design

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,060
them so that using the product in any

106
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,409
way the manufacturer doesn't like

107
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,470
involves removing the copyright lock

108
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:33,240
then they can make it illegal to use a

109
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,210
product in the way that the manufacturer

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,139
doesn't like and in the u.s. violating

111
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,150
this law of the digital learning

112
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,979
Copyright Act it's punishable by a five

113
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,049
year prison sentence and a five hundred

114
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,570
thousand dollar fine for a first offense

115
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,220
and so what that means is that if you

116
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,590
use a

117
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,320
copyright lock judiciously you can

118
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,020
bootstrap a new legal regime called

119
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,969
felony contempt of business model where

120
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,830
your customers using the products that

121
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,320
you sell them in ways that benefit them

122
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,990
instead of your shareholders becomes a

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,310
literal crime and the taxpayers will pay

124
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:10,310
to enforce it but we're still these laws

125
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,680
they chill security research because

126
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,120
when a security researcher reveals that

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,640
there's a defect in a system with a

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,740
copyright lock they make it easier to

129
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,510
remove that copyright lock and so

130
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,610
security researchers treat these as a

131
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,469
no-go zone and they don't want to talk

132
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,070
about the defects in these systems and

133
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,440
so now we have this ever-expanding

134
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,540
constellation of devices that treat

135
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,790
their owners as their adversaries that

136
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,400
security researchers can't audit that

137
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,590
good guys know about bugs in but they

138
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,179
won't tell you about them and bad guys

139
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,909
know about bugs in them and they get to

140
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,770
exploit them forever because the good

141
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,669
guys never tell you that the products

142
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,700
you're using are defective so these laws

143
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,409
were right for reform but as the years

144
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,719
went by and people got online and

145
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,000
network policy touched more corners of

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,860
their lives the absurdity of copyright

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,120
law that this this idea this this

148
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,160
regulatory framework for the

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,620
entertainment industry being the one

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,690
tool that we would use to regulate all

151
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,479
of our online lives it just became more

152
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,310
obvious how foolish that was and it

153
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,260
seemed like the time was ready ready for

154
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,790
a change like maybe we are arriving at a

155
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,250
moment when we would start to take

156
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,940
Network policy seriously instead of

157
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,419
treating out as this evidence free zone

158
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,860
but then the last 12 months happened and

159
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:31,190
the last 12 months have been a nightmare

160
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,530
assault a kind of blitzkrieg of terrible

161
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,110
network policies swiftly ushered into

162
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,989
law with little or no public debate and

163
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,970
in the worst of faith we had the

164
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,400
Australian ban on working security

165
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,290
systems and America's attack on the

166
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,810
online discussion of sex and sexuality

167
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,750
and the European mandate on copyright

168
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,310
filters for all human expression and now

169
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,530
in the wake of the Christchurch white

170
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,539
terrorist attacks we have global

171
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,640
initiatives requiring that online

172
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,289
platforms be ready to take down material

173
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,180
that is allegedly terrorist

174
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,820
at the drop of a hat so quickly that

175
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,800
humans couldn't possibly review the

176
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,930
these the material before it's taken

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,000
down and these are already law in

178
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,080
Australia and they're steaming towards

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,020
becoming law in Europe and in the UK the

180
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,789
last year has been a real-time

181
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,700
high-speed China fication of our Western

182
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,500
internet a system where our networks are

183
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,420
increasingly subject to surveillance and

184
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,640
control that has not been dreamt of

185
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,770
since the old days when every

186
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,390
communication that we had electronically

187
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,120
went through one state-owned monopoly

188
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,700
telephone company that had total control

189
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,280
over who spoke who they spoke to and

190
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,140
could monitor any one of those calls but

191
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,909
unlike those days when the telephone

192
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,130
that you used was wired into your

193
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,870
kitchen and attached to the wall now the

194
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,730
telephones are in our pockets and they

195
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,150
know everywhere we go and everything we

196
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,760
do and everyone we talk to and those are

197
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,130
now subject to a kind of control that

198
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,760
even exceeds the control that we had in

199
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,469
the day of the telco monopolies and

200
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,390
unlike those days if you want to spy on

201
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,760
all of our communications you don't need

202
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,940
to hire a giant room full of Stasi

203
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,380
snitches to listen in unlike those days

204
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,500
we can now just get an algorithm to

205
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,380
listen to everybody and I want to take a

206
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,360
moment before I go on to how we got here

207
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,040
to just review in detail all the

208
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,610
terrible stuff that's happened in the

209
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,130
last year because in 2019 news comes at

210
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,740
you fast and it's easy to miss things as

211
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,530
they happen so let's start with the ban

212
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,260
on working cryptography since the late

213
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,510
1980s law enforcement and surveillance

214
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,330
apparatus have been warning that if

215
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,080
everyone had access to cryptography that

216
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,810
terrible things would happen until 1992

217
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,360
the American National Security Agency

218
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,209
they classed any working cryptography as

219
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,070
a form of munition and they refused to

220
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,230
allow civilians to have access to

221
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,860
working crypto and instead they had a

222
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,050
toy scrambling system called des 50 that

223
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,000
they said was so strong that bank

224
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,280
robbers and criminals and foreign spies

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,920
would never break it but at the same

226
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,650
time it was so weak that the NSA could

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,189
break into it to spy on bad guys if they

228
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,160
absolutely

229
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,810
they had to and in 1992 the Electronic

230
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,060
Frontier Foundation represented an

231
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,260
undergraduate our grad student rather at

232
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,180
the University of California at Berkeley

233
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,250
named Daniel J Bernstein

234
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,520
d JB is now a very famous cryptographer

235
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,560
and DJ bee he was publishing strong

236
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,780
cryptography as open sources free

237
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,989
software on the early internet before

238
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,490
the web he was publishing it on Usenet

239
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,430
which was a messaging platform and who's

240
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,650
posting source code to it and we argued

241
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,810
to the Ninth Circuit in the 9th circuit

242
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,459
or a Court of Appeals that publishing

243
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,719
source code was a form of expressive

244
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,330
speech and was protected under the

245
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,310
American Constitution under under the

246
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,900
First Amendment and the Ninth Circuit

247
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,760
agreed with us and then the Appellate

248
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,230
Division agreed with us the National

249
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,819
Security Agency they didn't like their

250
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,740
chances of the Supreme Court and since

251
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,480
then we've all had access to working

252
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,550
cryptography cryptography that works so

253
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,650
well that when you take a picture with

254
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,750
your phone if the full disk encryption

255
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,900
is turned on which it is by an default

256
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,430
now then before the picture has even

257
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,800
saved it has been scrambled so

258
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,060
thoroughly that if every hydrogen atom

259
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,310
in the universe were turned into a

260
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,410
computer and it did nothing between now

261
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,569
and the death of the universe but trying

262
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,850
guess what key was needed to unscramble

263
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:28,420
your picture without asking you for the

264
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,610
password we would run out of universe

265
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,990
before we ran out of possible

266
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:38,360
unscrambling keys so crypto really works

267
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,970
and today every one of us uses strong

268
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,680
encryption all day long every network we

269
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,750
use automatically encrypt our data

270
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,310
between us and the router every

271
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,530
Bluetooth device we use automatically

272
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,630
encrypts our our keystrokes so that they

273
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,300
can't be intercepted by people who are

274
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,010
standing nearby us when your computer or

275
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,780
your printer or any other device

276
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,030
receives a software update for the

277
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,140
manufacturer we use crypto to make sure

278
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,240
that it came from the software

279
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,430
manufacturer and then it wasn't inserted

280
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,620
by a malicious party in order to attack

281
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,359
you by either compromising your device

282
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,250
and steal its data or compromising your

283
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,910
device and having it break into other

284
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,800
devices on your network crypto protects

285
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,790
the integrity of your data and it

286
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,650
protects the integrity of your

287
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,400
communications and it protects your

288
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,780
devices

289
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,850
it's what stands between you and

290
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,480
identity theft or someone murdering you

291
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,279
by compromising that computer

292
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,490
your car or in the defibrillator

293
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,010
implanted in your chest which is great

294
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,410
news if you're if you want to protect

295
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,420
yourself from malicious attacks but

296
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,279
authoritarians have never given up on

297
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,500
the project of breaking working crypto

298
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,689
and they cite the Four Horsemen of the

299
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,339
information apocalypse whenever they say

300
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,959
that it's time to get rid of crypto at

301
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:51,029
last those four horsemen are pedophiles

302
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,609
terrorists criminals and drug dealers

303
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,970
and they insist that it is possible to

304
00:11:53,610 --> 00:12:00,089
ban working crypto but still make people

305
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,740
safe from criminals now the former Prime

306
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:03,600
Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull

307
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,130
he was very big on this he said that he

308
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,540
was going to ban working crypto in

309
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,279
Australia but he would nevertheless have

310
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,769
crypto that would protect Australians

311
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,689
from bad guys and when mathematicians

312
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:15,209
told him that it violated the laws of

313
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,910
mathematics to say that we would develop

314
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,130
an encryption system that worked

315
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,350
perfectly when bad guys were trying to

316
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,149
attack it but failed perfectly when good

317
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,769
guys were trying to attack it he said

318
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,660
the stupidest thing in the history of

319
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:29,610
internet regulation that is a crowded

320
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,670
field but I think you'll agree that he

321
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,889
wins he said the law of the laws of

322
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,569
Australia prevail in Australia I can

323
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,970
assure you of that the laws of

324
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:41,010
mathematics are very commendable but the

325
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,839
only law that applies in Australia is

326
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:47,939
the law of Australia now you laugh and

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,519
you should laugh because it's it's it's

328
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,380
visible that a grown-ass adults in a

329
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,319
suit with high office said this thing

330
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,839
but a year later Australia band working

331
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,180
crypto and they passed a law that

332
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,430
requires any technology company with a

333
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,229
nexus with the Australian Government to

334
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,489
insert backdoors into their crypto on

335
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:11,160
demand so that's what's happened in the

336
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,180
encryption wars in the last year now

337
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,719
let's talk about everyone's favorite

338
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,579
subject sex the world's democracies when

339
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,560
the internet came along they needed to

340
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:22,079
figure out how to relate to the Internet

341
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,609
what what the liability regime would be

342
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,180
and the answer they came up with is

343
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,800
something we call safe harbors and the

344
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,050
way that safe harbors work is they try

345
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,719
to preserve a platform for speech but

346
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,339
also create a streamlined system of

347
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,290
justice for people who are harmed by

348
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,100
that speech so let's think about how

349
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,410
this works

350
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,500
in the offline world in the offline

351
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,540
world people who are party to bad speech

352
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,610
are often liable for it so if you're a

353
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,069
bookseller and your bookstore has an

354
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,500
infringing book under many copyright

355
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:54,209
systems you the bookseller can be held

356
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,980
liable for selling the increment

357
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,660
infringing book even if you didn't know

358
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,149
was infringing even if the publisher

359
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,880
promised you that it was in compliance

360
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:05,040
with copyright law and so people who are

361
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,319
aggrieved under copyright law they can

362
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,000
pick the person in the value chain with

363
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,050
the deepest pockets the publisher the

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,389
printer the bookseller

365
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,599
and they can go after them one of them

366
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,509
are all of them and and and get justice

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,100
out of them now that would be really

368
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,889
hard for people who provide online

369
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,630
platforms for speech because you

370
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:26,310
couldn't possibly hope to evaluate

371
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,709
everything that a user said on say

372
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,359
Twitter or even on your local bulletin

373
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,758
board system for people who really like

374
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,290
cats and knowing that everything that's

375
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,269
posted to that bulletin board complies

376
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,610
with copyright law and hasn't been

377
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:40,589
pasted from another cat board by someone

378
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,529
who really liked a message and wanted to

379
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,209
pass it off as their own and so it would

380
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,829
be impossible to have a platform for

381
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,199
speech if you were on the hook for

382
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:52,739
copyright and so what safe harbors do is

383
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,500
they take platforms off the hook for for

384
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,050
bad speech acts by their users but

385
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,970
people who are who are damaged by those

386
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,459
users speech they get something in

387
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,500
return I used to be a bookseller and I

388
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,000
worked in a bookstore and if we had a

389
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,310
book that you thought infringed your

390
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,470
copyright you could not walk into the

391
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,319
bookstore point at the book on the shelf

392
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,079
and say that book infringes my copyright

393
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:17,399
I demand that you remove it right now

394
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,380
the minimum wage clerk behind the

395
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,149
counter would say you'll have to talk to

396
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,069
my boss and the boss would say you'll

397
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,870
have to talk to a judge and once you

398
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:27,060
have a court order will remove that book

399
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,370
for you and safe harbors they do away

400
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,229
with this due process as well they allow

401
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,709
people who've been harmed by bad acts of

402
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,959
speech to simply present a claim to the

403
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,758
on lines platform and usually to some

404
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,670
the equivalent of me behind the cash

405
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,880
register some minimum-wage employee

406
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,709
often in a Pacific Rim data center or

407
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,149
you know call center and they get an

408
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,760
email that says this infringes my

409
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:51,500
copyright this is harassing me this is

410
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,120
doing something

411
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,400
that is that constitutes a bad speech

412
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,230
act I want it removed from the Internet

413
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,730
and more often than not it just

414
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,800
disappears without ever having to talk

415
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,650
to a judge so this is the balance the

416
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,390
safe harbor struck we immunize platforms

417
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,240
from the bad speech acts of their users

418
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,550
and we give users the power to remove

419
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,650
bad speech if it harms them without

420
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,150
having to speak to a judge and then when

421
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,400
there's a disagreement there then it all

422
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,709
goes to court and this is a wildly

423
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,630
imperfect system with many defects but

424
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,190
we have managed to find a worse one to

425
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,840
replace it with so in the US the safe

426
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,690
harbors regime it didn't protect

427
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,790
companies that knowingly allowed sex

428
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,340
trafficking to happen on their platforms

429
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,839
if you had actual knowledge that one of

430
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,410
your users was engaged in sex

431
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,480
trafficking

432
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:43,250
you had liability if you didn't shut it

433
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:45,020
down but that wasn't enough in 2018 the

434
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,240
US Congress passed a bill called Faust

435
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,500
assess assess - Fausta depending on

436
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,100
whether you like Congress or the Senate

437
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:55,310
more and cesta FASTA says that you have

438
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,200
an obligation to know whether any of the

439
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,680
speech on your platform involves sex

440
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,000
trafficking so it's not enough that if

441
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,069
you know about it you have to take it

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,079
down now you have a duty to find out

443
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,359
whether there's sex trafficking taking

444
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,399
place and this is a duty that's very

445
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,958
hard to fulfill because it's hard to

446
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,430
know a priori if you're on a message

447
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,630
board we're consenting adults are

448
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,339
talking about having sex with one

449
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,500
another whether one of them isn't

450
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,720
consenting right whether one of them as

451
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,780
being as being trafficked that Duty

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,339
turned out to be so onerous that

453
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,439
virtually every platform in which people

454
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,389
discussed sex and sexuality for the

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,800
purposes of consummating a sexual

456
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:36,950
relationship in the u.s. shut down and

457
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,960
this has been a great harm to actual sex

458
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,820
workers who now tell us that because

459
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,530
they've lost every forum in which they

460
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,990
used to warn each other about clients

461
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,330
who were violent or dangerous that they

462
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,310
now face much more violence and since

463
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,409
they can no longer arrange online

464
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,629
assignation x' they're walking the

465
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,970
streets again the only people who

466
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,310
benefited from cesta FASTA the only

467
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,440
people whose lives have been made

468
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,690
conclusively better are pimps because

469
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,570
now that sex workers are working on the

470
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:09,019
street again they need to have pimps for

471
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,539
this has been a golden age for for

472
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,460
pimping as a result of this bill that

473
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,879
was notionally intended to protect

474
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,309
people from human trafficking sex has

475
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:22,609
become the go-to means for attacking

476
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:25,969
privacy anonymity and speech starting

477
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:28,129
this summer in the United Kingdom every

478
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:30,710
platform that provides access to erotic

479
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:33,439
material adult material will be required

480
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,929
to validate the age of every user who

481
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,789
accesses that material if you're a

482
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,950
uk-based site and you don't adhere to

483
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:42,229
this your site will be you will be

484
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,089
punished under British law if you're an

485
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,710
offshore site and you don't adhere to

486
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:48,139
this you'll be blocked at the border

487
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,749
using the national firewall and these

488
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:53,119
age checks will require a credit card so

489
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:54,979
that when these databases leak not if

490
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:59,359
these databases leak when these

491
00:18:54,979 --> 00:19:01,609
databases leak the attackers will be

492
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,649
able to cross-reference your sexual

493
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,739
fetishes with how much money you have

494
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:10,099
and whether it's worth blackmailing you

495
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:14,210
and and and so that's what's happening

496
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:17,869
in the UK and then there's tumblr poor

497
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,059
tumblr tumblr was once a haven for

498
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:22,249
sexual expression including notably

499
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:26,330
women's sexual expression and sexual

500
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:28,999
expression by LG LGBTQI people and in

501
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,678
2018 Apple got really worried about

502
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,269
cesta FASTA and they said we're not

503
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,519
going to carry the tumblr app anymore

504
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:38,719
because it might involve sex trafficking

505
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:41,539
and this was the spur that tumblr needed

506
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,429
to deploy algorithms to root out and

507
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:46,309
delete anything that might be sexual

508
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,229
content on the system but algorithmic

509
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:51,499
filters are crude and imperfect

510
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:52,940
instruments these are all items from my

511
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:54,919
own tumblr that had been blocked by

512
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,389
tumblr and I want to particularly call

513
00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:00,669
your attention to the one on the far

514
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:03,709
left there that is tumblers image

515
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:07,009
example image of the kind of nudity that

516
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,669
tumblr will not block it's been blocked

517
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,669
by tumblr

518
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,920
yeah so speaking of filters last month

519
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,050
the European Union took the most drastic

520
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,880
step to censor and centralize the

521
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,399
Internet in the history of the so-called

522
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,350
free world the European Parliament

523
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,090
passed the copyright directive including

524
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,800
the dreaded article 13 which is now

525
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,860
article 17 because nothing is ever easy

526
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,020
in the European Parliament

527
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,090
so article 13 it's a rule that

528
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,370
obliterates the safe harbor not for sex

529
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,590
trafficking or for cryptography but for

530
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,570
copyright infringement and makes a lot

531
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:46,179
of platforms libel if their users

532
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:49,300
infringe copyright and like cesta this

533
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,340
rule applies even if you think that your

534
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,020
users aren't infringing copyright even

535
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,120
if you don't have actual knowledge of

536
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,250
the infringement which creates

537
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,469
effectively a duty to monitor everything

538
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,700
your users post to find out whether or

539
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,550
not they're violating the copyright

540
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,650
directive now that has to mean filters

541
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,590
of course it means filters YouTube alone

542
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,240
gets 400 hours of video every minute

543
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,179
there just aren't enough human beings

544
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,950
who understand copyright on earth to

545
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,810
review all of the footage that YouTube's

546
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,690
users upload and make a determination

547
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:22,169
about whether all of that footage any of

548
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,250
that footage infringes copyright and

549
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,470
despite the fact that this obviously

550
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,090
meant filters during the debate the

551
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,090
proponents of the copyright directive

552
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:33,370
insisted that it didn't require filters

553
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,770
in fact they said right there in the

554
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:39,909
directive it says if at all possible

555
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:43,389
don't use filters well alright if I made

556
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:47,350
a law that said I require you to produce

557
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:50,320
a large gray charismatic African land

558
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:53,919
mammal and it must have four legs and a

559
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,470
tail and tusks and a trunk but if it but

560
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,890
if at all possible it should not be an

561
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:03,790
elephant I would still get an elephant

562
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:05,950
and if we say the directive requires

563
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,480
that you know about all of the things

564
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,610
your users post and make sure that they

565
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,020
don't infringe copyright and you have

566
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,419
users who post more than any human

567
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,639
moderation team could review you will

568
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,290
always get filters and now we know of

569
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,040
course that it means that we're going to

570
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,629
get filters because within days of the

571
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,020
directive passing the French government

572
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,400
a noun

573
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,590
that it would transpose this into law

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,730
with filters and then the German

575
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,439
government admitted that it would

576
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,390
probably need filters too and it's

577
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,220
national implementation and then the

578
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,570
commissioner who pushed for this said

579
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,470
that of course it was going to require

580
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:41,379
filters despite what he'd said earlier

581
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,420
so in 2017 Germany became one of the

582
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,200
world's great net net exporters of

583
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,200
privacy rules in 2019 Germany and France

584
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,300
teamed up to take away from America the

585
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,559
world cup for exporting the world's

586
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,090
worst privacy and censorship regimes

587
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,710
everything we post from now on is going

588
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,750
to be compared to a database of

589
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,250
copyrighted works and blocked if an

590
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,740
algorithm thinks it looks too much like

591
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,420
a copyrighted work but of course when I

592
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,950
say it's going to be matched against a

593
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,870
database of copyrighted works that's not

594
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,240
quite true it's going to be matched

595
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,360
against a database of works that someone

596
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,370
says are copyrighted but there's no

597
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,928
checks and balances in the system to

598
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,790
determine whether or not all the works

599
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,500
that are included are copyrighted

600
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,230
there's nothing to stop someone from

601
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,270
claiming the works of William

602
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,490
Shakespeare or the alphabet or the song

603
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,290
happy birthday and it's blocked until

604
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,790
someone goes in and pulls those records

605
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,800
out and makes a determination and pulls

606
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,270
those records out and when we propose

607
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,520
that there should be a rule that

608
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:42,309
punishes people for negligently or

609
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,260
deliberately adding material to the to

610
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,389
these copyright block lists that they

611
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,240
don't own the copyright to that proposal

612
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,800
was shot down in flames and so after the

613
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,580
directive goes into effect you might

614
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,678
have images of a cop hitting a protester

615
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,870
at a demonstration disappearing thanks

616
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,150
to a spurious copyright claim or a

617
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,159
picture of a company's effluent pipe

618
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,160
dumping toxic waste into your drinking

619
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,690
water and the remedy will be to get in

620
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,670
line behind everyone else whose

621
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,820
materials were unjustly blocked and

622
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,730
asked to have it unblocked

623
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,250
but there's more because just two weeks

624
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,110
after this directive passed there was an

625
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,090
act of terrible white supremacist

626
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,178
violence in New Zealand where a

627
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,059
terrorist shot up two mosques in

628
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:29,890
Christchurch and in the wake of that

629
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,649
attack which was live streamed on

630
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,450
Facebook everyone around the world has

631
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,190
been getting in line to figure out how

632
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,740
to punish the platforms for letting this

633
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,429
happen

634
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,350
so in Australia they've passed a rule

635
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:44,830
requiring platforms to remove material

636
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,629
of a terroristic nature within an hour

637
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,070
and in the European Union we're

638
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,590
advancing the terror regulation which

639
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,178
has the same regime and the UK and the

640
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,370
mother of all parliaments just tabled

641
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,590
further evidence towards making this the

642
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,729
reality there and in case you're

643
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,770
thinking that this sounds reasonable

644
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,779
because anything that it takes to remove

645
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,668
terrorist material from the internet is

646
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:07,520
probably worth it given how horrific

647
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:10,309
that attack was consider that last month

648
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,320
the French government their anti-terror

649
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:13,908
police sent a notice to the internet

650
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,590
archive the people who run the internet

651
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,809
wayback machine and hosts open access

652
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,520
collections and they said we have

653
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:21,710
identified within your within these

654
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,450
three special collections terroristic

655
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,940
works and we require that they be

656
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,830
removed within 24 hours the three

657
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,929
collections they identified where the

658
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,658
gutenberg archive which is every public

659
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:35,000
domain book that's ever been scanned 15

660
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:37,010
million text files and the internet

661
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,360
archives collection of Grateful Dead

662
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,950
recordings they gave them 24 hours to

663
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,678
sort through this but under the pending

664
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,720
Yuki u terror regulation they would only

665
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
have one hour to make sense of it and

666
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,980
they would face being blocked at the

667
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,880
border if they fail to comply and these

668
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,940
demands they're not signed by a judge

669
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,380
they're not reviewed by anyone and the

670
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,909
European Union tear regulation

671
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,590
originally included filters as a

672
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,990
requirement and they were removed at the

673
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,059
last moment but again if you're going to

674
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,799
get rules that require you to sift

675
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,360
through tens of millions of documents in

676
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:12,289
one hour there's no way that you're

677
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,340
going to be able to do that without

678
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:17,870
filters almost overnight we have gone

679
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,730
from an Internet where speech had the

680
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,590
presumption of innocence where your

681
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,840
speech was innocent at least until

682
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,549
someone accused it of being guilty to

683
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,980
one in which all speech is guilty until

684
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,830
proven innocent everything that we post

685
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,380
is run through blackbox algorithms that

686
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,779
make a judgement in the dark whose

687
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,190
deliberations were not privy to about

688
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,350
whether your speech fits into these

689
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:43,130
nebulous categories like sex trafficking

690
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:46,010
or terrorism or copyright infringement

691
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:47,399
or extremism and this all happened on

692
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,779
our watch

693
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:50,549
and it happened in large part because we

694
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:53,070
hate the platforms and we hate them for

695
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:55,649
good reason right no one is happy about

696
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,869
our internet fruit future having turned

697
00:26:55,649 --> 00:26:59,488
into a world that consists of five giant

698
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:03,629
websites filled with screenshots from

699
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:06,179
the other four but ironically our desire

700
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:06,949
to punish the platforms is a reward in

701
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,089
disguise

702
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,309
think about how filters are going to

703
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,719
play out Google has already spent a

704
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,070
hundred million dollars building a

705
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:16,589
filter for YouTube

706
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,570
it's called Content ID it does a small

707
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:20,279
percentage of what the art of what

708
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,139
article 13 envisions and they'll be able

709
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,429
to adapt it for that purpose and that's

710
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:26,099
why during the copyright directive

711
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:27,960
debate the CEO of YouTube wrote a public

712
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,059
blog post on YouTube's blogs saying

713
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,739
although we oppose the directives broad

714
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:33,119
strokes we think that filters are

715
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:35,549
probably a good idea and we can probably

716
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,408
make them happen because while Google's

717
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,809
first preference is obviously to have no

718
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:41,309
regulation their second preferences to

719
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:44,700
have regulation that's so onerous that

720
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:46,349
only Google can comply with it because

721
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,119
there aren't any European tech startups

722
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:50,668
with an extra 100 million euros kicking

723
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:52,439
around to roll into filters when when

724
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,690
the rule comes into effect and when they

725
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,039
become liable to enforce under it and so

726
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,929
that means that the stroke of a pen the

727
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,179
European Union signed the death warrant

728
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,369
for the entire tech sector and that

729
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,830
leaves the hetfield open for a handful

730
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:07,109
of us-based tech giants who can't afford

731
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,678
filters to take over Europe's Internet

732
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:13,080
and that UK porn blockade it's going to

733
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,259
be administered by the Canadian porn

734
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,369
giant mine geek and mine geeks holdings

735
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:23,159
include pornhub redtube youporn browsers

736
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:25,349
Digital Playground men.com reality kings

737
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,479
and Shaun Cody and this is a company

738
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:30,539
that grew by taking any competitor that

739
00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:33,059
it had its eyes on and allowing clips to

740
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:35,039
be uploaded to its own platform in a way

741
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,749
that deprived those those rivals of

742
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,700
their revenue that they got from their

743
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:40,649
paywalls it waited until they were

744
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,299
brought to their knees by not getting

745
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:44,699
those payments and then it bought them

746
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,859
for pennies on the dollar and now that

747
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,649
company will be in charge of all of the

748
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,899
competitors that it hasn't yet taken

749
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:55,018
over and it will get to determine their

750
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:56,609
destiny too is it any wonder that Mark

751
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,129
Zuckerberg went to Congress last month

752
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,509
and said please regulate Facebook he's

753
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:02,030
betting that with write Facebook at the

754
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:03,830
table any regular

755
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:05,300
that that Congress makes will be

756
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,949
regulation that Facebook can afford

757
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,139
Congress is not going to make a rule

758
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,230
that says no Facebook and that none of

759
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,600
its competitors will be able to afford

760
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,880
so how do we get here how is it that the

761
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,669
tech sector has become so totally

762
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,710
concentrated well it's not just the tech

763
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:24,050
sector every sector has become

764
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,970
concentrated over the last 40 years

765
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,040
there's four movie studios it was five

766
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,280
until last month now Fox in Disney or

767
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,930
one there's four record labels there's

768
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,580
five publishers for now but soon there

769
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,170
should be four because the word is that

770
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,980
Simon & Schuster will become a division

771
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,680
of HarperCollins

772
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:41,750
and there's only one eye where company

773
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,700
left if you're wearing glasses just have

774
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,700
a look now at who made them if your

775
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,190
glasses were made by Armani Brooks

776
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,290
Brothers Burberry Chanel coach DKNY

777
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,910
Dolce & Gabbana Michael Kors

778
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,680
Oakley all over people's personal rough

779
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,360
Polo Ralph Lauren Raven Tiffany

780
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,220
Valentino Vogue and Versace

781
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,590
or if you bought them at Pearl Vision

782
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,510
Sears Optical sunglass hut or Target

783
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:05,570
optical or if you're they were insured

784
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,040
by IMed Vision Care or or if your lenses

785
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,530
were made by else'll or the largest

786
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,420
maker of lenses and contact lenses in

787
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,800
the world they all came from one company

788
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,240
a company called luxottica in Italy and

789
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,710
only that there's only one wrestling

790
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,240
league left it used to be 30 of them now

791
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,520
there's one it's worth 3.5 billion

792
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,470
dollars it gets to clasp its employees

793
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,850
as contractors and not give the medical

794
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,820
care which is why they're dropping dead

795
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,159
in their 40s and when you ask tech

796
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,290
sector investors how it got so big those

797
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,090
people have lots of answers they'll tell

798
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,580
you that it's because tech has first

799
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:43,159
mover advantages and it has Network

800
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,290
effects but that doesn't explain why

801
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,870
everything that's not tech got so

802
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,210
concentrated did wrestling get affected

803
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:52,520
by network effects by first mover

804
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:54,110
advantages I think to understand how

805
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,750
everything got so concentrated we need

806
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,760
to go back to a very special year 1979

807
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,620
that's the year the first commercially

808
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,360
successful personal computer hits it hit

809
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,489
the market and that's the year that this

810
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,649
guy hit the command a hit the campaign

811
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:08,990
trail and made a successful bid for

812
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,200
Pregnant's for a presidency beg your

813
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,200
pardon

814
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:17,340
and Reagan wasn't alone Reagan was part

815
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,990
of a cohort of politicians who all came

816
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,669
in around that year you have Margo

817
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,360
Thatcher in the UK Brian Mulroney in

818
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,190
Canada

819
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,020
you had Helmut Kohl here in Germany you

820
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,450
had a gusto Pinochet and Chile obviously

821
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,190
didn't get elected and they all took

822
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,750
power at a moment in which the amount of

823
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,280
wealth that was in the hands of the

824
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,500
richest people on earth had finally

825
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,990
rebounded from the years after the war

826
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,030
in which the capital destruction of

827
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,590
World War two left everybody a lot

828
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,840
poorer and since the people who were

829
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,970
very rich had the most to lose they were

830
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,290
a lot poorer too and they lost their

831
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,790
grip on the levers of power but by 1979

832
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,010
or so the amount of wealth that they

833
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:54,450
held had Ryu Malay today point where

834
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,670
they could start making their policy

835
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,620
prerogatives felt and start expressing

836
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,720
them in the public sphere

837
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,669
now Reagan subscribed to one

838
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,490
particularly bizarre theory about how

839
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,890
how our economy should be regulated this

840
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,050
theory of antitrust law that said that

841
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,520
monopolies were fine that antitrust s--

842
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,290
goal should not be to break up

843
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,300
monopolies but just to be sure that the

844
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,300
monopolies didn't harm consumers by

845
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,340
raising prices and under Reagan and his

846
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,100
successors antitrust has been dismantled

847
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,220
all around the world in living memory

848
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,530
right in the time that I've been alive

849
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,000
it was once illegal for companies to

850
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,660
grow by merging with their largest

851
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,180
rivals

852
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,710
it was once illegal by companies to be

853
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,540
verdant for companies to be vertically

854
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,580
integrated right for a company to own

855
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,470
both a railroad and a freight shipping

856
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,879
company you could either run run the

857
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,980
railroad or you could ship the freight

858
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,350
the railroad carried but not both and

859
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,240
companies were not allowed to buy Grob

860
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm buying up there they're emergent

861
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,000
competitors well in the last six months

862
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,820
Apple bought 20 to 25 small companies it

863
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,710
does that every six months it buys

864
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:02,700
companies more often than I buy

865
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:04,200
groceries now today we're asked to

866
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,150
believe that something has changed in

867
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,160
our technology that makes monopolies

868
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,860
inevitable that it's to do with tech and

869
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,630
not with law but every one of these

870
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,340
monopolist grew by doing things that

871
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,340
were radioactively illegal under

872
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,800
antitrust law think about Google apart

873
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,570
from two products search and Gmail

874
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,830
Google has not had one significant new

875
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,939
product that they've been able to launch

876
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,009
internally

877
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,570
everything else they do they do because

878
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:30,679
they bought another company that had

879
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,240
been founded or think about Facebook

880
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,490
Facebook tells advertisers that it spies

881
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,919
on us so much that it can tell exactly

882
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,690
what we're going to do and that it can

883
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,279
use its machine learning systems to

884
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,649
convince us of anything an advertiser

885
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,879
wants us to believe Facebook tells us

886
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:46,258
that they've built a machine learning

887
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:49,230
mind control ray

888
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,929
but what Facebook really has is detailed

889
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:54,240
non-consensual dossiers on 2.3 billion

890
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:57,149
people around the world and it can use

891
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,649
those dossiers to profile us and target

892
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,239
us so if you're trying to locate

893
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,529
something with a very hard-to-find trait

894
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,789
like somebody who wants to buy a

895
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:04,950
refrigerator right which is something

896
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:06,629
most of us will never do I think the

897
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:08,220
median person buys like one point two

898
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:10,980
four refrigerators in their whole life

899
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,598
then you can ask Facebook for people who

900
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,520
searched on refrigerators who bought a

901
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,230
house recently who have some money in

902
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,359
the bank and it will let you advertise

903
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,710
refrigerators to them and instead of the

904
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,540
success rate you get when you advertise

905
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,168
a refrigerator on a billboard on the

906
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,149
motorway which is like 0.00001%

907
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:30,290
you will get Facebook's much improved

908
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,730
success rate which is like 0.001 percent

909
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,859
right and that's orders of magnitude

910
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,490
more efficient but it's hardly a mind

911
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:40,139
control ray and now benefits Facebook to

912
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,359
argue that it actually has a mind

913
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,790
control ray people want to buy facebook

914
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:47,069
services because people want to buy mind

915
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,109
control rays companies like Cambridge

916
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,069
analytic told us that they they figured

917
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,409
out how to perfect

918
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:53,699
Facebook's mind control ray right that

919
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,619
they figured out how to point the mind

920
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,040
control ray at decent people and make

921
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,750
them into Trump voters and brexit voters

922
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,880
but it isn't it more likely that what

923
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,430
they did was use these profiles to find

924
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,089
racists and convince them that Trump and

925
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,009
Briggs it would be what they wanted we

926
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,589
know that every claim that Facebook

927
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:16,020
makes is a lie don't take my word for it

928
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,310
that's what the Secretary of State for

929
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,630
New Zealand said in Parliament last

930
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:23,220
month so why do we believe that they're

931
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,349
telling the truth in their sales

932
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,779
literature when they promised us that

933
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:30,480
their product works really really well

934
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,250
and even when you see a Facebook like

935
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,230
company that manages to change our

936
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,640
behavior in these great big ways what we

937
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,650
find is that very quickly they regress

938
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,450
to the mean I remember the great

939
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,100
vil apocalypse when everyone I knew

940
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,870
disappeared into farmville and didn't

941
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,660
emerge for three months but then they

942
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,509
did right because most of us get in nerd

943
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,040
to stimulus over time we stopped

944
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,240
noticing at it we get we get a callus

945
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,950
over our attention

946
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,720
some people don't that's why there are

947
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,060
people in the casino wearing adult

948
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,319
diapers spending their children's

949
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,259
college savings on the slot machine

950
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,970
right but most people do and it's very

951
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,700
hard to build a business as low margin

952
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,410
as Zynga out of out of that tiny rump of

953
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,750
people who remain vulnerable after the

954
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,160
initial rush which is why Zynga with all

955
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,140
of the money that they made from farival

956
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,879
never managed to replicate farmville

957
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,850
success there is a farmville too but no

958
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,440
one's played it now users don't like

959
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,150
Facebook but they also can't escape

960
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,130
Facebook because it holds their friends

961
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,200
hostage and even when they want to leave

962
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,990
Facebook there's nowhere else to go 15

963
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,620
million Americans aged 13 to 34 quit

964
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:33,870
Facebook last year and went to Instagram

965
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,970
there's a company owned by Facebook now

966
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,640
that whole Instagram story it's like a

967
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:41,220
fairy tale about why we shouldn't have

968
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,960
screwed up antitrust law a few of us

969
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,149
remember this but for the first 10 years

970
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,550
that Facebook was in existence it billed

971
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,460
itself as the pro privacy alternative to

972
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,170
MySpace and to Orca they said we have to

973
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,390
have a walled garden otherwise these bad

974
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,670
actors will ingest your data and use it

975
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:58,170
to target you with advertising the first

976
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,210
time they released a targeted

977
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,100
advertising product the beacon they

978
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,290
issued a groveling apology and promised

979
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:08,130
they would never target us or surveil us

980
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:11,130
or profile us again but each time one of

981
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:14,070
its competitors died Facebook expanded

982
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,960
its surveillance and each time it did it

983
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,890
took a beating in the public sphere and

984
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,600
roll back

985
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,730
but to a place that was surveilling more

986
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,900
than it was when the last competitor

987
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:28,110
died Facebook dominance is near total

988
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,760
but but market is very lucrative right

989
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,870
when you have 2.3 billion users you've

990
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,060
got a big target on your back

991
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,560
and so there are lots of companies that

992
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,420
would love to try and take aim at them

993
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,640
there's only one of them that's really

994
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,770
made a go of it and it's a company whose

995
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,750
whole pitch is we're like Facebook but

996
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,580
were more Pro privacy and everything you

997
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,060
post to us disappears before anyone can

998
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,370
mine it

999
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,990
they're called snapchat right snapchat

1000
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,118
is the only competitor that Facebook has

1001
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,828
that has managed to survive Facebook

1002
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,049
and it shows you that what people want

1003
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:56,940
is a place with their friends and not

1004
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:59,460
spying right that's why that's why

1005
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,440
snapchat has been so successful people

1006
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,259
left Facebook by the millions to join

1007
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,880
snapchat so what did Facebook do well

1008
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:08,009
Facebook had bought a spyware company

1009
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,779
called au niveau Innova originally made

1010
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:12,089
a product that it deceptively described

1011
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:13,289
as a battery monitor what it did was

1012
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,900
spying on everything you do with the

1013
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:17,880
phone later on o novo morphed into a VPN

1014
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,859
that also spied on everything you did

1015
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,859
with the phone it used that to surveil

1016
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,229
how people were using snapchat and to

1017
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,029
identify that acquiring Instagram would

1018
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:29,160
be a good hedge against the departures

1019
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:31,829
for snapchat and then it used it to

1020
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,868
refine instagrams features based on what

1021
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:35,579
former Facebook users who had a novel

1022
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:39,869
installed on their phone we're doing

1023
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:42,829
with snapchat so today despite a market

1024
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:46,440
hungry for privacy we have no privacy

1025
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:48,690
social network Facebook owns the users

1026
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,009
it's not going to let them out when

1027
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,450
Facebook started the majority of

1028
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:53,069
Facebook users were actually our

1029
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,229
potential Facebook users were on a rival

1030
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,700
service called MySpace and of course

1031
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,319
although you might have liked Facebook's

1032
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,819
features better the only reason to have

1033
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:01,469
those features is so you could use them

1034
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:02,880
to talk to your friends and if your

1035
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:04,799
friends are on MySpace you couldn't

1036
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,380
leave so space Facebook had a really

1037
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:09,269
clever solution they made a tool that

1038
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,739
would log in to MySpace and pretend to

1039
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:12,808
be you you could give it your login

1040
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:14,670
credentials it would log into MySpace

1041
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,799
fetch the message is waiting for you put

1042
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,599
them in your facebook inbox let you

1043
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,920
reply to them send them back to myspace

1044
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,420
with the footer that says I sent this

1045
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,569
from Facebook why are you still using

1046
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,219
MySpace right so that worked great

1047
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,140
Facebook grew to dominance myspace

1048
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:29,670
withered and then Along Came a company

1049
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,140
to do to Facebook what Facebook have

1050
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,700
done to myspace called power ventures

1051
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,529
they would take your waiting Facebook

1052
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,910
messages put them in an inbox with your

1053
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:37,769
other waiting messages from all your

1054
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,149
other social telephones let you reply to

1055
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:41,819
them in one place and send them back out

1056
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,920
again and Facebook sue them under an

1057
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:45,538
ancient ronald reagan era law called the

1058
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,249
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act they

1059
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:48,719
proposed a radical new theory Evette

1060
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:50,249
they paid a lot of money for legal

1061
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,319
services to support that theory

1062
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:54,359
they put power ventures out of business

1063
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:58,759
and now no one can do to Facebook what

1064
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:01,288
Facebook did to MySpace Facebook is a

1065
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:03,960
behavioral modification device for sure

1066
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:05,880
but it only has one trick up its sleeve

1067
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,319
all it can do is make you look at

1068
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,730
Facebook and the way that it makes you

1069
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,558
look at Facebook is that that's where

1070
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,910
all your friends are and so you want to

1071
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:12,930
let you want to talk to your friends and

1072
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,700
so you have to take your phone out of

1073
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,520
your pocket over and over again to see

1074
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,770
what your friends are doing and it it

1075
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,990
derives so it derives that by hijacking

1076
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,940
our social relationships and then

1077
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,770
Facebook has this targeting system that

1078
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,599
works better than untargeted ads but

1079
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,609
still performs very badly it has to show

1080
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,349
you a lot of ads before one of them

1081
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,240
regenerates a click that generates a

1082
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:34,410
sale for its advertisers and the thing

1083
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,879
is that you and your friends just don't

1084
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:39,868
have enough to talk about on their own

1085
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,079
so it has a M it has a an engagement

1086
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:44,160
maximization algorithm which in 2019 is

1087
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,869
a fancy way of saying that they

1088
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,970
non-consensual e eyeball you with

1089
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,260
Trump headlines all day so that you get

1090
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,848
into horrible arguments with your

1091
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,039
friends and generate more clicks right

1092
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,410
so Facebook also is an emotion control

1093
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,380
ray but all it can do is make you angry

1094
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:59,490
and so you sit there being angry wishing

1095
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,720
you could talk to your friends then

1096
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,279
getting angry and in the meanwhile

1097
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,689
you're seeing refrigerator ads and if

1098
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:05,369
the refrigerator ads work one in a

1099
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,750
million times and they can get you to

1100
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:13,859
click a million times they'll sell one

1101
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:16,920
refrigerator so this is the tragedy

1102
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:18,990
right we're being spied on and put to

1103
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,640
such enormous personal risk not because

1104
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,729
it works so well but because it hardly

1105
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,470
risks it hardly works rather the reason

1106
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,710
Facebook has to keep coming up with new

1107
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,450
ways to spy on us is because the each

1108
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,309
way that it finds to influence our

1109
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:35,368
behavior we quickly become inured to

1110
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:37,049
right it has so little use for our data

1111
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,000
that it needs to aggregate giant

1112
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:41,849
mountains of it to get even the tiniest

1113
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,609
behavioral effect out of us we are being

1114
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:48,029
sold down the river not for millions but

1115
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,380
for pennies now big tech apologists they

1116
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:50,760
say the reason the industry is

1117
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,470
concentrated is because tech is

1118
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,480
different I don't know about you but it

1119
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,669
sure sounds to me like if you take away

1120
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,869
anti-monopoly protections and then

1121
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,640
companies do the things that those

1122
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:02,039
protections used to prohibit and then

1123
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,150
they turn into monopolies that maybe the

1124
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,520
answer was that the anti-monopoly

1125
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:08,039
protections were working and not that

1126
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,380
first mover advantage and network

1127
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,000
effects and global markets have suddenly

1128
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,660
changed the fundamental laws of

1129
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,650
economics now I think that maybe we

1130
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,509
could try giving those old

1131
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,890
Ragan Prix Helmut Kohl Prix Margaret

1132
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,710
Thatcher tools ago maybe we could start

1133
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,808
breaking up the platforms for one thing

1134
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,339
if Facebook was a lot smaller than the

1135
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,349
stupid mistakes it made wouldn't be

1136
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:30,788
nearly so consequential there wouldn't

1137
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:33,160
be one place that you could go to to

1138
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:36,670
stream your terrorist atrocity footage

1139
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,410
and reach 2.3 billion people now some

1140
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:40,390
people they say that Facebook isn't just

1141
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,098
the place that you go to if you want to

1142
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,629
stream your terrorist videos it's also

1143
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:45,880
the place you go to if you want to turn

1144
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:48,130
other people into terrorists and there

1145
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,750
is some truth to that between engagement

1146
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,400
algorithms that increase pageviews and

1147
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,740
revenues by showing users controversial

1148
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,930
material and the ability to target users

1149
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,470
who are receptive to messages of hate

1150
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:01,240
speech and and and extremism the

1151
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,279
platform's make it easier than ever to

1152
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,649
recruit people into extremist movements

1153
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:07,960
but a Facebook is a people funding

1154
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,640
system and not a mind control ray then

1155
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,470
we should be asking yourself why are

1156
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,808
there so many people there to be found

1157
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:18,038
who are vulnerable to messages of

1158
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:20,650
extremist radicalization from anti VAX

1159
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:22,569
to the Flat Earth movement and I think

1160
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,150
to understand this we also have to think

1161
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:27,430
about Ronald Reagan 40 years of

1162
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:30,609
neoliberal policies has made the richest

1163
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:33,368
among us so much richer and everyone

1164
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:35,170
else so much poorer and one of the

1165
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:36,789
results of this is that our institutions

1166
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:39,039
no longer operate on the basis of

1167
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:41,470
evidence rather they operate to enrich

1168
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,569
the highest bidder so when you have a

1169
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,160
truth finding exercise to establish the

1170
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:47,829
link between tobacco and cancer or

1171
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,319
carbon and climate change or opioids an

1172
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:52,539
addiction or the copyright directive and

1173
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,009
filters it's not paranoid or

1174
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:55,569
conspiratorial to say that the reason

1175
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:58,240
that the conclusion that our governments

1176
00:43:55,569 --> 00:44:00,700
reach over and over again are seems so

1177
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,919
wrong is because the people we are

1178
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,210
paying to collect evidence are in the

1179
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,640
pocket of the people they're supposed to

1180
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:08,650
be acting as watchdogs over and this

1181
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,230
creates a kind of breakdown what I call

1182
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,000
the epistemological crisis it's not that

1183
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,460
we no longer agree on what's true it's

1184
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,680
that we no longer agree on how we know

1185
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,029
whether something is true or not so

1186
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:24,129
think for a moment at the anti-vaxxer

1187
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:26,440
love to say as the anti-vaxxers do that

1188
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,299
big pharma is giant and concentrated and

1189
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,589
ruthless and willing to murder the

1190
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,569
people that it's supposed to be helping

1191
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:33,308
if it makes more money for the company

1192
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,930
if you need evidence of that just look

1193
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:37,299
at Purdue Pharma and the other opioid

1194
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,910
vendors who spent a decade insisting

1195
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,829
that their products like like fentanyl

1196
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:43,479
and oxycontin were not dangerous not

1197
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:45,309
addictive that we were under treating

1198
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:47,160
pain and that doctors should be writing

1199
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:49,119
more prescriptions while they were

1200
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,979
bribing doctors to write those

1201
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,719
prescriptions kicking off an opioid

1202
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,629
epidemic that has killed people all over

1203
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:57,099
the world and in America it's killed

1204
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,229
200,000 people more Americans that were

1205
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:01,239
killed during the Vietnam War so it's

1206
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:03,249
not foolish to say why should we trust

1207
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,869
the Firma companies it's also not

1208
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:06,640
foolish to say that the regulator's are

1209
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,499
letting them get away with murder after

1210
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,379
all when an industry only has four or

1211
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:13,209
five companies in it than anyone

1212
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,009
qualified to regulate them is probably

1213
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:17,440
drawn from the executive suite of those

1214
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:19,209
companies you know the last FCC chairman

1215
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,880
in the United States the good one that

1216
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:24,759
Obama appointed Comcast lobbyists right

1217
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,729
the new FCC FCC chairman the bad one the

1218
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:29,589
Trump appointed Verizon lobbyist right

1219
00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:31,930
there are no people who are going to end

1220
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:33,190
up in that seat who aren't an executive

1221
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,180
at one of those companies and anyone

1222
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,920
who's an executive at one of those

1223
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,479
companies probably worked at two or

1224
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,619
three of the other ones and is married

1225
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:42,848
to someone who worked at the remaining

1226
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:44,739
two so it's in arguable that pharma

1227
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:45,999
companies are corrupt and that the

1228
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:47,920
regulators are letting them get away

1229
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:49,959
with murder so it's not unreasonable to

1230
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,729
reach the conclusion that we can't trust

1231
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:53,169
either them or the regulators when they

1232
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:54,968
tell us that their products are unsafe

1233
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,859
now I happen to think I haven't done

1234
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:58,569
know that vaccines are safe vaccines are

1235
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:01,509
safe vaccinate your kids vaccinate your

1236
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:03,339
self but and I have though I happen to

1237
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:06,670
disagree with them on their conclusion

1238
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:08,440
their logic is hard to fault in the 21st

1239
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,509
century people look to conspiracies to

1240
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,069
explain the facts around them because so

1241
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:15,339
much of the bad stuff around them is the

1242
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:18,279
result of a conspiracy whether that's

1243
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:20,229
Exxon covering up its own research that

1244
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:22,239
said that its products were contributing

1245
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:23,919
to climate change and would make our

1246
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,349
planet incapable of supporting human

1247
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,940
life or the NSA wiretapping the whole

1248
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:29,559
world's Internet and with the

1249
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,509
cooperation of big tech companies who

1250
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,479
swore it wasn't happening these

1251
00:46:31,509 --> 00:46:36,130
conspiracies don't come cheap the

1252
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:37,779
authorities that help them along with

1253
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:40,209
their conspiracies they expect handsome

1254
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:42,849
rewards jobs and industry campaign

1255
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:44,558
contributions and this is the sort of

1256
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:44,990
thing that you can only pull off in a

1257
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,030
new

1258
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,950
at age where wealth and power have been

1259
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,510
concentrated and where industries have

1260
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,270
concentrated along with them

1261
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:56,810
we won't make conspiracies implausible

1262
00:46:53,270 --> 00:47:01,400
until we get rid of conspiracies and we

1263
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:02,840
can't do that until we thank you we

1264
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,170
can't do that until we tackle wealth

1265
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,510
inequality if we punish the platforms

1266
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,250
for their monopolistic abuses by

1267
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:12,650
imposing new duties on them that

1268
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,930
normally states would perform duties to

1269
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,570
monitor and filter their users we just

1270
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:19,640
cement their dominance once we dreamed

1271
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:21,170
of an internet that was democratic where

1272
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,940
we would all get a say in its future

1273
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:26,210
where anyone could make an Internet tool

1274
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:28,250
and it would exist as a peer among all

1275
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:30,410
the other Internet tools on the Internet

1276
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,300
but if we invest platforms with

1277
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:34,490
state-like roles in exchange for letting

1278
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,350
them grow to be so big that we could

1279
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,790
never break them up because if we broke

1280
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,589
them up they would be too small to

1281
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,230
enforce the Terra regulation to enforce

1282
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:44,360
esta FASTA to enforce article 13 and the

1283
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,820
copyright directive then we are ending

1284
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,520
democracy and we're putting in place a

1285
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,710
constitutional monarchy where Gotham get

1286
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,109
to rule forever with the Divine Right of

1287
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,690
Kings and their power is only checked by

1288
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:59,270
an aristocracy of regulators drawn from

1289
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:02,450
their executive suite who asked them to

1290
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:04,250
kindly Don golden chains and restrain

1291
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:07,029
themselves through a sense of noblesse

1292
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,030
oblige a

1293
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:16,098
thank you we can have a pluralistic

1294
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,619
Internet made up of small companies and

1295
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:20,750
coops that serve their users or we can

1296
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:23,420
deputize big tech to perform state-like

1297
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,280
duties but we can't have both that's why

1298
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,960
it's so dangerous to hear people saying

1299
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,390
things like if you're not paying for the

1300
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,010
product you are the product if you go

1301
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,710
out and spend a thousand dollars on an

1302
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:37,250
iPhone Apple will use the

1303
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,869
anti-circumvention rules to make and to

1304
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,970
make sure that you only get your device

1305
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:43,190
fixed by them and that you only buy apps

1306
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,319
from them so they can take 30% out of

1307
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,030
every sale and then they will use the

1308
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,099
money that they get from that to fight

1309
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:51,349
and kill right to repair laws all around

1310
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,970
the world including in the EU and most

1311
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:55,310
recently in Ontario where I'm from

1312
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,200
because in a monopoly even if you're

1313
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,509
paying for the product you are still the

1314
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,220
product Google makes money by spying on

1315
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,290
you Apple makes money by locking you in

1316
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,720
Facebook makes money by locking you in

1317
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,700
and by spying on you right

1318
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,049
adding price tags to today's free

1319
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,970
services will not make them more

1320
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,349
democratic or accountable and if we are

1321
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,629
living under conditions of gross

1322
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:16,700
inequality then making someone's ability

1323
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:18,920
to participate in culture contingent on

1324
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,640
their ability to pay will not produce a

1325
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,540
more democratic or pluralistic society

1326
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,779
here's what I'm trying to say

1327
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:29,089
techno exceptionalism is garbage Tek is

1328
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,190
rotten not because there's something

1329
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:33,230
intrinsically rotten about tech but

1330
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:36,200
because everything is rotten and tech

1331
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:38,420
grew up in lockstep with the rot the

1332
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,520
only way to make big tech better is to

1333
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,260
make it smaller to break up the

1334
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,849
monopolies to ban the practice of

1335
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,710
growing by merging and acquiring your

1336
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:48,470
nascent competitors to crack down on

1337
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:51,470
vertical integration this has been a

1338
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:53,450
hell of a year for the internet and for

1339
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:55,490
our planet and for our species and we

1340
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:58,220
have some major challenges ahead of us

1341
00:49:55,490 --> 00:50:00,919
climate change misogyny white

1342
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,660
nationalism and while I'm skeptical of

1343
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,940
the tech exceptionalism that says that

1344
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,220
we have these exotic causes that have

1345
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,599
caused tech to be concentrated I am a

1346
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,310
tech Exceptionalist in one regard

1347
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,780
because I don't believe that the

1348
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:15,230
Internet is what we fight for but I

1349
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:18,650
believe it's what we fight with the

1350
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:20,300
Internet the Internet is the terrain on

1351
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,849
which every battle that's coming will be

1352
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,930
fought on to win or lose and if we lose

1353
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:25,690
the Internet we

1354
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:28,250
lose those battles before they're fought

1355
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,620
we are very vote focused today on what

1356
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,940
technology does but if we really want to

1357
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,250
solve the problems of tech we should be

1358
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:37,280
focused on what it does them to and who

1359
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:39,200
it does them for we once dreamed of a

1360
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,300
democratic tech future we once taught

1361
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,919
kids stem not so they'd be ready for the

1362
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,110
job market but so that they could have

1363
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,280
technological self-defense so that they

1364
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,950
could program so they wouldn't be

1365
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:51,140
programmed and a democratic anti

1366
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:53,569
oligarchic technological future is still

1367
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,060
possible if we seize the means of

1368
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,920
computation and use it to organize and

1369
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,160
demand a future where we are neither

1370
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,530
spied upon nor locked in a future where

1371
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,120
technology sets us free and never puts

1372
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,120
us in Chains thank you

1373
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,630
Thanks so thank you

1374
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,810
Thanks

1375
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:27,030
so thank you we have about eight minutes

1376
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,530
for questions I like to call alternately

1377
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,299
on people identify as women and

1378
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:32,220
non-binary and then people identify as

1379
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:33,420
male or non-binary and usually when I

1380
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,950
say that there's like kind of a pause

1381
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,450
because speaking as a man I can tell you

1382
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:37,348
that a great plurality of the men have

1383
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,730
been spending a great deal of the time

1384
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:39,990
thinking up a cool question that will

1385
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,089
make them sound smart and the women have

1386
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:44,129
been paying attention but sometimes if I

1387
00:51:42,089 --> 00:51:45,480
tell that joke enough time will have

1388
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,980
gone by that a woman or someone who

1389
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,180
identifies as non-binary has thought of

1390
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:49,500
a question so if there's someone who

1391
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,879
fits that description who'd like to ask

1392
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,020
the first question if you could raise

1393
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,710
your hand we have a mic runner

1394
00:51:52,020 --> 00:52:00,119
I can also vamp for awhile before we get

1395
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,829
to it if someone wants to think of a

1396
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,530
question do we have in there all right

1397
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:07,289
thank you hi hi what are the best

1398
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:10,020
options for the elections of Parliament

1399
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:11,400
in Europe to help us with this problems

1400
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,470
what are the best options for the

1401
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,730
parliamentary elections in Europe that

1402
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:17,220
is a really good question who should we

1403
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:20,789
vote for yeah I don't know who to vote

1404
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,169
for I spoke with a colleague today who

1405
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:24,089
said that you should ask anyone who

1406
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,740
wants your vote whether they will refer

1407
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:28,440
the copyright directive to the European

1408
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,700
Court of Justice for a judgement on its

1409
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,910
constitutionality I think that's

1410
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:35,430
probably a good heuristic anyway you

1411
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,440
know thank you and I just I I vote in

1412
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:39,899
the UK by proxy so I just instructed my

1413
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,339
proxy on who to vote for and my votes

1414
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,859
going for the slate that's been put

1415
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:47,180
forward by extinction rebellion for

1416
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:49,770
whatever that's worth yeah yes ma'am

1417
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,538
thanks for inspiring talk so I'm

1418
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:54,509
following up on the last thing you said

1419
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:57,260
race the means of computation yeah so am

1420
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:59,339
I dreaming of a sort of

1421
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,910
anarcho-syndicalism or are you more

1422
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:06,359
dreaming of a regulated capitalism so I

1423
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:09,299
think that um our approach to how we

1424
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:12,328
should run our society should be on an

1425
00:53:09,299 --> 00:53:13,619
evidentiary footing right so so I think

1426
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:15,809
the question you're asking is what's

1427
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,970
best and I don't know what's best but I

1428
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:19,319
know how we find out what's best right

1429
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,180
so this is a bit like the scientific

1430
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,839
method right with the scientific method

1431
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,460
we say not what is true but how do we

1432
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,880
find out what's true and the way we find

1433
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:33,140
out what's true is by having pluralistic

1434
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:35,730
rigorous and accountable truth seeking

1435
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:39,270
systems of governance and the

1436
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:42,450
precondition for it for an accurate and

1437
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,400
and accountable truth seeking exercise

1438
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:46,529
is that there can't be one player in the

1439
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,960
room that when they speak everyone else

1440
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:51,240
has to listen to them because they will

1441
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,610
always clobber the truth because the

1442
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,979
truth is always antithetical to the

1443
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:59,850
parochial goals of any one giant player

1444
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,980
because and so my my my goal is first

1445
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,150
what we need to have is pluralism so we

1446
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,650
need to have pluralism and wealth

1447
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,770
distribution we need to have pluralism

1448
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:10,260
and Industry right and from there are

1449
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,450
our regulatory apparatus will once again

1450
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,920
be able to establish different answers

1451
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,509
to different questions when do we need

1452
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,160
markets when do we use planning and so

1453
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,870
on but we can't hope to answer those

1454
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,850
questions unless we have a rigorous

1455
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:22,650
process so it's it's it's as though

1456
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,540
we've reverted to the days of alchemy

1457
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:27,240
right and the days of alchemy no one

1458
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,250
exposed their conclusions to rigorous

1459
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,379
review by third parties who disagreed

1460
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,960
with them and so every alchemist drank

1461
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,700
mercury right because no one ever told

1462
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,710
them that I think your evidence is poor

1463
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,540
because they never had to be accountable

1464
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:41,250
to an outside source and right now we

1465
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,200
have like that we have very close

1466
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,940
equivalents in our policy sphere you

1467
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,460
know I think that anyone who says you

1468
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,900
know as Justin Trudeau did that Canada

1469
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,640
should continue to burn the the

1470
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,500
filthiest oil on earth that tar sands

1471
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,210
because quote no country is going to

1472
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,100
leave two billion dollars two trillion

1473
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,290
dollars worth of tar of coal in the or

1474
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,910
oil in the ground right that that's

1475
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,700
that's just drinking mercury for the

1476
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:04,980
planet in in West Virginia where Dow

1477
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,020
Chemical is the largest player in the

1478
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,090
largest industry chemical processing

1479
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,240
they they just had an evidentiary

1480
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:15,150
hearing on whether the national levels

1481
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,060
for a chemical runoff in the water

1482
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:20,280
should be made more relaxed in West

1483
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,790
Virginia which obviously they shouldn't

1484
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,950
and and Dow presented evidence and they

1485
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:27,450
said if they should be because the

1486
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,279
national levels are set based on the

1487
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,290
average body mass index of the average

1488
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,450
American and in West Virginia there's so

1489
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:35,820
much fatter that we can poison them more

1490
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,080
before they get sick right so this is

1491
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,090
what you get when the evidentiary

1492
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,950
process is dominated by a single player

1493
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,720
right like that's just you know like

1494
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:44,250
basically doubt someone handed someone

1495
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,870
at Dow Chemical a piece of paper and

1496
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,940
there was a like you are going to get

1497
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,069
your goal if you write anything in this

1498
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,920
box that says reason and they sort of

1499
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:54,630
you know drank some whiskey and came up

1500
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,910
with the reason West Virginians are fat

1501
00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:00,440
right give us our give us our chemical

1502
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:03,600
runoff regime and so I I think that like

1503
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,200
presupposing the answer is is it's it's

1504
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,970
ahead of it's ahead of the the it's

1505
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,649
premature right that what we should have

1506
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,990
first is a mechanism that reliably

1507
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,160
produces good pluralistic answers that

1508
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:16,680
have the consent of the governed and

1509
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,529
have legitimacy and then we'll figure

1510
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,390
out whether or not we are you know

1511
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:26,300
living in anarcho-syndicalist society or

1512
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:26,299
whatever thank you

1513
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,460
hi question relating to New Zealand

1514
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:39,250
where I'm from yeah and you mentioned

1515
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,590
that there's been a big push back after

1516
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,060
the white nationalist attacks and the

1517
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:46,060
prime minister of New Zealand Jason

1518
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:49,350
Durden and emanuelle micron from France

1519
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:52,509
are hosting a summit next Wednesday to

1520
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:55,779
develop regulation what would be an

1521
00:56:52,510 --> 00:57:00,970
ideal outcome from your perspective for

1522
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:05,080
that summit so I think that um anything

1523
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:07,180
that we do to regulate Facebook per se

1524
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,890
right to say okay well you're gonna have

1525
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,540
a platform and 2.3 billion people are

1526
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:13,029
gonna speak on it and it's gonna be the

1527
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,860
only place in which you can really like

1528
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,780
form communities and mobilize people to

1529
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,180
action but you're also gonna have a duty

1530
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,100
to police your speech the speech of all

1531
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,529
those users anything that we say is just

1532
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,210
gonna work out very badly I think of

1533
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,580
anything the fact that there's one place

1534
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:31,630
where if you livestream your your

1535
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:35,170
atrocity everyone can see it tells you

1536
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:37,540
that that the answer has to be that

1537
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,010
there shouldn't be a centralized locus

1538
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:42,520
of power the way that facebook has

1539
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:44,230
become you know that that if we can

1540
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,690
tinker around the margins by imposing

1541
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,310
duties on Facebook the likely outcome of

1542
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,780
that is that those duties will put a

1543
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,600
floor under how small we can make

1544
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,100
Facebook in the future and the streaming

1545
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,529
of the white nationalist attack is one

1546
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,330
of many ways in which Facebook and its

1547
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:00,940
dominance has proven to be very toxic

1548
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:03,210
and if we can't split Facebook up and

1549
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,470
make it non dominant in the future then

1550
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,420
we're going to get into all kinds of

1551
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,160
trouble in all kinds of ways so I think

1552
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,710
a lot about the example of Cambodia

1553
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,180
where Facebook is the de-facto way that

1554
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:16,540
you communicate with other Cambodians

1555
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:18,819
and in Cambodia the dictator the

1556
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,590
autocrat nearly lost an election in 2013

1557
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,780
because the opposition movement used

1558
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:24,190
Facebook to mobilize voters and a

1559
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,370
political opposition for the first time

1560
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,340
in living memory and as a response he

1561
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:31,750
hired a bunch of Facebook consultants

1562
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:34,090
Facebook is still the only place that

1563
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,950
Cambodians can talk to one another but

1564
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:38,590
because Facebook has all of these

1565
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:40,899
policies in place he is able to use

1566
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,020
Facebook to cement his dominance so if

1567
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,970
your

1568
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:47,420
from the Cambodian diaspora and you live

1569
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:49,368
abroad he has paid trolls that will go

1570
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,500
Jew into crossing the hate speech lines

1571
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:53,930
that Facebook has established to stop

1572
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,520
people from from harassment and so on so

1573
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,290
they'll draw you across the line while

1574
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,000
standing on the line themselves because

1575
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,800
their Facebook policy experts and you're

1576
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,660
not you're a Cambodian dissident living

1577
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,280
in exile and so he gets those people

1578
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,440
kicked off if you're a Facebook user

1579
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:09,440
living in our Cambodian Facebook user

1580
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,570
living in Cambodia and you oppose the

1581
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,640
government and you don't use your real

1582
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:14,780
name he'll get you kicked off Facebook

1583
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,940
for not using your real name because

1584
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,110
that's also a Facebook policy and if

1585
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,430
you're on Facebook and you're in

1586
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:20,480
Cambodia and you're using your real name

1587
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,250
and you're opposing the government

1588
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,430
government he'll have you arrested and

1589
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:27,200
so the only answer to this is not to

1590
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,910
like make more baroque rules for

1591
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,980
Facebook and how it moderates content

1592
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,080
the answer is to make Facebook's content

1593
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,180
moderation decisions less consequential

1594
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,369
we need to have lots of places where

1595
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,440
people can talk and gather because for

1596
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:41,240
so long as power is concentrated into

1597
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,250
Facebook's hands they will be incapable

1598
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,500
of using it wisely right the reason that

1599
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,020
Facebook is is incompetent when it comes

1600
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:51,230
to managing 2.5 billion users personal

1601
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,119
lives is not because they're idiots they

1602
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,040
hire some really smart people it's

1603
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,359
because there is no one who is smart

1604
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,190
enough and there will never be someone

1605
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:00,380
who's smart enough to manage the social

1606
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,640
lives of 2.5 billion people it's an

1607
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,290
impossible task that they've set for

1608
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,359
themselves and the only reason that

1609
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:07,700
they're able to allow able to go on

1610
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,080
doing it is because of monopolies and so

1611
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,109
I know it's unrealistic right because

1612
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,240
people want solutions not not

1613
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:17,330
identification of root causes but you

1614
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:21,020
know if you show up and you say you know

1615
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:23,270
I've got a real problem with my with my

1616
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,650
house and it's sinking and what can I do

1617
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:26,210
and I say well it's because it's on a

1618
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,680
sinkhole you're gonna have to move and

1619
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,150
you say no no you there must be

1620
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,609
something I can do with the foundation

1621
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,840
to fix it anything that we do is just

1622
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:34,250
going to result in its sinking again

1623
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,050
next year and next year and next and

1624
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,030
we're just gonna build up policy debt so

1625
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:39,619
I think the only answer is that we have

1626
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,570
to make Facebook smaller so that the bad

1627
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:43,640
decisions that Facebook makes it's its

1628
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,680
inability to identify that that stream

1629
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,720
are less consequential and we're out of

1630
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,470
time thank you very much

1631
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,470
thank you

1632
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,819
thank you very much

1633
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:11,730
