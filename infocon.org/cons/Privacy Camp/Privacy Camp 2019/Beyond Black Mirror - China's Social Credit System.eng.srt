[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
a

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
[Music]

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:28,849
holy people are really interested

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:32,698
in the social credit system look at that

7
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,980
I we just have an hour and I actually

8
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:37,410
want to get to question and answer as

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,839
quickly as possible I suspect with such

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,300
a crowd that there will be a lot of

11
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:44,430
people with questions let me first

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,319
introduce myself I'm the moderator my

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,129
name is Melissa Chan I live and work in

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,409
Berlin and work on a variety of projects

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,649
as a journalist this is my base I go

16
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:58,289
around the world and I was based in Asia

17
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,219
for almost a decade five years in

18
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,720
Beijing as correspondent for Al Jazeera

19
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:07,920
and continue to keep tabs on the country

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,929
particularly its growing influence in

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,229
the world the title of this talk is

22
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:20,580
debunking myths around China's social

23
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,610
credit score and the social credit score

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,830
has been described as everything from

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,229
digital dictatorship to sign some kind

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,920
of like dystopian episode of Black

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:35,250
Mirror if you don't behave and there are

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,069
many ways you can misbehave supposedly

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,310
from jaywalking or having the wrong

30
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:44,190
political views you will supposedly be

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,800
penalized there was a headline you might

32
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,380
have seen about millions of people being

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,009
on a blacklist where they cannot

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,259
participate in air travel but as our

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,890
panelists will explain with much greater

36
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,920
knowledge it is less comprehensive and

37
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,910
less a national than you might think

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,009
some would argue it's less about

39
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,869
blacklist and actually more about

40
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,818
building trust and if you've ever been

41
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,150
to China or have spent time in China you

42
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,488
know that trust is a serious issue

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,709
building trust between people to people

44
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:20,819
and also people to organizations and

45
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,830
companies before I introduce our

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,290
panelists I want to emphasize though

47
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,319
because this thought occurred to me as I

48
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,790
was looking at the title debunking myths

49
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,060
I don't want to give the impression that

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,569
keeping track of people and keeping

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,099
acquiring digital data about people is

52
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:45,319
okay we are going to try to debunk myths

53
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,988
but that doesn't mean that this social

54
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,089
credit system cannot create a lot of

55
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,380
harm and it doesn't mean that the social

56
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,390
credit system is not problematic in fact

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,359
it could cause a lot of harm and could

58
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,339
be very problematic indeed so let's just

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,739
keep that in mind with that out of the

60
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,150
way our guests - uh well actually I'm

61
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:12,799
gonna hold off on Kaiser I'm gonna

62
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:15,140
introduce you last but jeremy dom here

63
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,390
is senior fellow of the Yale Law School

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,760
Paul tied China Center he's based in

65
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,859
Beijing and he looks at Chinese legal

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,170
reform with a focus on Criminal

67
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,690
Procedure law he runs this website

68
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,700
called China law translate comm which is

69
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,250
a really incredible resource I highly

70
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,709
recommend that you check it out there's

71
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,660
not a single foreign journalist covering

72
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,599
China that does not go to that website

73
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,260
as a primary source I can tell you the

74
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,530
New York Times journalists all do next

75
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,989
is Gannett Kostka who is here based in

76
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,310
Berlin at the fie University Ted she is

77
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,620
a professor of Chinese politics looks at

78
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,620
digital transformation among many other

79
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,720
things and she is on this panel for a

80
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,880
variety of reasons but because of her

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,389
most recent study it's very fascinating

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,620
she did public opinion polling in China

83
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:13,569
on social credit and then in the blue is

84
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:17,478
Manya Cutts a-- who is editor-in-chief

85
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:20,358
of a website called what's on Weibo she

86
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:22,610
follows social media and China looks at

87
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,219
digital developments and cyber culture

88
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,370
there and she's really been taking a

89
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,430
close look at the social credit system

90
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,289
and what Chinese

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,200
online are saying about it and thinking

92
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:38,450
about it last but not least is Kaiser

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,729
Kuo I hold that off because the last

94
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,260
time I saw Kaiser was six years ago the

95
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,110
day before I was expelled from China

96
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:48,500
that's another story you can google that

97
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,319
Kizer is co-founder and host of Sinica

98
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,020
podcast which i highly recommend it

99
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,030
looks at current affairs in China hi

100
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,508
there was a really good one a few weeks

101
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,969
ago where you talk to narrator Kalon the

102
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,740
situation in Xinjiang as you know

103
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:06,379
there's massive human rights violations

104
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,330
going on there is a fantastic podcast a

105
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,250
few years ago when he was based in

106
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,289
Beijing Kaiser was director of

107
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,289
international comms for China's top

108
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,699
search engine Baidu that's another

109
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:19,180
fascinating conversation I could have

110
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:23,090
with you another panel all together and

111
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:25,669
he had lived in China for 20 years final

112
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,549
fun fact is he was involved in a heavy

113
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,240
metal band in the late 80s and 90s in

114
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,810
China so I'm sure there's something on

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,440
YouTube maybe all right and with that

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,210
introduction we will go in this order in

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,669
terms of everyone sort of talking about

118
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,500
what they want to say about the social

119
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,990
credit system so over to you Kaiser

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,639
thanks Melissa I actually don't want to

121
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,319
talk specifically about the social

122
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,949
credit system but maybe give a little

123
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,719
bit of context for why we talk about the

124
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,539
social credit system in the West the way

125
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:00,740
that we do I think that it's important

126
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:02,628
for us to think about this and I hope

127
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,089
everyone will affect all this just three

128
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:07,960
or four years ago maybe as much as five

129
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,370
years ago we had two very very different

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,440
narratives about the relationship

131
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,629
between authoritarian politics on the

132
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,089
one hand and technology on the other

133
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,839
hand one of those narratives said that

134
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:22,699
in an authoritarian political setting

135
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,560
innovation wasn't really possible we

136
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,120
forget the examples of the v2 rocket

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,120
which was developed here of course or

138
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:33,909
axiomatic belief on the part of many

139
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:36,500
Westerners that political freedom and

140
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,400
technological innovation had to coexist

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,860
they had to be hand-in-hand

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,989
the other one that we believed and now

143
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,879
of course we've changed on a time I mean

144
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,560
just in the last couple of years we've

145
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,659
suddenly gone to this belief that china

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,029
is out innovating everyone else and that

147
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:52,490
china is going to as we say in english

148
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,139
eat our lunch which is very curious

149
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,630
things I think that we were as wrong

150
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,810
than when we were dismissive of China's

151
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,850
ability in today

152
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,880
as we are now when we overestimate

153
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,139
China's ability the other narrative that

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,909
has really flipped and I think that's

155
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,610
really germane to this particular topic

156
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,910
is that we used to believe that

157
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,750
technology would ultimately undermine

158
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,139
authoritarian governments all over the

159
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,970
world we used to believe that you

160
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:22,139
couldn't nail the jello to the wall that

161
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:24,960
ultimately we were going to see no

162
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,540
internet LED revolutions all over the

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,880
world where the oppressed would rise up

164
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,740
and we have been disillusioned from that

165
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,560
we've had a series of events especially

166
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,270
in my native the United States we saw we

167
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,700
were still looking at the smoldering

168
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,700
remains of the Arab Spring where we had

169
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,229
handily appended the name of some social

170
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,300
media property to each of these Arab

171
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,909
Spring uprisings that didn't work out

172
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,190
like we thought we had the experience of

173
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,190
the Snowden revelations including the

174
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,560
revelation that the NSA was spying on

175
00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:00,200
the German government here then we had

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,550
of course the whole fiasco of the 2016

177
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,440
elections and we you know with with

178
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,150
Cambridge analytical and Facebook and

179
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,729
Russians interference in American

180
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,609
elections now we believe somehow that

181
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,680
technology is the handmaiden the very

182
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,410
trusty handmaiden of authoritarian

183
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,640
governments that China especially is

184
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,610
developing these authoritarian

185
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,780
technologies at NU we knew I think that

186
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,840
we should be careful though when we look

187
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,770
at this not to indulge in a kind of well

188
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,109
we may be a technological Orientalism we

189
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,079
should be very very careful about about

190
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,700
this and I think that the the panelists

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,729
who actually know quite a bit about

192
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,020
what's happening can attest to this

193
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:45,030
that's all I wanted to say and I'd be

194
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,770
happy to specially thanks and thank you

195
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,360
for the good introduction I'm glad to

196
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,770
hear so many people use my site and

197
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,500
hopefully in the future they'll actually

198
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,870
subscribe and let me know something of

199
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,060
that but I don't have a whole lot of

200
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,950
time so rather than first extreme what

201
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,380
social credit is I want to go to this

202
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,930
debunking theory and talk about what it

203
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,180
isn't and three things that it isn't

204
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,699
first it is not a rating system for

205
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,829
citizens in the main document leading to

206
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,870
the

207
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,830
plan for this there is no mention of

208
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,180
scores points or rankings of any kind

209
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,250
second it is not the full extent of

210
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,229
China's surveillance technological or

211
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,140
otherwise I'm primarily a Criminal

212
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,120
Procedure person the state is very able

213
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,100
to gain personal information about you

214
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,410
when it so chooses and Social Credit

215
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,960
should not be used as a synonym for all

216
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,000
invasive procedures that the Chinese

217
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,800
government does the third thing about

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,090
Social Credit that is not is it it's not

219
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,290
so tech intensive it feels like this is

220
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,670
something that the West has got onto but

221
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,349
in truth the actual systems are about

222
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,800
sharing existing government information

223
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,410
there are no algorithms involved it is

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,329
mainly a addition and subtraction so

225
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,579
what is social credit well I break it

226
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,590
down into three major Kippur shion's the

227
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,840
first is a financial portion that is

228
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,250
about financial credit reporting similar

229
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,680
to what you find in other countries

230
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:06,310
including trying to reach the great

231
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,170
unbanked or underbanked populations by

232
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,359
using some new data instead of just

233
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,280
previous lending history the second and

234
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,800
most developed portion is a system of

235
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,630
black lists and regulatory law this is

236
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,650
the part that actually has teeth now and

237
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,200
is the part that's supposed to be

238
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,890
completed by 2020 and is largely already

239
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,500
completed now there's 43 or 44 industry

240
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,420
specific black lists each regulatory

241
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,490
agency makes them and what's innovative

242
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,430
about social credit is that other

243
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,220
agencies will sometimes agree to enforce

244
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,189
things against the people blacklisted by

245
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,250
one agency and finally is a propaganda

246
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,590
publicity section which involves

247
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,600
primarily outreach to convince people of

248
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,390
the importance of being honest which in

249
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,430
China is a big issue right now and that

250
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,860
is where some of the few point systems

251
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,050
that do exist regionally come in but I

252
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,300
call them hub of publicity or propaganda

253
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,189
comfortably because say for example in

254
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,800
Shanghai one of the four locations that

255
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,750
has a full set of regulations on social

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
credit their regulations don't mention

257
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,490
the point system that they do have there

258
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,050
there are never punishments imposed for

259
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,870
something that isn't violating the law

260
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,040
or breaking a legal obligation the point

261
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,290
systems are largely educational so why

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,160
is there all this misinformation out

263
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,750
there and this

264
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,980
I actually liked the black mirror

265
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,399
metaphor because I think that there's

266
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,379
two distortion mirrors involved in the

267
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,759
way we look at this one is sort of what

268
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,220
Kaiser was getting into that we're

269
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,889
projecting our own concerns about new

270
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,839
technology on to China we're using it

271
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:40,790
instead of as a foreign power we're

272
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,370
using it as a blank slate in which we

273
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,800
can put our own anxieties in some ways I

274
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,750
compared it to environmentalism where we

275
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,878
all know about climate change and the

276
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,560
dangers it presents and sometimes rather

277
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,420
than make a plan for dealing with it

278
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,329
ourselves it's easier to say well at

279
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,709
least we're not China look at that-air

280
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,329
and we're doing the same with tech we

281
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,979
haven't even invented a system where

282
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:02,508
we're used to people being able to drive

283
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,490
with cell phones in their hand

284
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,800
we don't have legislation let alone for

285
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,779
CRISPR babies or for all of the

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,040
profiling technology and it's just

287
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,629
easier to say well at least we're not

288
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,199
China look they've got some scoring

289
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:17,420
system but the second one is

290
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,660
contrariwise is that things that go into

291
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,459
China do come out distorted sometimes

292
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,750
look at what Marxism has happened you

293
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,670
know what's happened to Marxism and that

294
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,350
comes into trying to get a new form one

295
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,180
with Chinese characteristics as the

296
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,550
Chinese government loves to say look at

297
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,620
what's happened to the war on terror

298
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,660
you know things do come back at us out

299
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,339
of China in a new form and so we do have

300
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,110
to be looking but it's a different thing

301
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,670
understanding what the real threats are

302
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,170
understanding what the real threats of

303
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,689
technology are understanding what the

304
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,610
real threats of China are are are all

305
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:49,670
important and the final thought I know

306
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,079
because my time I'm so good all right my

307
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,139
final thing is that I want to say that I

308
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,300
think the distortion on social credit

309
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,670
particularly is largely a feature not a

310
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,219
bug I think the Chinese government likes

311
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,959
this they push back hard on things like

312
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,579
Xin Jiang where we're getting at

313
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,380
something that is a third rail topic

314
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,638
they don't want us talking about social

315
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,500
credit there hasn't been a lot of

316
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,930
correction and I think there's two

317
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,059
audiences for this bad narratives on

318
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,160
social credit the first is domestic

319
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,990
where I think they liked the people in

320
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,600
China believing they're always being

321
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,579
watched it's just like the universal

322
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,800
ubiquitous surveillance cameras that are

323
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,258
in Beijing and China most of them aren't

324
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,969
even operational but in feeling like

325
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,370
you're watched makes you behave

326
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,710
differently but I also think that

327
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,900
there's an international

328
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,150
and it's not probably the one in this

329
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,970
room that's concerned about human rights

330
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,069
violations and privacy it's the one of

331
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,320
China going abroad and marketing itself

332
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,570
especially to developing nations and I

333
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,170
think it adds great legitimacy to their

334
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,520
regime to their China model when papers

335
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,800
like the New York Times and The Wall

336
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,590
Street Journal right thing saying Social

337
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,680
Credit is capable of monitoring and

338
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,870
predicting behavior across a population

339
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,790
the size of China's and when you look at

340
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,860
Ecuador when you look at Zimbabwe people

341
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,510
that are buying tech from China I think

342
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,700
that it's a great sales pitch when we

343
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:15,150
cover it wrong Thanks the things that

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,620
reminds me of Bentham and the panopticon

345
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,160
Jeremy Bentham's panopticon go ahead

346
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,200
okay so my research actually looks at

347
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,569
what do Chinese people think about it

348
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,940
and how do they respond and to answer

349
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,250
that question I did dozens of interviews

350
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,820
and as well an online survey was more

351
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:36,640
than 2,200 Chinese citizens so what did

352
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,690
we find the first is that the majority

353
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,120
at the moment

354
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,900
80% used more the commercial social

355
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,550
credit systems so systems like Sesame

356
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,060
Jim accredit or Tencent

357
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,650
which are by like private companies only

358
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,989
seven percent of the respondents

359
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,120
actually said they were aware of being

360
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,540
enrolled by a government social credit

361
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,310
system what else what it surprised us

362
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,280
the most is that actually the majority

363
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,339
eighty percent somewhat or strongly

364
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,959
approve of being part of a social credit

365
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,050
system being at commercial or government

366
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,750
and actually the majority have stronger

367
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,050
support for the government social credit

368
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,910
systems and that is because 77 percent

369
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,459
believed that the central government is

370
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,680
much better in handling personal data

371
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,630
that's interesting right if what we know

372
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,160
about the Chinese state that there's so

373
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,570
much trust that the central government

374
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,280
is good at managing this and on the

375
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,770
other hand commercial companies seen as

376
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,050
very profit hungry and being not very

377
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,750
transparent about how the scores are

378
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,420
calculated so there's much less approval

379
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,230
in the public for those type of systems

380
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,900
what else will

381
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,000
actually who has a strongest support for

382
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,939
who approves the most and interestingly

383
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,040
it's a rich the welfare citizens in

384
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,110
urban areas and that is surprising

385
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,660
because other research by pan and soon

386
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,750
find that the wealthy and rich are more

387
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:05,390
Pro liberal more Pro market reform so

388
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,270
why is this type of citizen more in

389
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,890
favor of being surveilled or being in

390
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,620
favor of the systems that could

391
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,870
potentially put impose constraints to

392
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,780
the political economic as well as social

393
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,420
freedom and opportunities well the

394
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,760
answers we found are to the first as a

395
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,250
benefits it's actually the rich who

396
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,020
benefit most from these systems so the

397
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,750
commercial ones they're more like

398
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,630
loyalty schemes if you consume more you

399
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,880
have a higher score also the government

400
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,160
once is actually there are some pilots

401
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,750
who actually allow you to make a

402
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,790
donation in order to improve your

403
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,760
assessment like in the city of Rome term

404
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,250
so that allows also people to game the

405
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,470
system the second is when we look at

406
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,170
benefits people in urban areas have much

407
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,600
better access to the benefits let's say

408
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,819
a lot of benefits are like shared biking

409
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,300
services if you live in the city and

410
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,550
you're rich and urban you can use these

411
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,609
services a lot more than the people in

412
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,530
urban rural areas the second what we

413
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,139
found is actually the perceptions of

414
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,079
what social credit systems are is very

415
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,970
different in China and here we really

416
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,460
find that citizens perceive it not

417
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,410
as a surveillance instrument but much

418
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,840
more as an instrument to close what we

419
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:24,220
call regulation and institutional gaps

420
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,419
and what we mean here is that in China

421
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,090
there's a lot more pressure for

422
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,430
companies to be held accountable seventy

423
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,240
percent in our survey said there is an

424
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,800
issue of trust in Chinese society and

425
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,290
using these additional information

426
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,139
collected by social credit systems help

427
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:45,560
them to address issues like food safety

428
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,840
issues internet scamming or pollution so

429
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,840
it's seen as an additional instrument to

430
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,870
provide reliable information in a

431
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,889
society that has undergone very dramatic

432
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,229
changes in the last 40 years and finally

433
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,760
so credit is also seen not as a

434
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,770
surveillant instrument because people

435
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,960
honestly think if the Public Security

436
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,139
Bureau wants to get information they are

437
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,570
much better and more effective base

438
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,850
collecting this data so in summary at

439
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,669
the moment people see the Social Credit

440
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,370
systems commercial as well as government

441
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,370
ones as an instrument to close

442
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:27,020
institutional and regulate regulatory

443
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,239
gaps and it's really shows there's a lot

444
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,920
support but the support is not blind and

445
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,380
in the interviews in the survey topics

446
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,780
like fairness and transparency came up

447
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,080
and also privacy concerns similar what

448
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,870
we have in Europe or the US but last

449
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,949
word is these initiatives we see are

450
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:48,050
very early on and things might change as

451
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,870
the systems develop so the support is

452
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,950
not blind and might become more negative

453
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:57,229
as current systems develop

454
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,200
thank you Manya yeah well we'll wrap

455
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,900
this circle up and shortly highlight the

456
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,720
differences in Western countries and in

457
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,430
China when you look at media and social

458
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,090
media responses to the social credit

459
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,880
system so to go back it was 2014 when

460
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:16,730
the Chinese government announced that by

461
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,180
2020 it would implement their social

462
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,770
management program nationwide as a

463
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,650
government tool to regulate market and

464
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,629
society based on reputation information

465
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,430
and making sure that people would comply

466
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,720
with the law and here we are five years

467
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:34,550
later and there are existing programs

468
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,770
running locally we have the black liquor

469
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,740
blacklist system for those who do not

470
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,110
comply with court orders there is a

471
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,590
range of join sanction and reward

472
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,570
schemes but there is not one National

473
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,199
Social Credit system in place yet and

474
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:53,030
building efforts are still underway yet

475
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,160
in the Western media however the

476
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,580
emerging system has been called

477
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:01,100
Orwellian and creepy and dystopian with

478
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,770
some suggesting that every Chinese

479
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,360
citizen would get a score and that the

480
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,049
Chinese government would would be

481
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,668
watching their every single move

482
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,009
yeah and often comparing it to black

483
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:15,049
mirror I mean the black mare comparison

484
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:17,389
has become so common that if you look at

485
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,119
Google Trends China Social Credit and

486
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:22,158
black mare are most related topics so

487
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:25,099
it's the number two related topic to

488
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,709
China's Social Credit System and so it's

489
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,448
no wonder if we read about the system in

490
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:32,349
this way in Germany or in the

491
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:34,940
Netherlands or whatever in America that

492
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:37,129
China's Social Credit project is

493
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,589
something that sends shivers down the

494
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:41,839
back of people because they read about

495
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:44,389
it in this way and then we look at

496
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,609
Chinese media and China's propaganda

497
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:49,488
efforts and we see a completely

498
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:51,978
different picture of China's social

499
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:54,859
credit really it's like a night and day

500
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:57,769
difference since the very first years

501
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:59,779
that social credit became a key theme on

502
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:03,859
the agenda of Chinese authorities

503
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:06,619
mainland media have been promoting it as

504
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:09,829
a collective effort of the Chinese

505
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:12,738
people together to build on this culture

506
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:15,619
of trust to regulate market and society

507
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:17,179
and to resolve existing problems that

508
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:20,629
are widespread when it comes to

509
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:24,919
fraudulent Affairs and enforcing court

510
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:26,718
orders professional mail practices and

511
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,059
so on I can give you many examples and

512
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:32,389
right now you see that the social credit

513
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:34,789
a propaganda machine is running at full

514
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:37,008
speed I mean besides the state media

515
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:39,139
reports you have a website there's an

516
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,479
entire magazine dedicated to it there

517
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:43,879
dozens of social media accounts there

518
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:46,369
even is a credit China tour that travels

519
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:48,948
throughout the country and through texts

520
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:52,309
and cartoons and videos and there's even

521
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:54,469
a song now Chinese media often do not

522
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,759
touch upon what this social credit

523
00:21:54,469 --> 00:22:01,339
system exactly is but there's more a

524
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,809
clear narrative or a clear message in

525
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:05,269
their narrative that it's all about

526
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:09,168
honesty and trustworthiness as a

527
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:10,729
universal norm it is about but punishing

528
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:13,969
those who are untrustworthy and

529
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:14,499
rewarding those who are acting in good

530
00:22:13,969 --> 00:22:18,829
faith

531
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:20,569
so by emphasizing how emphasizing how

532
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,610
social credit brings harmony to the

533
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,889
people

534
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,639
in order to society and makes people's

535
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,250
lives better

536
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,080
it is perhaps unsurprising to see that

537
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,350
the implementation of the Social Credit

538
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,199
seems to be generally very well received

539
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,330
by Chinese netizens I mean if you look

540
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,670
at it in a time like you said as well of

541
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,770
food safety crisis and fraud and

542
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,680
healthcare corruption there are many who

543
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,750
now think that a trustworthy society is

544
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,460
more important than individual privacy I

545
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,270
just want to follow up and perhaps it is

546
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,440
because I am a journalist so I take some

547
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,450
offense to it when you say Western

548
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,320
media's misreporting I mean who are you

549
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,180
talking about we're talking about

550
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,250
thousands and thousands of music

551
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,530
let's name names because I think that

552
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,530
people should know which publications

553
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:10,840
are not reporting it properly and which

554
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,320
publications you think are name names

555
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,090
okay well I'm Dutch so for me it's I'm

556
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,129
from Amsterdam but I mean there's one

557
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,780
Dutch journalist program that is one of

558
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,100
the that is probably the best it's

559
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,139
called infant off I don't know if we

560
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,810
have any Dutch people here but they were

561
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,640
literally breaking the news of in China

562
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,159
there's a new program and every citizen

563
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,830
will get their own score if you buy beer

564
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,600
that score score will be lowered this is

565
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,669
something that was told by Dutch

566
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,980
politicians as well in the media

567
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,560
Jeremy how many is it I don't want an

568
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,540
economist I mean you name names the

569
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,970
economy you can't say Western media and

570
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:48,460
not name is a cop-out so like jump in

571
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,440
the Economist I'll tell The Economist

572
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,480
did it wrong - I think it was the verge

573
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,320
I don't want to name his but

574
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:00,430
there's ABC was the worst that was the

575
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,470
worst go for it you want to article even

576
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,060
the wired article although although the

577
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,710
author of the the wired article has

578
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,200
backed off quite a bit on that and she's

579
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,850
really self-corrected quite a bit in

580
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,520
Kenya you want it what the Germans of

581
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,870
course the tabloids built but there's

582
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,120
some better ones so I don't want to do

583
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:18,100
media slashing because I've also seen

584
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,979
some good reporting and decide and fats

585
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,550
which are more at like more like high

586
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,460
quality newspapers so we have to be

587
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:30,040
careful to slash all journalists so it

588
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,690
depends but we've seen a lot of bad

589
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,850
publicity in Germany

590
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,470
I want a single one out for praise I

591
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,969
think some have gone out of their way to

592
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,340
really correct and have really helped a

593
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,870
lot of reporters to report on this more

594
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,760
correctly one person especially

595
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,860
deserving of praise is James Palmer

596
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,660
who's the editor of the Asia editor of

597
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,209
foreign policy who's really gone out of

598
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,100
his way I'll disagree on a lot of other

599
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,710
things but he's pointed to Jeremy Tom's

600
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,820
work child a lot translates and really

601
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,510
helped to correct that narrative a lot

602
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,520
and he he's quite can't be quite the

603
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:04,510
fact that he actually of James Palmer a

604
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:08,980
foreign policy that he does this I want

605
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:11,500
to go to Guinea's survey because I find

606
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,420
it fascinating 80 percent of Chinese

607
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,330
internet users taking a positive view

608
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,010
can you talk a little bit about

609
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:21,610
methodology when I read this I was like

610
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:24,370
this is fascinating but you conducted

611
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,110
this survey in China I as a reporter

612
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,139
interviewed so many people in China and

613
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,360
totally get this self censorship thing

614
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,040
all the time how do you how worried

615
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,000
certain were you that the people

616
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,340
answering were answering as you know I

617
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,870
it was anonymous but give us a little

618
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,980
sense of the methodology and I

619
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:48,070
understand it was 2,200 Chinese citizens

620
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,380
there's 1.4 billion Chinese how did it

621
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:52,800
this all work okay now I can talk for

622
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,800
three hours

623
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,400
okay so this survey was we used a panel

624
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,830
survey survey method so this is we use

625
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,670
people who used more than 40,000 apps

626
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:09,070
and from that we sampled randomly by age

627
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,900
region and gender and of course the

628
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,909
people who responded I mean that was

629
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,610
anonymous but you can if you really make

630
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:19,030
an effort track IP addresses so it's not

631
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:21,189
of that anonymous but it was really made

632
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,500
through a market survey data so people

633
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,880
probably are a little bit biased it's

634
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:30,150
not the first survey they filled in and

635
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,070
in order to make sure we are really had

636
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,560
like honest answers we also did in-depth

637
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,100
interviews again like randomly sampling

638
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,139
by age groups and gender to make sure we

639
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,570
got it correct and even our in-depth

640
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,809
interviews which were really through a

641
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:47,689
private connections

642
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:50,480
well the same came out if you asked

643
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,179
really Chinese really people are saying

644
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,460
look what's all I mean of course I value

645
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,879
privacy but I also value quality of life

646
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:02,240
and these social credit systems make it

647
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:05,120
easier for me to get I don't know check

648
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,950
into a hotel so why not so I think it's

649
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,340
I think everyone would agree

650
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,950
surprisingly an open attitude towards it

651
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,959
by talking about media I mean also there

652
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,940
is see less discussion about it in the

653
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,789
media right so that's one of the reasons

654
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,889
to manya I certainly love your your

655
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,019
thoughts because you check on people's

656
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:26,570
opinions on this on social yes so I'm

657
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,399
I'm very very active on China's biggest

658
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,279
social media networks like Weibo and

659
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,739
WeChat and I trek opinions all the time

660
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,539
of what people are writing and what I

661
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,830
want to add to what you're saying is

662
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:40,820
that what you see on Chinese social

663
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,009
media often is that the big stories stay

664
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,350
really small so there's no talk about

665
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:47,779
the social credit system it's very it's

666
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,149
not a popular topic at all but the small

667
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,220
stories get really big and just to give

668
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:53,840
one example for example last year that

669
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,970
was this guy who was misbehaving on a

670
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,070
train and he refused to get up of his

671
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,080
chair and he pretend to pretend it to be

672
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,850
in a wheelchair and he wasn't and this

673
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,619
was all recorded on video and he became

674
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,330
a huge trending topic about people

675
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,980
misbehaving on trains and how dare day

676
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,379
because these tickets can be really

677
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,200
expensive and he was put on a blacklist

678
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:14,570
so he couldn't travel by train for 180

679
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,220
days afterwards and this is when you see

680
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,220
a lot of people showing their support

681
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,019
they pay a lot of money to for that seat

682
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,119
and if somebody is taking their seat

683
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:25,309
then it's affecting them personally and

684
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:26,869
so they say come on those black lists we

685
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,399
should have them on buses we should have

686
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,289
them on airplanes we should have the

687
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,998
menu everywhere and this is where you

688
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,129
see that there's a lot of support for

689
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:36,080
this kind of system but not for the

690
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:38,168
great picture overall but for the

691
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,869
smaller parts of the system

692
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:44,179
Jeremy going back to the survey and

693
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:45,769
we've spoken about this before I think

694
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:47,929
it's important for people who aren't

695
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:50,600
working on social credit to understand

696
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:53,480
my experience which is that if you ask

697
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,590
the average Chinese person what do you

698
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,240
think of social credit

699
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,879
Social Credit system they would have no

700
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,950
idea what you're talking about the vast

701
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,799
majority of reporting on Social Credit

702
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:07,289
is in the West I've attended Chinese

703
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,260
legal conferences where we're talking

704
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:12,299
about Social Credit and we spend 50% of

705
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,129
the time saying well it seems like the

706
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,490
West thinks this is really important so

707
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,650
we thought we ought to have a conference

708
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,179
also the phrase Social Credit at the

709
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,429
Chinese for Hoshino

710
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,570
if you didn't know there was a system

711
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,929
with this name

712
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:30,418
it could mean public trust and if you

713
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:32,070
ask people to what extent do you approve

714
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,750
which is I believe the one question that

715
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,450
was asked to find out people's approval

716
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,370
of Social Credit in this survey if you

717
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,980
ask to what extent do you approve of the

718
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,250
public trust system what fool would say

719
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,990
oh no I'm totally empty public trust

720
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,659
that other data in your survey did do a

721
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,309
good job of showing that it was people

722
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:53,520
were confused about what Social Credit

723
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:56,850
was it covered everything from these

724
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,129
private reward systems through the court

725
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,260
blacklist for people who fail to act on

726
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,779
of court judgment so we don't know what

727
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,549
it is people are agreeing to I compare

728
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,080
it to the drug enforcement system in the

729
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,990
US via asta people how what do you think

730
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,720
of drug regulation in the US and a lot

731
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,460
of people thought I was talking about

732
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,230
the war on drugs but other people

733
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,390
thought I was talking about medical

734
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,620
patents and the FDA and some people

735
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,330
thought I was talking about their local

736
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,639
pharmacists policy of getting

737
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,010
prescriptions back and then said 80% of

738
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,240
people who prove you we need to get more

739
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:29,970
specific and I think that's probably

740
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:35,070
your next project is finding out what

741
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:37,140
people think that we're answering to I

742
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:41,639
do want I wonder the other thing about

743
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:43,020
your survey and polling is a few years

744
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,210
ago and I'd be interested in what Kaiser

745
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,129
has to say about this a few years ago if

746
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,140
you asked Americans what they thought of

747
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,809
Facebook and Facebook taking all your

748
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,649
data they wouldn't have the response

749
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:58,020
they have today five years ago six years

750
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,939
ago it would have been you know fresh

751
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,879
off the Arab Spring Oh social media is

752
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,070
great for democracy and I have nothing

753
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,780
to hide there's no skeletons in my

754
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,240
closet I don't mind if they take some

755
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,250
data from me so

756
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,230
when you ask a question I wonder to what

757
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,210
extent it's almost too early to ask

758
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,920
people what they think about something

759
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,450
like this because they themselves

760
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,670
haven't thought about it and don't even

761
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,320
know the ramifications of that so you

762
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:25,910
know the 80% figure can be read

763
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,100
incorrectly as Chinese people approving

764
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:31,610
of it when in reality they haven't

765
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,290
really thought about it I mean I think

766
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,820
we asked a couple of questions right so

767
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:37,879
the first question we also asked should

768
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,530
it be implemented and only 1% actually

769
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,640
answered thinking it should not be

770
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:45,710
implemented we asked is that who should

771
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,420
handle your data most responsibly and

772
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,030
they say the central government so there

773
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,130
a lot of indication that actually a lot

774
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,678
of Chinese people don't have a problem

775
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,620
with providing some personal data we

776
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:00,110
asked about trade-offs if you could pick

777
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:03,110
quality of life or privacy a lot of

778
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:05,209
people actually had to pick a quality of

779
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,840
life so I think there's really a

780
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:11,330
preference for using like online systems

781
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,220
for improving their life and there's not

782
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,290
so much awareness about privacy issues

783
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,150
it doesn't mean it changes right I mean

784
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,460
as I mentioned in the Chinese media and

785
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,559
the author's managers mentioned there is

786
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,080
less debate in the state media on

787
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:26,240
privacy issues if that changes the

788
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,399
opinion might change also in the survey

789
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,679
a lot of people raised that fairness and

790
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,510
transparency is important to them at the

791
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,730
moment there's very little transparency

792
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,290
of how for example Jim accredit

793
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,480
calculates their scores so the

794
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,678
commercial providers and people don't

795
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,410
find it they're not very comfortable

796
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,720
that they don't know how their scores

797
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,690
calculated that similar we have issues

798
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,550
in the West so for example 16 percent of

799
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,220
all the users of the commercial users

800
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,409
using Jim accredit said 16 percent said

801
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:57,440
they have unfriended a friend on social

802
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,050
media just because in order to influence

803
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,570
or to avoid a negative score on GEMA

804
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,460
credit so 16 percent already unfriended

805
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,090
a friend so people are changing their

806
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,210
behavior and they are aware they also 16

807
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:13,459
percent said they have posted different

808
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,860
online posts because they want to avoid

809
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,270
negative scores on Jim on credit so this

810
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,219
is now talking about the commercial

811
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,820
providers so people are changing the

812
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,710
behavior so it's not I think

813
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,840
not too early there's already people

814
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:27,179
changing their behavior they're aware of

815
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,439
certain trade-offs but they make choices

816
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:35,159
maybe differently than maybe we do I

817
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,840
want Kaiser yeah just to back up again

818
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,940
you know there's always these questions

819
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,439
about terms and definitions just like

820
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,639
I'm saying with Social Credit for me

821
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,889
there's actually three different wings

822
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:46,258
just to make it clear that the German

823
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:48,928
our sesame credit system it's a reward

824
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,450
loyalty program run by ant Financial

825
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:53,190
which is under Alibaba the prizes for

826
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,299
getting a perfect score on it are things

827
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,389
like you don't have to put a deposit

828
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:59,129
down at hotels there's a lot of talk

829
00:33:57,389 --> 00:34:00,928
about it on the web but it's largely

830
00:33:59,129 --> 00:34:03,539
don't bother getting your score up high

831
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:05,340
because nothing good happens it used to

832
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:08,190
want to be a credit reporting company

833
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,190
and has since given up that ambition

834
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,079
after the People's Bank of China nixed

835
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,020
their initial application to sort of go

836
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,000
there I talking about privacy in China I

837
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,179
think we hit on a really important topic

838
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,489
it's funny we used to talk globally

839
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,710
about exchanging your privacy for

840
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,118
security and then we started talking

841
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,579
about exchanging your privacy for

842
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,260
convenience and it seems to me that the

843
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,649
value of privacy is getting cheaper and

844
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,030
cheaper and we're all you know the EU is

845
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:39,239
doing a little better about trying to

846
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,919
deal with this issue but all that it's

847
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,408
meant so far for me is clicking it's

848
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,609
okay to keep cookies more often on

849
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:46,500
websites rather than me actually

850
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,000
voluntarily consenting to give out

851
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,429
information we haven't really addressed

852
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,520
it Chinese people are concerned about

853
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,139
privacy one of one of the private

854
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,879
companies that was collecting data was

855
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,250
actually fined for having people

856
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,680
automatically opt in instead of have to

857
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:05,240
voluntarily actively opt in to one of

858
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,040
these private credit reporting schemes

859
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,689
but beyond that the new civil code is

860
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,750
being passed they just released for

861
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,460
public comment the section on privacy

862
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,010
which is open for comment and anyone can

863
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,480
go look at it we did translate it but it

864
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,890
is about addressing the rights the

865
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,210
important thing to understand is that

866
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,810
you know I talked about different

867
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:27,450
meanings of terms what the EU means by

868
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,460
privacy and dignity and personality

869
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,529
rights versus what the US law means by

870
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,839
privacy versus what China means by

871
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,510
privacy are all different beasts what

872
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,850
China mean

873
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,470
by privacy is generally privacy between

874
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,900
citizens and between citizens and

875
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,430
corporations they don't mean it between

876
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,830
the government because the government

877
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,720
has the ability to get your data there

878
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:48,490
are such a thing as search warrants it

879
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,080
once the police decide to open a case on

880
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,000
you the search warrants are issued by

881
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,910
police to police

882
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,620
there aren't external checks so it's

883
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,540
always assumed that the police will just

884
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:00,640
be confidential with your information

885
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,600
there isn't really meaningful privacy

886
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,160
from the government except for the

887
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,470
government's own promises to stay away

888
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,020
from information but citizens are very

889
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:09,910
concerned about privacy versus each

890
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:12,460
other and in fact in some ways the law

891
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:15,640
is actually stronger than the US is for

892
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:19,270
citizens versus private entities you

893
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,670
know I think there were some very

894
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:24,100
pernicious ideas out there and I think

895
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,440
frankly orientalist ideas that suggest

896
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,000
that Chinese are unconcerned with this

897
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,860
idea of privacy I would say that they

898
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,870
are no less concerned with it though

899
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,330
they exhibit the exact same patterns of

900
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:37,750
behavior as say Americans do which is to

901
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:40,720
say they hear about eight data leak they

902
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,640
fly into a high dudgeon for exactly 24

903
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,140
hours and then go back to scrolling

904
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,850
through as quickly as they possibly can

905
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,089
to find the little box they can take to

906
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:52,569
say yes have my private data that I

907
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:54,880
think that Europeans are the outlier in

908
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,770
this the only ones that seem at least

909
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,140
ostensibly to be more concerned although

910
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,730
GDP are seems to have done not much more

911
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,910
than you've suggested make me actually

912
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:06,130
have to assent to cookies where before

913
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:08,290
it was but you know the idea that

914
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,700
Chinese are happy to have technology

915
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,480
companies ride roughshod over their

916
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:18,009
privacy is is preposterous there is

917
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:22,450
actually a new I think it's called the

918
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:24,460
personal information was it called does

919
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,370
a standard the personal information

920
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:31,960
security standard and you can work out

921
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:34,089
the acronym yourself but it's it's

922
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,010
actually modeled very closely and in

923
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,260
some places more stringent than gdpr

924
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:41,210
so I think we should be very careful

925
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,680
about this idea that

926
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,900
something that we talked about before we

927
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,299
got onstage though I could you talk a

928
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,360
little bit more about why then the

929
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:53,880
there's a even though Chinese do care

930
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,450
about privacy that the the public

931
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,660
conversation is more benign the black

932
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,859
mirror versus the Star Trek yes that's a

933
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,290
very good point I mean after I had more

934
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,690
than three minutes initially yeah I

935
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,880
think that in in all countries

936
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:11,580
technology is created and consumed in a

937
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,740
kind of social social and cultural

938
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,200
matrix and it's different from country

939
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,640
to country you have to think about the

940
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,759
Chinese and their experience with

941
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:23,549
technology in the last 40 years since

942
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,530
the advent to perform an opening anyone

943
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:27,990
alive today who has sort of experienced

944
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,600
this they've only known technology to

945
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:32,459
improve in lockstep in perfect lockstep

946
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,009
with the improvement of your life your

947
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,240
welfare your love it the availability of

948
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,500
consumables it's it's so tightly

949
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,100
intertwined that there's very little

950
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:46,170
reason to be suspicious of technology

951
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,089
couple that with the very technocratic

952
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,720
underpinnings of the Chinese polity

953
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,300
itself

954
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,730
couple that with I mean really China is

955
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,310
the land of nerd empowerment if you are

956
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,100
a technologist or a scientist there you

957
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:01,410
know it's it's a higher social status at

958
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,110
us than anywhere else in China unlike in

959
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,060
the United States the bully football

960
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,160
player doesn't roll by you in his Camaro

961
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,799
roll down the window and shout nerd at

962
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,899
you instead you know the nerd gets the

963
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,930
girl it's always like that in in China

964
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,150
and it's a very different so they're

965
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,950
less suspicious of it you don't end up

966
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,090
having conversations as some knowledge

967
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,890
who are parents here

968
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,360
well I'm constantly in the u.s. having

969
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,370
conversations about limiting my

970
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,630
children's screen time I try to have

971
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,430
those conversations with my Chinese

972
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,190
friends and they won't have them because

973
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,799
they're too busy on their phones so it's

974
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:37,680
a very different world look we talked

975
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,170
about if the u.s. we look at the science

976
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,839
fiction that we produce in the US or in

977
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,270
Europe when was the last movie that you

978
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,890
saw that wasn't fundamentally dystopian

979
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,770
I can think of a rival and that's about

980
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:51,900
the only one but that isn't you know

981
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,759
instead it's mostly sort of Blade Runner

982
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,460
and that has been for a long time

983
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,950
real suspicion of Technology and that's

984
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,750
you know in many ways very healthy China

985
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,220
is not in its black mirror face that

986
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,500
China is still very much in its Star

987
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,790
Trek face where it's the last place on

988
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,160
earth holes where there is this

989
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:10,560
widespread embrace of a techno

990
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,930
optimistic point of view to what extent

991
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,730
is in its Star Trek face because the

992
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,160
government hasn't allowed a discussion

993
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,990
to get to the black mirror face in other

994
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,730
words well I'll just leave it at that

995
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,830
for you and then I know Kenya wants to

996
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,910
yeah you know that's a tough question

997
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,880
because you know it's hard to sort of

998
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:30,660
prove negative you don't know but I do

999
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,369
not think that there are limits to

1000
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,830
conversations that are critical about

1001
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:37,410
things like privacy violations about

1002
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,029
over dependency on technology about the

1003
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,960
sort of the D human that the people have

1004
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,880
these conversations

1005
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,830
there actually are conversations

1006
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,900
happening about the potential downsides

1007
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,020
of artificial intelligence they are not

1008
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,880
common they're not coming from our

1009
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,560
leading technologists inside it's not

1010
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,480
the way that Elon Musk or Bill Gates

1011
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,570
talked about summoning the demon of AI

1012
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,520
it's not our top you know like the late

1013
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,820
Stephen Hawking our top research

1014
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,109
scientists talking about the demon of AI

1015
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,420
instead you know these are mostly maybe

1016
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:08,009
happening among in in philosophy

1017
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,200
departments at the Chinese Academy of

1018
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:12,150
Social Sciences but it's it's still it's

1019
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,609
it is happening there is a discussion

1020
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,130
about AI and ethics but it's not as

1021
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:18,990
mainstreamed as it is in the West I mean

1022
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,460
I just want to say why there's not a

1023
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,919
discussion because we're talking about

1024
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,500
early stages so when we look at the

1025
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,230
government run low poll social pilot

1026
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,050
systems there are 43 cities around China

1027
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:33,960
who have some form of local pilot but in

1028
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:36,840
our survey only 7% we're aware even

1029
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,240
though 43% lived in a city which were

1030
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,340
officially part of a local pilot and why

1031
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,649
is that why are people not aware it's

1032
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,780
simply because most of the pilots and we

1033
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,570
mentioned before don't target initially

1034
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,270
citizens say as a assessment system

1035
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:53,040
focused on businesses and so that's

1036
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,630
maybe also why citizens don't discuss it

1037
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,430
it doesn't affect their daily life

1038
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,970
people don't even know what that it

1039
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:01,410
exists so but it might change so I mean

1040
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,990
that's why it's good to have this debate

1041
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:04,460
if the

1042
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,830
systems development the plan is that

1043
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,900
initially lots of local pilots start

1044
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:11,210
with businesses but the plan is it gets

1045
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,950
extended to the individuals and if that

1046
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:15,140
is the case and of course it will affect

1047
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,759
them and then citizens already in

1048
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,410
interviews mentioned that they are

1049
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,450
concerned about fairness and often they

1050
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,460
mentioned oh they are worried then that

1051
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,319
the local government officials who have

1052
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,869
the right networks can you know get away

1053
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,330
with it but the average citizens are

1054
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:30,890
bind by their assessment so it will

1055
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,480
continue that discussion would be

1056
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,819
continued about fairness transparency

1057
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,670
and actually in Germany we have exactly

1058
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:41,680
the same debates so it's really worse -

1059
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:47,420
and globally discuss these topics but

1060
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:49,220
Jeremy you have a thought Jeremy as

1061
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,840
you're responding I want the audience to

1062
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,939
start thinking of questions I want to

1063
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,260
start question and answer after this so

1064
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,940
start to give your questions and there's

1065
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,650
a mic in the middle you can get in line

1066
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,340
and and get going on that

1067
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:04,250
go ahead Jeremy yeah I mean I disagree a

1068
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,890
little I I think that the reason most

1069
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,050
people are unaware of the point systems

1070
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,759
that are piloted in a few areas and Rong

1071
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,040
Chun is the one that gets written about

1072
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,020
the most is because they don't impact

1073
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,640
people's lives that they're part of that

1074
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,710
educational component

1075
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,410
they have rewards and they even have

1076
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,540
some punishments but the punishments are

1077
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,990
for things where you've already been

1078
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,150
punished for breaking a law so what

1079
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,649
you're really getting is a supplementary

1080
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,570
punishment more along the lines of the

1081
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,850
consequences of having a criminal record

1082
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,910
in the u.s. say so if you get caught

1083
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:39,290
stealing a TV and the police come out

1084
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,350
while you're walking out with that TV

1085
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:45,020
your thought is not oh damn my social

1086
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,930
credit is gone your thought is oh I'm

1087
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,910
going to jail and yes having been to

1088
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,830
jail will lower your social credit score

1089
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,480
but it's not that you have a low score

1090
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,430
that results in punishments it's that

1091
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,410
you got punished that results in a low

1092
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,330
score and and I should say just to back

1093
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,180
up that these are educational systems

1094
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:05,420
the big reward for the highest level of

1095
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:09,259
score in Rong Chun is a 200 run menB

1096
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:12,080
that's $30 a u.s. transportation subsidy

1097
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,560
for riding the buses that's about a meal

1098
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,110
even in Rong Chun for three people

1099
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,610
so these are not huge benefits that

1100
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,560
people would be changing the behavior I

1101
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:22,210
think there will be more scoring systems

1102
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,630
and I think they will largely be ignore

1103
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:27,130
below that is not the real heart of

1104
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,460
Social Credit which is this regulatory

1105
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:33,700
system I see one person at the mic so

1106
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:36,070
I'm gonna just throw in one question

1107
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,149
can you hear me yes yes um do you mind

1108
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,310
holding I'm gonna throw in one more

1109
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,400
question because I just see you next so

1110
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:45,520
we'll go to you right after but people

1111
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,190
are shy can we talk a little bit whoever

1112
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,710
wants to jump in about the government

1113
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:53,710
different governments municipalities and

1114
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:55,210
also companies will decide their mini

1115
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,900
version of Social Credit right whether

1116
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:00,580
it's the banking or whatever um not much

1117
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,510
discussion going on in China then about

1118
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:06,340
biases and you know sort of here's

1119
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,570
here's example I can't help and not talk

1120
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,950
about she and Jung when I'm talking

1121
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,770
about China these days all right it's

1122
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:14,080
just it's just almost sort of necessary

1123
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:16,540
I can it Ramadan has just started and

1124
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:21,100
and in Xinjiang the Muslim minority

1125
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,990
there from reports that we're hearing

1126
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,360
and this happens every year it seems

1127
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,669
like but is that they are discouraged

1128
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,430
from fasting and so I can see a

1129
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,950
situation where the local government and

1130
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,600
Jiang Jiang and a city would say well

1131
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,750
whatever the Social Credit or whatever

1132
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,240
they decide to call it will will will

1133
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,220
sort of penalize somebody if they decide

1134
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,370
to fast right like there are potential

1135
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,480
problems with with implementing and

1136
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,370
rolling this out where there are

1137
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,020
assumptions about what is good behavior

1138
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,580
versus what is bad and I just don't know

1139
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:54,640
if any of you guys have thoughts like

1140
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,700
that I bring this up because in some

1141
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,490
ways our talk is about debunking and so

1142
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,919
we're all aligned here one thing is if I

1143
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,259
had I I'm moderator but I've had my

1144
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,640
choice I feel like we're missing one

1145
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,890
additional panelist which is we are

1146
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,600
missing somebody from the human rights

1147
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:12,730
community who follows this and I think

1148
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,279
we should all be mindful of that because

1149
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:17,590
there are people who do feel that what's

1150
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,280
happening in China is a black mirror at

1151
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,440
the

1152
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,300
and we're here - bunking it so I just

1153
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,920
wanted to bring it up my role is as a

1154
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,260
moderator and but there's really no

1155
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,609
human rights panelist to ask that

1156
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,290
question so I just wanted to throw that

1157
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:34,410
in there Jeremy - yeah I think you know

1158
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,880
more about maybe the Shin Jung issue but

1159
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,520
just to respond directly to young I

1160
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,650
think this is an idea of well should we

1161
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,359
have a human rights panelist here -

1162
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:45,670
because this is actually about law I

1163
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,310
think well Jeremy is all about law and

1164
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,720
actually what Jeremy just said if you're

1165
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,339
looking at following the law and then

1166
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,910
Social Credit is following I don't

1167
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:57,310
really see why we need a human rights

1168
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,290
panelist here because then then we are

1169
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,820
conflating maybe various issues again

1170
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,970
and this is the big problem I think

1171
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:06,400
about the social credit system in media

1172
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,839
in general I mean the Chinese media do

1173
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,420
it too and outside of China it's

1174
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:13,420
happening all kinds of different issues

1175
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,190
are being conflated with in this Social

1176
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,240
Credit issue and I was thinking about it

1177
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,950
the other day it's almost like a

1178
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,839
MacGuffin do you know in Hitchcock

1179
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,089
movies the entire movie revolves around

1180
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,980
a suitcase and nobody really knows

1181
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,900
what's inside the suitcase but still all

1182
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,630
the actors are motivated by it and are

1183
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,980
their behavior is driven by it and this

1184
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,890
is sometimes what the social credit

1185
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,660
system is I mean Chinese propaganda are

1186
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,578
filling in things about the social

1187
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,069
credit system so are a lot of Western

1188
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:42,310
media and institutions without us

1189
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:44,650
actually knowing what it is we're

1190
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,470
talking about and we are talking about a

1191
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:50,560
legacy legislative body in in many ways

1192
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:51,848
so I'll pass it on to Jeremy Jeremy and

1193
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,000
then we will get to you you've been very

1194
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:58,480
patient yeah it's it's to me an

1195
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,010
optimistic thought that the Chinese

1196
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,960
government would deal with the xin zhang

1197
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:05,349
issue with something as subtle a social

1198
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,990
credit what they'll do for somebody who

1199
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:11,109
is not fast or as fasting during Ramadan

1200
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:13,209
is put them in a center one of the

1201
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:15,790
reasons I remain interested in talking

1202
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,500
about social credit as opposed to my

1203
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:21,069
normal field which is Criminal Procedure

1204
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:24,130
is because I feel like the bad reporting

1205
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:27,430
on social credit has distracted people

1206
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:29,500
from actual problems in China of which

1207
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,089
there are many I think it has also

1208
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,810
distract us from actual problems outside

1209
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:33,190
of China

1210
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,470
which are related to the tech that we're

1211
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,880
projecting on China but I think that I

1212
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,089
can say my for myself personally

1213
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,100
watching things be reported about social

1214
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,590
credit that I knew simply weren't true

1215
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,390
made me doubt what was happening in she

1216
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,350
and John for quite a long time until I

1217
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,900
could confirm it

1218
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,029
through my own research and I think that

1219
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,710
that is a real issue and that's one of

1220
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,890
the reasons that I keep talking about it

1221
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,420
okay we're gonna go to questions if

1222
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,359
that's all right thank you very much for

1223
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,430
your patience go well my question is

1224
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,450
quite simple do you think this kind of

1225
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:10,529
system could be implemented into Western

1226
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:14,049
societies or is it really specific to

1227
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:16,180
China and the citizenship in China and

1228
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:20,310
do you know if there is in the

1229
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:23,020
initiative already in Western societies

1230
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:25,029
similar to this kind of system thank you

1231
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,370
I think that one's for you if I know

1232
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:30,280
anything but I could I love to answer

1233
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:32,710
that question I think that in terms of

1234
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,420
the sort of system we're often talking

1235
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,120
about when we talk about Social Credit

1236
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,820
in China it already exists in Western

1237
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,730
nations it just exists not through a

1238
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:45,670
concerted government effort but through

1239
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:48,940
private corporations slowly beginning to

1240
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:51,940
use data guided solely by profit and

1241
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,800
limited only by law in the in in

1242
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,290
addition to private companies using your

1243
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,480
data to do things such as manage welfare

1244
00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:01,240
benefits in the US which their

1245
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,600
algorithms carry inherent biases of race

1246
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,950
and past interactions with the law into

1247
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,630
the decision-making for who receives

1248
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,339
benefits but that we also have

1249
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,430
predictive policing models being

1250
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:15,820
explored in the US where based on your

1251
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:18,970
likelihood to either be a victim or

1252
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:20,890
perpetrator of violent crime the police

1253
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,930
could based on a score that's supposed

1254
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:24,609
to measure that come to your door and

1255
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,910
talk to you about the risks of gang

1256
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:30,190
activity that to me is at least as

1257
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,920
Orwellian as anything happening in China

1258
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:35,710
and one of the other reasons that I keep

1259
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,440
talking about Social Credit is because

1260
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:41,560
if the west and I particularly am us

1261
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,750
focus but if the US continues to view

1262
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,150
their only notion of an autocratic

1263
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:49,930
meant to be one where everybody is

1264
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:51,760
walking around in fear beleaguered and

1265
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,620
in Chains we're going to miss the

1266
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,560
autocratic government that is taking

1267
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,359
shape right under our noses we have to

1268
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,020
understand that life can actually be

1269
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:06,190
quite comfortable under a in a non free

1270
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,050
State I think that there's a narrative

1271
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:10,810
that's that's developed over the last

1272
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:13,720
couple of years about this export of the

1273
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:15,549
authoritarian technology somehow I think

1274
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,290
I wish it's good to remember that these

1275
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,840
technologies themselves are agnostic

1276
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:21,820
they are not purpose-built for we should

1277
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,330
remember for example that we look at

1278
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:27,310
where a lot of advanced AI recognition

1279
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,200
security facial recognition security

1280
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:33,040
cameras are being exported to for

1281
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,740
example North West Africa to to Morocco

1282
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,170
why who is the actual client they're

1283
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:41,709
doing this so that they can comply with

1284
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:44,140
us war against you know the court war on

1285
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:46,050
terror mandates that insist that they

1286
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,609
have that number of AI recognition

1287
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:50,200
cameras in place and they can't get them

1288
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,730
anywhere else at a reasonable cost so

1289
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,399
they buy them from China and somehow

1290
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:56,680
this gets double booked in the in both

1291
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,220
columns we have to be very careful about

1292
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,399
that

1293
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,740
and I I think when she jogged - I mean

1294
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,360
if I if I made for a second I care very

1295
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,149
very deeply about what's happening there

1296
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,730
but we just have to remember I mean what

1297
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:12,010
is happening are extra legal detentions

1298
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:15,130
of people who are exhibiting suppose

1299
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:17,500
it's signs of Islamic extremism and and

1300
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:18,850
fasting during Ramadan would count for a

1301
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,590
party member out for a long time it's

1302
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:22,299
but you've not been allowed to or if

1303
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,460
you're a public servant if you work in a

1304
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,990
school in a university or anything like

1305
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,390
that you are not allowed to to faster

1306
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,970
and Robyn on but they face something far

1307
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,830
far worse than having their social media

1308
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,689
or their social credit score knocked out

1309
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,340
that's that's important to remember so

1310
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:40,750
it's a it's a red herring for a lot of

1311
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:44,350
other things okay question which goes

1312
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:46,890
almost into the same direction with so

1313
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,759
much video content publicly available

1314
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:52,690
internationally in the internet and

1315
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,820
like musically being bought by tic-tock

1316
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,800
how likely do you think that the Chinese

1317
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:01,910
government can apply the social credit

1318
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:05,690
credit system across borders and yeah

1319
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:09,609
regulate people's behavior that come to

1320
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,610
China for the first time in their lives

1321
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:18,140
yeah I I don't really believe that

1322
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,480
Chinese authorities are interested in

1323
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,490
that that there are already 1.4 billion

1324
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,670
people that and that's a lot of there's

1325
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:27,830
a sea of data and and a lot of that data

1326
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:31,220
nothing is being done with it if you

1327
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:33,590
look at apps like WeChat or tick tock I

1328
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:35,660
mean tick tock recently has been really

1329
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,380
popular in Europe and America too

1330
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,210
especially among young teenagers they

1331
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,890
are running on different systems so I

1332
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,720
mean it's still a Chinese app but it

1333
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:47,180
doesn't work in the same it doesn't have

1334
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,040
the same restrictions as it does in

1335
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,169
mainland China so basically there are

1336
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,300
two different apps of operating under

1337
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,360
the same name and also just to make

1338
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,230
clear these kinds of apps they don't

1339
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:00,320
take a score

1340
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:04,220
Alibaba does WeChat does if you are

1341
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:06,920
sorry Ali pay does if you opt into it so

1342
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:09,379
for example I have a score now it's 600

1343
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,510
it's not so good so I cannot get yeah

1344
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:14,060
I'm nowhere I'm nowhere but you still

1345
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,010
have to opt into that but who knows in

1346
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,029
the future I mean if it's commercial if

1347
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,430
it's about making money

1348
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,650
sure that could be the case that you opt

1349
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:24,410
into such a thing and then you can get

1350
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:26,720
some free books or some you know like a

1351
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,790
loyalty program sure but if you're

1352
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,549
talking about politically motivated

1353
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:33,770
scores for foreigners I don't believe

1354
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:36,260
that anything they will have a database

1355
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,990
on you anyway if you think you matter to

1356
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:41,120
the Chinese government I mean there's

1357
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:43,009
there's an assumption here that I think

1358
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,569
I find very disturbing is this idea that

1359
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,460
we should have some kind of

1360
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,190
extraterritoriality for foreigners

1361
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:52,070
living in China so somehow the social

1362
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:55,160
credit system even were it to exist in

1363
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,230
the most you know a full-fledged form

1364
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,720
that they of the Western imagining even

1365
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,480
if it did exist why wouldn't it be

1366
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,279
applicable to people living in China of

1367
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,550
course

1368
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,530
you can come to China and still although

1369
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:09,810
they're so I mean I think it's we she's

1370
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,370
addressed this question of people

1371
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:14,560
crossing border I mean of the app

1372
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,819
crossing borders into other markets we

1373
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,650
don't need to worry too much about that

1374
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,150
I think but I've seen a lot of other

1375
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,220
critiques suggesting that Europeans

1376
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,080
living in China would be would be

1377
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,509
subject to this and that is their

1378
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,390
primary objection to that that is a form

1379
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:31,030
of extraterritoriality that I think any

1380
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:33,250
reasonable person on reflection would

1381
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:39,640
realize is is not an acceptable thing in

1382
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:41,860
this post-colonial world next sorry

1383
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,529
first my English is not the best it's

1384
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:48,820
great I'm going to make a small comment

1385
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:51,480
first because I live in Cuba so for me

1386
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:57,760
short comment sure we always want to get

1387
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:59,710
thank you sorry system and I know

1388
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,680
because I live like that

1389
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:05,500
that when you use numbers to recreate

1390
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,549
situations that are developing this kind

1391
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,520
of systems not always the numbers give

1392
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:16,620
you a hulls perspective abduch for

1393
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:20,290
example in February Cuba make elections

1394
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:24,700
free elections according with the reform

1395
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:27,670
of their our Constitution and we had 7

1396
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:30,850
million voters and more than 6 million

1397
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:33,730
people both just for the Constitution 1

1398
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:36,580
Constitution that support the an out to

1399
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:40,060
target systems so if you use that number

1400
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:43,120
you can say that more than 88% of the

1401
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:46,390
Cuban population support system my small

1402
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,000
question is how closely are those

1403
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:52,049
through base that you are giving us the

1404
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,930
numbers if you are not including

1405
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:57,940
subjective elements like information

1406
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:00,669
what kind of informations receive the

1407
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,080
people in China inside China because we

1408
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:03,640
have a problem to you but we only

1409
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,759
received the information that the

1410
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,710
government wanted we receive I think

1411
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,290
that it should be the same China and if

1412
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:14,080
you do not include that how closely are

1413
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,710
that numbers it's my only one kiss Kenya

1414
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,359
that's for you yes

1415
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,670
I mean that's of course the topic that

1416
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,920
the state media doesn't discuss certain

1417
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:24,230
issues so Chinese citizens don't have

1418
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,050
much information I mean we looked at

1419
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,880
also ruled citizens there especially not

1420
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,220
very approving of the system simply

1421
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,819
because they don't understand them so I

1422
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:36,770
mean this is a topic and but even in

1423
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:39,470
interviews when we then actually explain

1424
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:42,410
to people what we mean and explain

1425
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:45,230
certain possible like risks that could

1426
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:49,308
arise for individuals and people were

1427
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:52,220
quite made their own like choices and

1428
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:54,650
they didn't seem so concerned it's just

1429
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,250
they have a lot of competing concerns

1430
00:57:54,650 --> 00:58:00,530
and this is at the moment it just hasn't

1431
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,750
affected their life so much yeah so

1432
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:05,690
that's really again the point these are

1433
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,359
very early initiatives and I mean again

1434
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:09,890
just the point about the government has

1435
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:12,500
a propaganda to increase the

1436
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,210
trustworthiness in society and people

1437
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,700
are concerned that they can't you know

1438
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:18,440
like trust their neighbors and so they

1439
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:22,129
see it as an additional tool to get

1440
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:27,140
information um okay thank you thank you

1441
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:28,910
next time my question is about I mean we

1442
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:32,058
started out with black mare and the

1443
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:34,970
dystopian side of things and you already

1444
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:36,950
mentioned that big data and algorithms

1445
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,808
do not play as big a role as we think

1446
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:42,710
they do and that we conflate many issues

1447
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:45,109
but I guess my question is what kind of

1448
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:47,240
role do they play do they play any role

1449
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:50,869
will they is it likely that they won't

1450
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:53,540
play one or are they just it's just an

1451
00:58:50,869 --> 00:59:00,109
idea that was transported by a bad

1452
00:58:53,540 --> 00:59:02,660
recording so in my mind knowing China's

1453
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:05,660
Criminal Procedure system there's no

1454
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:08,390
doubt that as algorithms improve they

1455
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,879
will begin to be incorporated for at

1456
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:12,920
least predictive policing like police

1457
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,049
everywhere hope that it will it's not

1458
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,839
there now and it's certainly not social

1459
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:20,000
credit right now social credit is about

1460
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:22,369
additions and subtractions in the local

1461
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,349
point systems and the black lists are

1462
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:26,480
really just that each regulatory agency

1463
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:28,240
has selected the most serious offenders

1464
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,420
to put on a blacklist for that

1465
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,279
industry I would say that I never think

1466
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:35,950
there will be a unified social credit

1467
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,770
score and the reason for that is I don't

1468
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:40,960
think it's useful to people it would

1469
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:43,750
actually turn big data back into small

1470
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,300
data if you couldn't tell why the

1471
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,980
someone had a certain score when you go

1472
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,500
into a restaurant and you see an A grade

1473
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:53,050
or a B grade you want to know that

1474
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,150
that's about the sanitation conditions

1475
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:56,770
in that restaurant you don't want to

1476
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:58,840
know that this place actually should

1477
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:00,910
have a failing grade but the guy gave a

1478
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,740
lot to charity and visited his grandma

1479
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:05,560
last week so we're gonna pop him up to a

1480
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:07,779
C people want data that's useful to them

1481
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:11,440
police want data that's useful to them

1482
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:13,990
now the problem is that in experiments

1483
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,330
in the US and elsewhere with predicting

1484
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:19,060
predictive modeling we've seen that they

1485
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:21,670
get a lot of false negatives and false

1486
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:23,890
positives actually where they're either

1487
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:26,500
being over under conclusive being

1488
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:28,960
inclusive and China will be less

1489
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,580
concerned about roping in some people

1490
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,380
who are actually innocent when their

1491
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:34,540
model says that they're guilty whereas

1492
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,920
the US might see the error in the model

1493
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,020
and say well this model isn't helpful

1494
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,520
let's put it aside but I don't think

1495
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,560
we'll ever have a universal algorithm

1496
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,330
but I certainly believe that China will

1497
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,060
do whatever it can to implement new

1498
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:48,549
technologies into furthering their

1499
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,170
existing models and again I would say

1500
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:52,600
that I think all governments will do

1501
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,510
this but outside of China

1502
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:58,540
there's civil society and often courts

1503
01:00:55,510 --> 01:01:01,060
that can challenge these programs and at

1504
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:02,110
the same time though our governments

1505
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,090
don't seem to be doing a great job

1506
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:07,090
planning for this we seem to be doing it

1507
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:09,910
reactively and reactive in a tech that's

1508
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:11,770
advancing this fast as AI and the

1509
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:13,359
biotechs honestly I don't think

1510
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:15,280
reactives going to cut it we need to

1511
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,760
start making plans before the tech is

1512
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,940
here thank you thank you and we have two

1513
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,780
minutes so the last question okay very

1514
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:27,940
fast business in China in this structure

1515
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,130
Department and have two things to say

1516
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:33,190
one is I worked a lot with numbers

1517
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:35,440
accident traveling whatever I never had

1518
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,030
the feeling they were objective like if

1519
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,230
I'm

1520
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,670
that's the thing when I just want to

1521
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,470
mention because I think when we speak

1522
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,330
about different culture and also how

1523
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:43,890
information I use there's a very

1524
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:46,020
different culture about this in China

1525
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:48,509
I guess you aware of that second one is

1526
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,550
I worked it up with like this typical

1527
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:53,190
middle-class wealthy Chinese and we

1528
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:55,500
talked a lot I also speak Chinese so it

1529
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,990
was very difficult to really get their

1530
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,270
opinion on things yeah so I just want to

1531
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:02,310
mention again I still see even though I

1532
01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,830
don't like the negative drive what is

1533
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:06,720
often done from the Western media that

1534
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:09,990
it is an impact on their freedom and

1535
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:12,180
they don't really have the chance live

1536
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:13,799
in China is there Chinese if they work

1537
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,520
in China and they have a Chinese

1538
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,230
Passport

1539
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,450
I don't think they have the chance to

1540
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:20,310
say openly what they really think so

1541
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:24,169
it's very difficult to do us away and we

1542
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:26,730
believe in the numbers to get in the end

1543
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:28,950
well to turn the statement into a final

1544
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:32,100
question lightning round I mean to what

1545
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,870
extent are Chinese like in Plato's cave

1546
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,420
they're inside the cave looking at the

1547
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,529
shadows they'd really don't understand

1548
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,290
what it's like to freely express

1549
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:42,060
themselves and and so the social credit

1550
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:52,560
system where ideas like that is more

1551
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:54,450
acceptable to them go thank you point of

1552
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,670
course and it's very difficult to get

1553
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:59,480
perfect information in a society where

1554
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:01,680
where a lot of information is censored

1555
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,820
that's that's clear I don't think you

1556
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,549
getting the argument from any of us

1557
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,950
about that that said I think that people

1558
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:10,590
who have spent a lot of time who have

1559
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,700
that sort of finger feel as the German

1560
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,950
word I'm not sure with a camera when

1561
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:16,859
it's held it's a great word though yeah

1562
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:21,299
who spent time and then really have a

1563
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:22,590
very good feeling have honest

1564
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,360
conversations with a lot of Chinese

1565
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,190
interlocutors in their native language

1566
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,380
and especially when you look like me and

1567
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,630
and there is that wall of talking to

1568
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,850
another a foreigner my sense is that

1569
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:35,970
this is not this does not surprise me

1570
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:39,210
the results that you need not in any way

1571
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:41,069
surprise me final thoughts I mean I just

1572
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,140
want to say what surprises me is

1573
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:44,700
actually why we don't discuss why the

1574
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:47,190
Chinese government uses much more

1575
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:48,490
effective ways to address the problem of

1576
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,260
trustworthiness

1577
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,359
not increase the law make it more better

1578
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:55,270
more enforce phille why not increase

1579
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:57,369
education and I find this really missing

1580
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:00,250
in the debate so why don't we focus on

1581
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:02,440
this and I mean I think this Social

1582
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,180
Credit government is just a second best

1583
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,820
tool and it's not effective it will not

1584
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:08,919
get the bad apple out of China's society

1585
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:11,770
and I think this is something very maybe

1586
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,930
the next year can discuss you know how

1587
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:19,800
to address the issue of making laws more

1588
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:19,799
effective and increase education yeah

1589
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,300
that I hope because of course like I

1590
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,630
said I talk a lot from the media

1591
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:30,640
perspective instead of always portraying

1592
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,619
it as a system that might be very

1593
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,810
problematic like you said in the start

1594
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:37,030
it might create problems and instead of

1595
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:39,430
as a lot of chinese state media say this

1596
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:41,020
is a social credit system could solve a

1597
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:42,759
lot of problems maybe the truth is

1598
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,680
somewhere in the middle maybe it's not

1599
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,119
that black and white either it is

1600
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,069
problematic or it will solve all

1601
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:50,290
problems who knows but I hope we have

1602
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:52,480
another chance in the future to see the

1603
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:55,210
updates and the developments I highly

1604
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,010
encourage everyone to come up to and the

1605
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,510
panelists after this discussion and

1606
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,520
introduce yourself talk to them more if

1607
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:02,740
you want to find out thank you so much

1608
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,040
for listening in I hope you found this

1609
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,040
interesting
