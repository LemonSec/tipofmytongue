1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,249
[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
a

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
[Music]

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:31,079
[Applause]

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:34,379
hello people hello so this thing here is

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:38,190
called Game of Thrones does anyone

8
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:40,829
watches this skin Wiccans yeah okay so

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,390
there are some people I I don't really

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,350
watch it and they made me watch

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,510
summaries of seven seasons for this talk

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,559
because we're going to make a comparison

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:57,390
with the EU political landscape and Game

14
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:02,250
of Thrones families today no no spoilers

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,110
spoiler free you shall worry not so the

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,869
reason why we thought that this is a

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,070
good idea is because EU topics are not

18
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:15,259
so popular to listen to and we really

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,419
think of 2019 as the beginning of a

20
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,479
perhaps a period in which Europeans can

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,840
get more hooked on to these topics stay

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,820
more engaged and follow a bit more

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,659
episodes of this real-life version of

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,149
Game of Thrones so today we have a

25
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,350
little plan for the next 20 minutes or

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,740
so we will speculate a lot about the

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,479
shifts in power balance in the EU

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,890
influenced by a new European Parliament

29
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,810
a new Commission obviously breaks it and

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,610
the impact we will talk a bit what is

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,590
the impact that this have on the way we

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,650
do advocacy in Brussels for digital

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,780
rights then we'll give a small overview

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:03,120
on the topics that we are planning on

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,549
focusing on in the next period yes but

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,650
before we dive into the details I just

37
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,400
want to give you a quick overview of the

38
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:15,150
main events this year so the next thing

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,409
to happen is on 15th of May where the

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,299
lead candidates have livestream debate

41
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:23,399
then of course very important the

42
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:28,920
European elections taking place between

43
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,290
23rd and 27th of May in July beginning

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,410
of July the European Parliament will

45
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,030
have its very first session

46
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:42,570
and we'll then later in July elect the

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,460
next Commission president so decide who

48
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,519
is going to sit on the Iron Throne

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,920
then in September October there will be

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,770
hearings of the appointed commissioners

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,690
and in October there's going to be the

52
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,590
vote by the European Parliament on the

53
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,590
next Commission scheduled for end of

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,510
October for now at least this brexit and

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,940
then first of November the new

56
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:12,149
Commission is going to take office so

57
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,400
but why are we actually here standing on

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,060
the stage talking to you about the

59
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,220
European Union well Andrea and I we both

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,720
work for European digital rights

61
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,970
Adri and short and you can call us the

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,580
small folk of Westeros if you wish

63
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,520
because we represent civil society

64
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:37,500
organizations from across Europe right

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,930
now there's 42 human rights groups from

66
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,600
20 countries that are member of a tree

67
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,630
and that defend rights and freedoms

68
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:50,160
online so in Germany you have for

69
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:54,269
example the CCC or the utilization of

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,900
the attack oh gosh v Wikimedia and also

71
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:00,650
fsfe that are members of a tree and yeah

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,110
and we work in Brussels I forgot to say

73
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm I can repeat that so we work in

74
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,650
Brussels and we were funded in 2002 with

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,870
a mission to protect promote and uphold

76
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,140
civil and human rights in the digital

77
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:20,548
sphere in 2001 we got this Brussels

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,539
office and we sorta say increased our

79
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,820
cooperation with the European

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,810
institutions needless to say we work in

81
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,290
European level and the last years we've

82
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,030
been focusing a lot on monitoring

83
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,490
legislative initiatives and assessing

84
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,489
the risks that they pose for freedoms

85
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,560
online and then intervening discussing

86
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,720
with policy makers about how we can

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,490
give those initiatives of better shapes

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,950
for a right so obviously 2019 is a very

89
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,070
special year for us because the new

90
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:57,010
European Parliament will impact who we

91
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:00,880
talk to when we want to talk to the

92
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,590
Commission will obviously affect also

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,139
the legislative initiatives that are

94
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:09,090
being proposed and breaks it will have

95
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,090
an impact too on the way we discuss on

96
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,810
[Music]

97
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:19,570
now yes a year with a lot of changes

98
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:23,500
overall we will see a lot of plot twists

99
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,930
betrayal murders revenge mainly because

100
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,840
the families the political families are

101
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,880
changing a lot Kirsten will get a bit

102
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,849
more into detail about that but they

103
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,900
will change names they will change

104
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,510
constituencies there will be a

105
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:43,450
battlefield of shifting alliances pretty

106
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:46,060
much breaks it will come with 75 MEP is

107
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,520
leaving the Parliament the British ones

108
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,470
but some of those remaining seats will

109
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,010
be reallocated to other member states

110
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,370
and in the end we will have 46 less

111
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,960
seats with seven hundred and five

112
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,640
members in the parliament standing

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,919
regardless of brexit happening the

114
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,950
right-wing political spectrum will see

115
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,030
an increase in seats bit more of the

116
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:15,969
overall aspect to this we will have 40%

117
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,650
or it is speculated that only 40% of the

118
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,169
members of the Parliament will keep

119
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,590
their seats the current ones which

120
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:27,669
states like France seeing even a higher

121
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:31,750
turnover only 25% of French MEP is

122
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:34,659
maintaining seeds finally we were having

123
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,910
our digitalized champions leaving the

124
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,820
Parliament such as Yulia red emeritus

125
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,610
arcane young Philipp Albrecht so we will

126
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,570
have to create new alliances with

127
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,690
perhaps

128
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:50,090
more and more of the pirates joining the

129
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:55,550
Czechs and the German ones we're

130
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:58,099
expecting four or five new people in so

131
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,860
as a disclaimer it's important to

132
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,110
mention that all of our speculations

133
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,780
today are based on knowledge that we got

134
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,510
from our personal contact with the

135
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,460
institutions but also reports as the one

136
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,349
shown here from the European Council on

137
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:22,489
Foreign Relations and public polls and

138
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:25,600
so on take it away yes so basically we

139
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:30,340
thought it would be easier and more fun

140
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,260
to well we would find a new way to

141
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,460
present European politics and the

142
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,650
upcoming changes to you by comparing the

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,539
biggest houses the biggest groups in the

144
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:45,349
European Parliament with the big houses

145
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,440
of Westeros of Game of Thrones that are

146
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:52,070
currently fighting for the Iron Throne

147
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,800
aka the Commission presidency so if you

148
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,200
are not following Game of Thrones then I

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,410
think it will still be understandable so

150
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,479
please don't leave and for those who are

151
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,860
following or who are trying to catch up

152
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,780
with a series

153
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,550
there will be no spoilers we promise so

154
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,159
in the European Parliament until very

155
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,920
recently you had two big groups that

156
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,710
formed some sort of big coalition the

157
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,300
EPP and the snd so the Conservative

158
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:26,239
Party and the Socialists and Democrats

159
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,660
that held a majority and well you could

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,370
compare them to the previous alliance

161
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,220
between the Lannisters and the

162
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,950
Baratheon's and then you also have a

163
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:40,160
couple of smaller houses the Starks the

164
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:44,140
tag Aryans the Bolton's and the

165
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:49,250
Greyjoy's but yeah let's go first to

166
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:52,220
King's Landing the seat of the EPP so

167
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:55,550
the EPP is the Conservative Center

168
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,300
rights groups and the German city would

169
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,339
say us

170
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,430
politicians they are part of this

171
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:06,750
political group they have held the Iron

172
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,030
Throne for the past 15 years so they had

173
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,160
the Commission presidency for a quite

174
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:15,240
long while and the EPP much like the

175
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,699
Lannisters they good at political games

176
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,640
and they do anything to protect their

177
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,820
family so they want to show unity even

178
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,410
though there might be yea disputes

179
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:31,560
cooking below the surface and yes many

180
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,480
polls indicate that the this grand

181
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,369
coalition with the s and D will no

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,250
longer have a majority in the next

183
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:42,840
European Parliament so that's a big

184
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:48,150
change and the EPP is well they might

185
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:51,960
lose seats currently they have 217 and

186
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:57,949
they might be down to approximately 189

187
00:09:51,960 --> 00:10:01,830
or even down to 182 if the Brits exit

188
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,540
and then also what was more recently in

189
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,710
the press the Hungarian party fetus is

190
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,569
suspended only for the time of the

191
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,300
elections and they might be back

192
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:16,800
afterwards because well the EPP cannot

193
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:20,400
afford to lose more seats right now

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,400
let's jump to storms and home to the

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,380
great house of the snd so the S&T

196
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,040
reunites the Socialists and the

197
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,850
Democrats and is center-left in

198
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:35,670
orientation and well in Germany the SPD

199
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,250
members are part of this group and like

200
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,640
the Baratheon's they once held great

201
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:46,830
political power but they are slowly

202
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:50,130
disappearing now so most polls project a

203
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:54,720
loss of seats of 40 40 seats less is

204
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:59,820
quite a quite huge they could even lose

205
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,440
54 seats of the British members exit so

206
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,749
it's basically the group that suffers

207
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,389
most from from brexit now let's move

208
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:12,990
Dragonstone yes where the house of the

209
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,209
Liberals is located so either which is

210
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,209
short for the Alliance of liberals and

211
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:21,689
Democrats as a centrist liberal group

212
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:24,239
and it has been a strong force a long

213
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:28,290
time ago and while the german ftp

214
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,230
members are part of this and in the past

215
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,740
months there were rumors that this

216
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:38,279
centre liberal group would fuse with

217
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,170
McColl's lovely public Amash so the

218
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,209
center might actually be back as the

219
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,259
third biggest force in the European

220
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:48,420
Parliament at least then it has also

221
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,059
been announced already that the name

222
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:54,509
Alda will disappear so this whole

223
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:58,290
central liberal group will be called

224
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:01,050
something else and macomb just like

225
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,360
Daenerys Targaryen they look like nice

226
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,719
people and they want to bring peace and

227
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,899
unity to to the world but actually well

228
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,069
below the surface it's they can be

229
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:16,110
pretty scary and but are a bit edgy and

230
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:21,269
they both want to fight the populace as

231
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:25,049
hell the polls show that while they

232
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:27,990
might be increasing seats then if my

233
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:33,089
Khan teams up with them from currently

234
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:35,399
72 up to 95 400 seats so the EP the

235
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,899
European Parliament will be finely

236
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,720
balanced between the three biggest

237
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,509
groups the Conservative Party the the

238
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,769
Social Democrats and the central liberal

239
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:51,360
yeah so let's move up to the north to

240
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:55,939
Winterfell home of the green group

241
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,519
so yeah the Greens EF a they unite the

242
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:02,189
ecological and left-wing groups and the

243
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,559
German business 960 Quinn and the German

244
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:07,349
pirate Giulia Veda they were they are

245
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,449
part of this this group so they were

246
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,559
really the first ones to alert us about

247
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:15,839
climate change and that winter is coming

248
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,740
and just as the Greens teamed up with

249
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,370
the

250
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,250
snd before well in the past the Starks

251
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,090
had an alliance with the Baratheon's now

252
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,950
that the Baratheon's are disappearing

253
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,690
they the greens are trying to well they

254
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,880
are growing and they try to defend their

255
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,560
own space with the rise of the

256
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,960
right-wing and extremist groups in the

257
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,910
parliament it's much more unclear how

258
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:47,880
the alliances will play out and well for

259
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,510
our topics for digital rights it could

260
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,490
be possible that there will be more

261
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:57,030
cooperation with the centre liberals but

262
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:00,090
it also depends which ones I guess in

263
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:03,420
terms of seats they might increase just

264
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:08,130
a tiny bit the polls indicate five seats

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:13,050
more or well they would say the same

266
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:16,380
basically with the Brits exit right in

267
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:20,130
the Iron Islands the Nordic Green left

268
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,950
is situated and just like the Greyjoy is

269
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,450
they're quite split internally they have

270
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,640
members they're quite fond of the

271
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:32,720
European Union some there are not so

272
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:35,640
much the left-wing party group

273
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:41,390
represented by the German d-link

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:44,790
from from the National German context

275
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:48,870
currently they have 52 seats and with

276
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:52,290
the UK standing during the parliamentary

277
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,560
elections they're expected to have 55 so

278
00:14:52,290 --> 00:15:00,260
a small increase after brexit we're

279
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:05,189
looking at perhaps than having 56 spots

280
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:07,439
these small your skeptics groups are a

281
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,250
very interesting thing to look at for

282
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,270
the next period we have compared them

283
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,490
with the Bolton's

284
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,350
because they have a tendency to do the

285
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,180
dirty jobs of the EPP s being a bit more

286
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,310
cruel a bit more populous than a bit

287
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,660
less diplomatic even in their discourses

288
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,709
individually they might seem

289
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,100
insignificant but

290
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:36,220
together their star is rising so this is

291
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,130
something to look very closely at the

292
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:43,600
ecrt conservative reference the FDD

293
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:47,620
the ENF some GUI members some unassigned

294
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,660
members and EAP n something I will get

295
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,890
back to all of these that I mentioned

296
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,120
are expected to be the second largest

297
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,410
ideological bloc in the European

298
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,630
Parliament over 35% of the seats will be

299
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,449
held by them and this will play an

300
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,730
important role now EAP n what I

301
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:11,730
mentioned earlier the European Alliance

302
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:17,970
for peoples and nations Springs from enf

303
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:20,520
it is expected to form as a group with

304
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,790
representatives from over 10 countries

305
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:28,689
including Liga Salvi knees Italian

306
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:33,490
deputies Sal Sal Venus Leah now if this

307
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:36,760
would indeed become reality EFT has high

308
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,250
chances to be dissolved and ECR will

309
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,970
most likely lose a lot of members who

310
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,000
will join this right-wing extremist

311
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:48,970
alliance as a group they're expected to

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,120
be fourth largest in the parliament and

313
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:57,190
even perhaps compete for the third spot

314
00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:01,300
with Aldi now when it comes to the way

315
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,760
decision-making is happening in the

316
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,480
parliament in this new context Kirsten

317
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,190
mentioned that des indes and the EP bees

318
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,530
even if they agree on something they no

319
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,810
longer held majority which means that

320
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,399
they need to invite others on the table

321
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,770
to reach consensus

322
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,620
this means that consensus will be more

323
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,050
difficult to reach this also has an

324
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,329
impact on international agreements to be

325
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,889
signed it is predicted that lot less

326
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:30,189
agreements will be signed because

327
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:36,930
Europeans position use position will be

328
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:40,840
more less likely to become concrete now

329
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:46,210
the group with the majority

330
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,850
with the power to get majorities in the

331
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,490
Parliament will also most likely have

332
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,600
the power in the European Commission and

333
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,510
will determine the president and Kirsten

334
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,020
also mentioned all of them having a very

335
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:06,640
important unique position in securing

336
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,700
majorities this is why it is perhaps not

337
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,010
too far stretch to speculate that the

338
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,850
power they get in the Parliament could

339
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:18,520
be traded for a president position in

340
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,520
the European Commission the presidency

341
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,129
has been EPP in the past 15 years and of

342
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,690
course EPP is still a strong candidate

343
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:31,480
for the European Commission with Webber

344
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,330
if he would be voted down after the U

345
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,610
council proposes him for the European

346
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,699
Parliament there is another strong

347
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,070
candidate the French Barnea coming from

348
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,890
the same ip P so EPP has very strong

349
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,990
first option and second option of course

350
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,070
there's the Social Democrats timmermans

351
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,049
who has been quite popular in the public

352
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,990
debate so far but politically speaking

353
00:18:53,049 --> 00:19:00,309
he doesn't really have any chances for

354
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:03,100
presidency now yeah right

355
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:06,280
so what are the impacts of all this of

356
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,199
all these changes on digital rights and

357
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,168
freedoms and on the way that we do

358
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,820
digital rights advocacy so all these

359
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:16,390
developments definitely make room for

360
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,189
new ways to influence a policymaking in

361
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,270
Brussels and this means that we also

362
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:27,130
need to find new ways and allies to win

363
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:29,440
political fights going to brexit shortly

364
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,909
in the short term nothing much will

365
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,230
change because the decisions of the

366
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,380
European Court of Justice still need to

367
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:41,110
be implemented there and the UK also has

368
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,450
a couple of national implementations of

369
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,270
new legislation such as the privacy

370
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,030
rules in the form of GDP our net

371
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,519
neutrality and so on and they will stay

372
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,918
in place

373
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,169
but with a full brexit in the long-term

374
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,740
the future of all these national

375
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:02,350
implementations is much more unclear on

376
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,399
top of this there is pressure to

377
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:09,789
deregulate IT companies because well the

378
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,008
UK needs to find a way to compensate for

379
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:15,309
the loss of access to the digital single

380
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:17,380
market and this of course might be very

381
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,289
bad for digital for our rights and

382
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,139
freedoms in terms of the changes in the

383
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:26,169
European Parliament so what do we do

384
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:29,049
when winter has come to the to the

385
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:31,480
institutions so some might think that

386
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:33,970
now we might need to start talking to

387
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,909
all these right-wing extremists and

388
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:39,309
populist and your skeptics and

389
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:42,129
what-have-you but we think that that's

390
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:48,519
not necessarily the only or the the best

391
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:52,019
solution first of all as Andrea said as

392
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:54,070
many old digital rights champions

393
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,279
parliamentarians that were fighting for

394
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,590
our topics leaving the Parliament it

395
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,179
will be very important for us to find

396
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:08,529
new people there and new allies and then

397
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:11,110
of course the center liberal group that

398
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:13,210
will have a king-making role in the next

399
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:17,789
parliament will also be an opportunity

400
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:22,419
to create majorities for for our dosas

401
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:26,649
and the changing political landscape

402
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:31,990
yeah you can go to the next one no I am

403
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:34,268
sorry about the National landscapes so

404
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,519
because the majorities in the Parliament

405
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:38,860
are not so easy to secure nowadays as

406
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,409
talking to people in Brussels will not

407
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,740
be enough this is why advocacy at

408
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:47,470
national level is crucial pressure needs

409
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,379
to come from the national level to

410
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:53,200
Brussels also and we know we have seen

411
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:55,899
from the copyright defeat that young

412
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,659
people care about a free internet we

413
00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:01,000
have seen that they can be active and we

414
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,320
have seen that they quite lost some

415
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,690
trust in the EU

416
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,320
so this means that we need to work

417
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:11,310
together at a national level to foster

418
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,070
pro-european messages to foster

419
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:17,649
communication between people and their

420
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:21,340
representatives and work together to

421
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,230
secure digital rights this is also a

422
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,770
quick shout out that if you do want to

423
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,560
get involved either come to our meeting

424
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:35,860
tomorrow our workshop on digital rights

425
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:37,840
or and or get in touch with your every

426
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,219
members in your countries the map is

427
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:47,290
also on our site that you've seen yeah

428
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,990
so now in terms of substance the

429
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:52,270
changing political landscape doesn't

430
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,400
only have an impact on how we do digital

431
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,590
rights advocacy but also on the

432
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:02,020
substance and on the files that will be

433
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:04,470
coming up so three main areas are first

434
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:10,300
of all platforms regulations secondly

435
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:12,640
security and thirdly privacy for the

436
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,120
first topic platform regulation it's

437
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,560
going to be an immensely important and

438
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:23,010
huge topic of the next term and it's

439
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:26,770
basically well the question is how

440
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:29,140
platforms can take down illegal content

441
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,550
and how they might be held liable for

442
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:37,090
what users upload to the to to their

443
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,100
networks to their well services it

444
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,870
started a bit in the past years with the

445
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,350
copyright and the terrorist content

446
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:47,669
debates but in the next term this is

447
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,260
going to be a much broader discussion

448
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,920
yeah and the thing is that the

449
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:58,000
centre-right doesn't really like the big

450
00:23:52,920 --> 00:24:00,220
US tech and so it might it's possible

451
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,950
that there will be more efforts to focus

452
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:07,510
on the big players which doesn't sound

453
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:10,380
like a bad idea per se but if the

454
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:13,840
legislation is badly drafted and if

455
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,970
smaller players and media for within the

456
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,679
scopes and there could potentially be

457
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,340
huge collateral damage for our rights

458
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,710
and freedoms so the main file that we

459
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,870
will be seeing in this area is the

460
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:29,890
reform of the so-called equal mess

461
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:32,500
directive which will be renamed I think

462
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,770
as we heard into the digital Services

463
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,930
Act and then part of this whole platform

464
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,780
regulación discussion of course is the

465
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:44,860
question of algorithms how they are used

466
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:48,280
by platforms and how transparent or how

467
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,830
discriminatory they are when it comes to

468
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,930
security we already know by now that

469
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:57,010
terrorism and cyber security are

470
00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:00,850
prioritized on the EU councils policy

471
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:03,910
cycle for 2018 2021 with the rise of

472
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:07,360
right-wing political ideologies in the

473
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:10,180
European Parliament it's not again far

474
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,899
stretch to guess anti-immigration and

475
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,170
surveillance law will be quite hot in

476
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:20,800
the next period again we're also looking

477
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:23,650
at data retention being reborn a file

478
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,399
that every members have killed in the

479
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,590
past in the EU Court of Justice the

480
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,960
third thing Kirstin already mentioned

481
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,110
the regulation on online terrorist

482
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,440
content currently this has been upheld

483
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:41,320
in the European Parliament after a guess

484
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,560
what content filter on on line terrorist

485
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,620
content has been proposed so far it's it

486
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,440
hasn't gone further but the risks is

487
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,199
still there so it needs further

488
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,920
monitoring final thing is a evidence

489
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,870
that refers to law enforcement agencies

490
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:04,300
accessing data cross-border and this is

491
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:08,310
a ongoing file that will also be

492
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,620
monitoring in the future yes now privacy

493
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:14,590
so there will be still of course some

494
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,199
major privacy fights to win currently

495
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,490
there's a reform going on that's called

496
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,520
a privacy privacy reform and that

497
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,290
defines basically how

498
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,050
well the confidentiality and the privacy

499
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:31,570
of your electronic communications and

500
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:35,860
then there's also going to be a need

501
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,320
again to defend encryption if we've seen

502
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,330
in Germany recently that law enforcement

503
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,159
pushed for prohibition of Tor and the

504
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,220
German bonus had also discussed the

505
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,710
proposal to criminalize tor hidden

506
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,220
services so that this might be coming up

507
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,160
at you level as well especially since

508
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,860
France and Germany tried to push for

509
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:05,560
encryption backdoors back in 2017

510
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:09,850
already so yes so we're nearly at the

511
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,879
end of this talk yes final slide it

512
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,949
doesn't look so good for European

513
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,430
democracy and our digital rights in the

514
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,350
next term but then again I mean we

515
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,470
thought many times before that the end

516
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:27,639
was near for digital rights but we still

517
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:30,190
kept on fighting and looking back the

518
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,820
you actually did also some good things

519
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,160
for our rights and freedoms so and then

520
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,620
since the last legislative term we have

521
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,650
stronger privacy rules in the form of

522
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,870
gdpr we have you wide net neutrality

523
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,510
protections and more recently also

524
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:50,439
whistleblower protections so it's not

525
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,420
all doom and gloom so we've been we kept

526
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,800
telling you how winter might be coming

527
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,780
and now we're telling you that actually

528
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,790
the EU is really great and it's been

529
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,250
doing good things for digital rights and

530
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,530
really the truth is that the EU is what

531
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,290
you make out of it so even if right

532
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:08,139
wing's right-winger ideologies are on

533
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:11,170
the rise and even if winter might be

534
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,020
coming it just happens that we are quite

535
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,330
fond of winter sports and just like any

536
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:20,139
other winter sports

537
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,419
it requires the sports require good gear

538
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,570
and good practice and we've got the

539
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:28,930
practice so we're asking you to give us

540
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,750
that good gear go out and vote competent

541
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,910
candidates for the European Parliament

542
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,710
so we have good people that we can work

543
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,539
with

544
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,789
and we believe that with our practice

545
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,460
and the good gear that you're giving us

546
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,360
is really we can survive any winter

547
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,360
thank you

548
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:57,880
one more thing one more thing we have a

549
00:28:55,269 --> 00:29:01,269
digital rights meet up tomorrow at 12:30

550
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,309
at meet up space 1 and there if you have

551
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:06,250
more questions you can ask us all about

552
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,740
it because well the 30 minutes were not

553
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:13,590
enough time of course to go into details

554
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,590
so yeah thank you guys thank you

555
