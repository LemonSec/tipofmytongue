[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
a

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
[Music]

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,809
hello welcome

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,809
[Music]

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,750
I have the great pleasure today to

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,449
introduce one of the most feared

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,280
Europeans in Silicon Valley

10
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:44,468
she's the pop star among your

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,969
commissioners in Brussels I have the

12
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:50,850
pleasure to introduce to you my great

13
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,850
vestroia the UK vision of a competition

14
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,780
well so you have held a portfolio for

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,880
competition since 2014 as a commissioner

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,190
you have made big headlines across

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,929
Europe with the billions of euros in

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:18,450
fines you hand it down to large tech

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,520
companies among other things in 2016 he

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,840
gave his thirteen billion euro fine to

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,979
apple on a tax case and that was

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,409
probably what grabbed a lot of people's

23
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,009
attention including the American

24
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,759
president who said reportedly you ready

25
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,380
use tax lady who really hates the US

26
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,259
actually I did fact-checking on that

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,720
statement because it's correct I work

28
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,899
with tax and it's correct that I'm a

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:51,929
woman but except from that the rest is

30
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:54,360
completely untrue and to just to

31
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:57,899
continue the introduction you also find

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,929
Google with billions in three major

33
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,690
cases the most recent one was just

34
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,149
concluded a few weeks ago with a fine of

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,109
1.5 billion euros for abusive practices

36
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,239
in online advertising and in your tenure

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,800
the Commission investigated all of the

38
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,459
big tech companies practically I think

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:22,950
and The Economist called you the world's

40
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:25,980
most powerful trust buster and more

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,690
recently you have become kind of one of

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,819
the frontrunners of the European

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,430
liberals party and that is something I

44
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,170
would like to talk to you more about

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,930
what your prospects are if you're gonna

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:42,599
lose you from the Brussels scene very

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:44,040
soon or not and just to mention just

48
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,980
really briefly but I think it's it's

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,420
interesting your career before process

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,369
was also quite outstanding you were

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,319
elected to Parliament and became a

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,099
minister of the Danish government before

53
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,890
you were 30 I think you went on to lead

54
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,470
the party the social liberals you were a

55
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,208
minister of government then again as a

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,109
Minister of economics he also made a

57
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:10,319
reputation as a fierce as a fierce

58
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,970
Minister there as well and you're said

59
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,480
to be the inspiration behind

60
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,730
the TV show bargain which

61
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,290
interchangeably you're mentioned or high

62
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,470
Latonia schmidt who was then Prime

63
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,070
Minister we would have to add asked Adam

64
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,720
pre sir the creator about that but in

65
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:30,690
any sense there's one kind of my

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,460
favorite episode of Oregon which deals

67
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,380
with the picking of a new commissioner

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,250
and is called in Brussels no one hears

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,590
you scream but if the intention was to

70
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,090
neutralize you politically didn't quite

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:48,500
work at must say so in the next half

72
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,780
hours we will discuss fairness and

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,940
competitiveness in the digital world in

74
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,780
essence the question of how to deal with

75
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:02,040
these big tech corporations and their

76
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,450
huge market power and dominance if

77
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,989
anyone in the audience wonders why this

78
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,869
is so important have a look at the list

79
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,880
of the largest stock market traded

80
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,350
companies in the world and you will find

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,219
them to be in the current as a first it

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,390
may set up Microsoft's Apple Amazon

83
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,260
alphabets the parent company of Google

84
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:26,669
and Facebook so each of these companies

85
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,979
in their own ways

86
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:33,419
dominates any number of services and

87
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,360
it's I think it's a big question for us

88
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,490
a society of how to deal with that and

89
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,270
after our chats I will open the debate

90
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,850
to the audience here in Berlin with us

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,219
and also solicited a couple of questions

92
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,360
from Twitter and I think it will be a

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,150
lively debate so which brings me to my

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,430
first question I would like to debate

95
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,010
with you the historical perspective of

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,690
the situation we find ourselves in the

97
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,180
situation you as a regulator find

98
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,260
ourselves in so in a recent interview

99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,630
with Franklin fir for the Atlantic you

100
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,669
like in the current economic situation

101
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,240
with that of the Industrial Revolution

102
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,740
back then we had large trusts we had

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,720
standard oils and

104
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,919
the telephone companies and the

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,729
electricity companies who quickly formed

106
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,099
monopolies and I think that was the

107
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,900
first time we realized as a society we

108
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,910
have to do something about that that's a

109
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,090
situation that's terrible for consumers

110
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,620
it's terrible for competitors it's

111
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,000
really only good for the people who

112
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:43,320
holds the monopoly power and so some

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,699
people say scholars economists just read

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,130
a piece in The New York Times today by

115
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,039
The Economist who won the Nobel Prize

116
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,830
last year saying that in some ways this

117
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,280
is a very anti-competitive situation for

118
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:59,758
which we need remedies and I guess my

119
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,349
question to you is to what extent are we

120
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
in just the situation we had an

121
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:06,389
industrial revolution and do we need as

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:13,549
a society to to be a lot tougher on

123
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:13,550
these large tech corporations yes

124
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,680
the thing is that we are extremely

125
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,540
challenged because the scope and the

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,150
pace of this industrial revolution that

127
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,030
we're in is so much much faster than

128
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,880
ever before and it's everything that is

129
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:40,900
influenced it's our friendships

130
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,550
it's our democracy it is agriculture

131
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,370
transportation health government

132
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,830
manufacturing all strains of our society

133
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,680
that is changing because of the

134
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,960
technological revolution and we're not

135
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,430
done yet because we haven't seen the

136
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,888
real effects of blockchain technology

137
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,280
quantum computing or the Biosciences

138
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:09,700
that is pushing as well so it's about

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,039
time that our democracies starts shaping

140
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,560
the road for our future societies

141
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,099
because otherwise we leave it in the

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:24,220
hands of companies that are completely

143
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:25,720
out of democratic control but now you

144
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,960
use a commission I handed out these

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,570
large fines but and also ordered some

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,580
remedies for the markets non competitive

147
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,560
situations that were created but to some

148
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,969
extent these companies move so fast and

149
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,520
they have only accumulated power and and

150
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,220
and and value since you start at the

151
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,930
office so do you think that in any way

152
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,630
the political responses are adequate to

153
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,599
the situation we're in I mean and they

154
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,130
you know larger than ever

155
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,830
well there is part of the answer comes

156
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,080
from enforcing competition law because

157
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,409
you get a fine - fine pass illegal

158
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,510
behavior in the decision also we have to

159
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,190
stop you cannot do something to the

160
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,409
equivalent and what you did before your

161
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,530
wrongdoing and competition will then

162
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:15,160
have to come back what we see is that it

163
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,739
takes very little time to destroy a

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,800
markets it takes a lot of time for a

165
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,289
market to push back and this is why we

166
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,510
are looking into well how can we how can

167
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:29,020
we change that because we need to gain

168
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:33,069
speed as law enforcers as well

169
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,199
so we've had huge conference we have had

170
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,630
a call for public contributions I've had

171
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,060
three special advices looking into

172
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,189
questions of platforms data and

173
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,270
innovation and especially when it comes

174
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,220
to data I think that is a key issue

175
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,069
because access to data is what allows

176
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,320
you to be competitive to be relevant

177
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,480
because you can't have excellent

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,940
technology you know cutting-edge the

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,610
best possible if you have no access to

180
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,000
data you will not be able to provide

181
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,100
services to potential customers

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,520
and this is why access to data and

183
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,100
access to data also as a remedy in in

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,890
cases where companies have have done

185
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,300
something illegal I think that is one of

186
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,399
the things that we will be approaching

187
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,589
because then you can have real

188
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,470
competition and then you can figure out

189
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:25,839
how to challenge the network effects

190
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,300
that we see so clearly and all the

191
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,540
effects that comes from new ways of

192
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,810
generating value right let's talk about

193
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,640
one specific case in that vein so Amazon

194
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:41,529
is being looked at by the Commission for

195
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,480
basically looking at what competitors

196
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,200
third parties who sell over their

197
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,310
platform are doing and then allegedly

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,730
replicating some of the behavior taking

199
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,290
insights from other people's sales for

200
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,930
their own brands and basically out

201
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,349
competing them on their their

202
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,140
competitors on their own platform so the

203
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,670
question is I mean it has been a good

204
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,770
gig case about Google shopping as well

205
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,329
so we know the platforms are in some

206
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,810
ways doing this or at least it look it

207
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,630
appears they are doing this that beggars

208
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,699
the question when companies favor their

209
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,500
own products they just use their their

210
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,110
market power in that way

211
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,580
[Music]

212
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,640
can you tell us a little bit more about

213
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,740
the Amazon case specifically and also

214
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,590
like look at more like how could these

215
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,000
non monetary sanctions these remedies

216
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,040
exactly look like how could this

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,860
data-sharing look like for a small

218
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,240
company for us as customers but you're

219
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,440
completely right what we're looking at

220
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,710
is this situation where Amazon is both a

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,480
host and a competitor because of course

222
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,890
it's great if you have a small brick and

223
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,590
mortar shop that you can also do

224
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,650
ecommerce so you're hosted by Amazon

225
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,900
they help you out payment shipping but

226
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,569
they also get all your data they know

227
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,610
what your customers are looking at they

228
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,800
know what you sell they know what is

229
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,080
trending and they also do that because

230
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,870
they are hosting so many small

231
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,810
businesses so we're trying to figure out

232
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,120
do they use that data in a fair way or

233
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,489
do they use that data actually to

234
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,010
compete against you because they know

235
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,830
exactly what is trending coming from

236
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:26,660
yourself and that we're in the process

237
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:29,180
of looking into and the quite nice thing

238
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,969
about that is that we send out then a

239
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,949
lot of questionnaires and all these

240
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,530
smaller businesses then they help out

241
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,800
they have business to do and yet they

242
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,839
take up time to send us their data their

243
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,300
information for us to be able to crunch

244
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:47,030
the numbers we're not completely there

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,170
yet but we've also been thinking about

246
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,480
what is this actually going on and one

247
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,329
of my advices Helga Schweitzer will be

248
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,550
well known here in Germany she sort of

249
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,030
said well maybe you could understand

250
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,829
this as the equivalent of a sports union

251
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:06,199
so the sports union will set the rules

252
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,930
of the game they will take care of

253
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,060
anti-dumping issues the ethics of the

254
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,870
game but they will not not have their

255
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,579
own team they will host the teams they

256
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,290
will make the tournaments they will make

257
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,320
the championships they will make sure

258
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,480
that the ethics are of the game is fine

259
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,050
but they will not themself participate

260
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,260
and this is a very well-known logic that

261
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,760
gives not this dual approach as we see

262
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,160
some time on the platforms

263
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,890
but a much more simple approach because

264
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,560
if you're dominant well then it is you

265
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,960
who actually regulates what is going on

266
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,420
on your marketplace on your platform

267
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,060
Justin leader sports example was also

268
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,959
used by Elizabeth Warren Democratic

269
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,150
presidential candidate who suggested

270
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,940
that exactly this situation that the

271
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,250
platforms are their own that they want

272
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,110
to be empires and at the same time

273
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:05,750
competing the game is clearly so

274
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,510
violating of our principles of fairness

275
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,640
that we should break up these companies

276
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,470
and she said that for instance Facebook

277
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,330
should be made to divest again of

278
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,150
whatsapp a company they only bought five

279
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:20,000
years ago although it now seems like

280
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,680
near eternity so do you think yo you're

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,680
a bit cautious of this idea of breaking

282
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,339
up the companies he said in in in South

283
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,540
by Southwest festival in Texas you said

284
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,200
that this should be a measure of last

285
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,939
resort but when exactly you know do we

286
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,400
come to this point where the last resort

287
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:42,460
is the only one left well in our laws it

288
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,720
will be a measure of very last resort

289
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,220
and the thing is that what we are

290
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,230
looking for is of course things that

291
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,300
works yeah because we would want

292
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,880
competition to come back if companies

293
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,290
are destroying the marketplace so what

294
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,740
we're looking for is what will it take

295
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,959
to push back in a marketplace because

296
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,730
the risk if you consider breaking up a

297
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,830
company this is the most far-reaching

298
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,590
thing that you can do to take private

299
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,320
property and say now we say you should

300
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,050
organize differently and of course since

301
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,450
that would be a reversible process I

302
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,400
think the court would listen very

303
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,740
carefully and they say well maybe wait

304
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,650
and see so you will be spending you know

305
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,110
maybe years in courts before you would

306
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,060
actually have an effect of what you were

307
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,640
doing and this is what we've been

308
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,939
looking into this issue of access to

309
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:36,150
data because if you can give a

310
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,640
in a decision access to data that will

311
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,980
allow you to have the same competitive

312
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,840
pressure and what has been going on this

313
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,480
make this marketplace you may have a

314
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,730
fair chance of making it because the the

315
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,800
sad thing or the tricky thing in the

316
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,830
absence case the latest google case is

317
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,810
that google stops the illegal behavior

318
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,840
when we set them to statement of

319
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,729
objection two years ago and what they

320
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,860
did was that they asked for premium

321
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,290
placement of their own ads on

322
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,970
third-party websites if you have a

323
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,329
travel website and you have a small

324
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,280
search box then google would say well my

325
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,620
art should be in the premium placement

326
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,790
made it very difficult for anyone else

327
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,130
to place ads on that kind of websites as

328
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,829
such two years ago when they received

329
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,530
the statement action they stopped but

330
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,330
that market hasn't picked up at all it

331
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,160
is the same as when they stopped their

332
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,010
behavior and this is of course very

333
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,500
thought-provoking because this is what

334
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,500
will it then take for other companies to

335
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,390
push back and get into this market which

336
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,520
is a very important market because here

337
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,949
you can get a head start also to be

338
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,620
relevant for more customers in general

339
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:49,800
search so this is what we're thinking

340
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,010
about well is is access to data one of

341
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,709
the things that would allow rivals to do

342
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,880
better and be much more relevant for the

343
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,490
people they do business with

344
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,680
I mean there's a philosophical argument

345
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,640
that when you when you talk about access

346
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,589
to data you essentially treating the

347
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,050
companies like a public utility you're

348
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,420
already saying that everyone has the

349
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,699
rights to access them to be carried on

350
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,530
these platforms I talked to the writer

351
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,940
quarry doctor of a couple of kids

352
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,970
there's ago and he made the very good

353
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,590
argument that in some ways if you treat

354
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,380
them as public utilities it will also

355
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,380
make it very hard to break him up so we

356
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,600
it it's kind of a fork in the road it's

357
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:35,430
it's either or do you see it's that way

358
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,120
well we've been trying to see if you can

359
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,180
use the logic of a public utility

360
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,050
because for instance we allow or enable

361
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,510
competition about those who deliver

362
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,459
electricity so if you want

363
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,920
- very often you can buy electricity

364
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,350
that is exclusively from renewable

365
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,930
sources but we don't ask the same

366
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,480
competitors to build a new grid they can

367
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,430
use the same grids as anyone else to

368
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,200
provide us with electricity because

369
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,439
otherwise they would never get to it

370
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,089
we can have competition on rails

371
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,980
different rail providers but they will

372
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,629
use the same tracks because the tracks

373
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,550
well they are there and you cannot ask

374
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,630
anyone else to build new tracks because

375
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,990
otherwise they would never get to

376
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:18,780
compete against you but the tricky thing

377
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,760
is what will be the effects of saying

378
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,209
that for instance Google search is a

379
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,010
public utility that's just a tricky

380
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,840
thing how - what would then be the

381
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,580
effect of it and how to enable it and

382
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,480
this is why we are thinking more about

383
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,639
this if you have an illegal behavior if

384
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,860
you're a dominant company well that has

385
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,380
a consequence and that may be sort of

386
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,510
more straightforward getting to the

387
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,610
result that we want that's other

388
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:50,310
businesses will have a fair chance of

389
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,600
competing that of course entails that we

390
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,550
as consumers are sufficiently curious to

391
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,270
do something else than just stay locked

392
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:02,399
in in our small universes so how many

393
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:06,330
have recently tested another search

394
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,210
engine it's a very tech-savvy crowd

395
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,449
whenever we see a couple of hands but

396
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,780
but this is a very good show and you saw

397
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,570
how few people actually did that there

398
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,720
is a German search engine clicks there's

399
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:25,429
a French one quote they both provide for

400
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,350
much better privacy than anyone else

401
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,600
this should be the crowd to test it yeah

402
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,850
use quant I think I have read in

403
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,590
interviews yes yes there's another

404
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,350
example of this that I wanted to talk

405
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,679
about it's that the example of me and

406
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,659
messenger services we most of us use

407
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,090
whatsapp or signal or telegram or

408
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,700
whatever and the Commission recently

409
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,139
published is very interesting paper

410
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,230
competition policy in the digital era

411
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,290
and there you could read an interesting

412
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,230
chapter but what is in the jargon called

413
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,190
full protocol interoperability so the

414
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,750
idea that

415
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:04,410
the messenger service should be opened

416
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,180
like emails so that when I use my granny

417
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,610
uses whatsapp I can send her a message

418
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,160
from telegram and all these services

419
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,139
would be interoperable so do you think

420
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,510
that that that is something that

421
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,540
European Union should regulate or should

422
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,670
use existing powers to regulate because

423
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,000
I have not heard anyone in Germany you

424
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:26,220
have justice minister Bali proposed this

425
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,080
but there hasn't really been a large

426
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,480
political debate so should we have one

427
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,429
but I think this is this is very

428
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,420
important because this is exactly what

429
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:38,790
can make sure that we break out of sort

430
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,760
of the confinement of just one service

431
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,740
one universe and not keep inviting other

432
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,750
people in because that's as part of the

433
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,360
network effect that we say well I'm on

434
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,100
whatsapp I would like to exchange

435
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,260
messages with you so would you please

436
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,570
come on what sunbirds well but maybe

437
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,300
your preferred services would be signal

438
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,580
or telegram or something else so if we

439
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,669
could push for that then we would also

440
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,980
have a very different approach and we

441
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,960
know that from text messages there we

442
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,600
can send text messages even though we

443
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
have very different providers different

444
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,760
type of telco companies so it's a

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,190
completely well known way of doing

446
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,670
things and it's also what allows for

447
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:23,100
real multihoming and multihoming is also

448
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,620
what I think keep us open to new

449
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,230
services innovative services and

450
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,600
products that other businesses would

451
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,060
like to give to us and that can only

452
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,169
happen when they can work together yeah

453
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,169
and so

454
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,769
so would you say from your experience as

455
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:48,590
a regular at the regulator over the past

456
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:51,620
five years that your toolbox was large

457
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:54,559
enough that you had the resources you

458
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,529
needed to do the job or would you say

459
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,970
that in the next commission and the next

460
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:02,929
Parliament we should think about

461
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,639
enlarging regulatory competition toolbox

462
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,399
but also going beyond the mere

463
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:12,320
competition field to deal with the

464
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:14,389
dominance of tech companies but to some

465
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,158
degree we can our tools are quite

466
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:22,008
flexible like in the Google Android case

467
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,200
we use the same logic as a case from the

468
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:26,659
seventies where it was a time between a

469
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,639
nail gun and nails you know two very

470
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:32,480
sort of relatively simple physical

471
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:35,928
products same logic when Google tied the

472
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,080
Play Store with search and browsing so

473
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:40,519
our tools are quite flexible but of

474
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:44,389
course we need to push in the

475
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:46,999
understanding of how we use some and we

476
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:48,469
may us also have to consider how to make

477
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,990
sure that we get to see the right

478
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,299
murders because when we did the Facebook

479
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,429
whatsapp merger and the Microsoft

480
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,840
linking murder we did that because

481
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:59,539
national competition authorities

482
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,039
referred it to us otherwise we wouldn't

483
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,809
have seen it because they're below the

484
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,970
threshold they may have very little

485
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:07,340
turnover when they're being bought and

486
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,769
if you look at for instance google has

487
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,570
been on a shopping spree in in europe i

488
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:15,200
think over the last couple of years they

489
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,860
have bought 175 200 companies here we

490
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,230
don't see that never so maybe we will

491
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,809
have to consider in some areas to see do

492
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,539
we have the right tools actually to see

493
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,230
and know what is going on that being

494
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,929
said in the next seven year budgets we

495
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,759
from the Commission has proposed to have

496
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:37,669
a larger budget for for the kind of work

497
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,100
that I do because my services they of

498
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:43,600
course also need to digitalize as well

499
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,939
to have our own tools maybe our own

500
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,399
algorithms to be able to police what is

501
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,929
going on and in that respect I think

502
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:53,810
it's very important that we have

503
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:56,360
sufficient resources because we need

504
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,980
people from different with different

505
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,620
skills coming from different strands of

506
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,720
life in order to be effective in what we

507
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,060
do mm-hmm but in you have the national

508
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,950
competition authorities were very often

509
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,360
comparatively small but they they play

510
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,610
an important role in feeding you

511
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,590
information cases but do you think that

512
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:16,040
Member States should beef up also their

513
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:19,490
competition muscle well I've only had

514
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,220
one alleged proposal in these five years

515
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:26,060
and the one is the proposal now passed

516
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,610
and it was the first regulation 2019 it

517
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,260
was to empower member states in their

518
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,120
national national competition

519
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,030
authorities to have sufficient resources

520
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,129
to be independent to be able to take all

521
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,820
kinds of evidence because previously

522
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,170
some national competition authorities

523
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,649
they couldn't take digital evidence

524
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,780
which is kind of strange because not all

525
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,810
catalysts have a little book where their

526
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,510
rights what they have decided so we're

527
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:55,370
pushing for that and I just learned that

528
00:23:53,510 --> 00:24:00,100
that in Denmark now they have a

529
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:02,780
dedicated platform office platform unit

530
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,439
because we deal with the big platforms

531
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:09,110
but I think in Europe you'd find around

532
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,030
7,000 different platforms so of course

533
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,909
you would like fully to understand what

534
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,760
happens with competition how are we well

535
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:20,360
served by the markets when platforms it

536
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,720
becomes the basis of how businesses are

537
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,310
doing their business and now crossing

538
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,950
over to topic that I deal with a lot as

539
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,450
a journalist I write a lot about I'm a

540
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,330
correspondent in Brussels and I write a

541
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:37,430
lot about lobbying now I nearly never

542
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:39,290
see people in Brussels who work for

543
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:41,140
Google of Facebook to to media are

544
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,430
nearly invisible what I see is there a

545
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,830
footprint I see how often they meet

546
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,260
people from the Commission how often

547
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,590
people that are in their pay or

548
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,049
associations that wear their member meet

549
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,290
meet with various public officials so I

550
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:59,150
think it is fair to say that the

551
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,580
lobbying footprint is very high of these

552
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,140
companies that they often better

553
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,189
informed and most journalists that they

554
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:11,690
take part in the policy-making process

555
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:15,950
in in a lot more ways than you know many

556
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:17,299
of the political parties do so you have

557
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,679
been face to face with with these

558
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,260
companies you have been face to face

559
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,850
with their CEOs the the tech pros when

560
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,780
one has to say because they tend to be

561
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:29,918
men so do you think that we should work

562
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,168
harder to insulate European lawmaking

563
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,000
from the corporate power of these big

564
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:39,429
tank companies that they also this way

565
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,429
they have over over the policy process

566
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,390
but the first thing is that transparency

567
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,210
is that it's the best cure against undue

568
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:53,150
influence and the second thing is that

569
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,929
public consultation is a very important

570
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,190
part of our legislative process and here

571
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:02,929
it doesn't cost anything to participate

572
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,880
and I think that's a very important

573
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,460
point because a lobbyist comes with the

574
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,309
mark as a lobbyist

575
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,799
I need very few lobbyists because very

576
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:15,649
often in our case what we would want

577
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,530
businesses to change so you would want

578
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,000
the CEO the decision-makers because the

579
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,059
lobbyists they don't take decisions they

580
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,280
promote a story that when colleagues

581
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,470
meet with lobbyists it will be from

582
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,678
people registered in the lobbying

583
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:32,210
register the meeting would be registered

584
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,750
and it will be public that it has taken

585
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:39,080
place but that being said I think it is

586
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,270
important that more people engage in the

587
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,629
legislative processes engage in our

588
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:49,070
public consultations because of course

589
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:51,110
you need a balanced view but when

590
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,250
working with colleagues internally I

591
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:58,290
think the proposal and also the end

592
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:00,630
results with Parliament and and Council

593
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:04,800
has been an expression of our democracy

594
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:07,710
and not what is the will of the lobbying

595
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,169
parties but still they their their their

596
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:13,080
influence is pervasive and as you know

597
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,940
the I think there has been a lot of

598
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,439
progress in trying to get the same kind

599
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,270
of Lobby transparency registered that

600
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,750
the Commission has for the Parliament or

601
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,639
for the council so in many ways we can

602
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:26,880
only guess at just how much influence

603
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,820
the companies have and all of these are

604
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,580
foreign and there are American companies

605
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:36,020
you have to debate now but Huawei and

606
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,939
Chinese company so don't you think that

607
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:42,210
there's more than transparency needed to

608
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,810
deal with the corporate power of these

609
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:47,700
companies well first of all it's a very

610
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,560
good point that the Parliament ought to

611
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,480
have the same rules of transparency as

612
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,540
the Commission because then it would be

613
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,580
more obvious who's talking to who the

614
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,810
second thing that is that good

615
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:06,120
legislation is informed very broadly

616
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:09,149
also with with with those who are going

617
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,010
to be affected by the legislation and I

618
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,320
think it's it's more important to have a

619
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,240
balanced approach than to say that there

620
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,550
are some specific people that you will

621
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,620
not talk to because even though you

622
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,080
don't do as people want you to do you

623
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,479
still learn a lot from what they say of

624
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,610
the way they're thinking what they would

625
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,200
want you to do and that kind of

626
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,590
information I think is very very

627
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,120
important but the important thing of

628
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,709
course is that you get something in

629
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,709
between and that you have the

630
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:40,260
independence from that kind of money

631
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:44,460
and that kind of influence to do what

632
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,930
you find is the right solution cycling

633
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,230
back a bit to the national governments

634
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,940
now you had we had the you blocked the

635
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,790
merger of Siemens in Houston two very

636
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,410
large companies this kind of riled a lot

637
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:58,100
of politicians or at least a few in

638
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,750
Germany in France and there was talk of

639
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,639
shouldn't we allow more leeway in

640
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,710
competition policy have less stringent

641
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,590
enforcement to allow for the creation of

642
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,090
national champions now the German

643
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,139
conservatives put it in their election

644
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,149
program

645
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,960
not only calling for national champions

646
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,440
but also calling for digital champions

647
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,880
so I understand your you you find this

648
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,530
idea a bit suspect of giving more way to

649
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
larger corporations but do you think

650
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,730
that in some way that argument holds

651
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,620
water that when you have all these

652
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:35,400
digital companies almost all the big

653
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,290
ones are American that we need to kind

654
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,170
of create more competition breathing

655
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:43,379
space to have a similar type of European

656
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,419
corporations in the digital okay well I

657
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,730
think that the problem has been that we

658
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:51,690
were not we were not thinking about what

659
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:54,750
will it take to her to grow a big also

660
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,669
digital business in Europe it's it's

661
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,250
only recently that we have established a

662
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:03,120
digital single market so that it also

663
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:05,940
makes sense to think garage global from

664
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,830
a European point of view it's only now

665
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,740
that we're trying to push for a European

666
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,860
capital market to be there when you go

667
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,350
from startup to scale-up

668
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,510
because Europe doesn't lack talent if

669
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,540
you look at the startup scene and the

670
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,070
ecosystems they have changed to very

671
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,830
large degree there's a completely

672
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:29,520
different dynamic now than just 10 years

673
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:32,129
ago but but we need scale and you need

674
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,260
capital and one of the things that has

675
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,330
been holding European businesses back in

676
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,160
the scale-up process is that when you

677
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,770
need capital very often its depth

678
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,380
finance so you go to the bank you

679
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,480
establish yourself a debt instead of

680
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,280
going to the markets maybe with five or

681
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,470
ten percent of your business

682
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,590
to sell that and you don't only get

683
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:55,100
capital you also get competence because

684
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,629
it takes a lot to scale up a company

685
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,928
sometimes also more than what the

686
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,990
original entrepreneur and the team

687
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:06,500
around him or her would be able to do so

688
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:09,570
we're trying to provide for the

689
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,630
necessary conditions in order to grow

690
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,570
businesses but again we we can do

691
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:20,260
something sort of systematically we can

692
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:22,770
address market failures like in the

693
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:27,790
important projects of microelectronics

694
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:30,670
but we also need customers we also need

695
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,940
citizens to say well I I will I will not

696
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:37,990
be happy I will not be satisfied with

697
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:40,780
what I am presented with we would want

698
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,640
to take control and if you look at the

699
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:47,080
the digits of citizen right that we got

700
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,180
last year the GDP are I think many

701
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,040
people share my frustration that it's

702
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,710
great to have rights but it's even

703
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:00,580
better to be able to exercise them and

704
00:31:53,710 --> 00:32:04,960
if we want a that could have given a lot

705
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:08,500
larger applause I think no but the point

706
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,070
is to say that if if we want a data

707
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:15,280
democracy then a lot of things will have

708
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:17,919
to happen also among ourselves to say

709
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,139
well we will not only wait for low-end

710
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,450
forces and politicians to sort dessert

711
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,490
we want to be part of this process and

712
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,860
we want to be part to take the

713
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,990
opportunities that comes with it because

714
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,740
otherwise we will also not have the

715
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:35,380
necessary information actually to know

716
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:38,350
what it is that is going on this is

717
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,390
actually a preview a question from the

718
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:44,020
audience I got on Twitter before

719
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:47,140
somebody wrote well you know GDP is

720
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:50,139
exactly this case as you said we it's a

721
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:53,080
great law but it has the enforcement

722
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,660
strategy has been sometimes left wanting

723
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,720
or so maybe for the lack of resources of

724
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,160
the regulators but now how do you see

725
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,860
this from the point of view of the

726
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,590
Commission where you sit there and you

727
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,909
might take a very muscular approach but

728
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:12,310
then the Commission very often either

729
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:14,550
has no sway over national authorities to

730
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:18,520
properly implement the laws or the

731
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:20,800
Commission itself might prefer self

732
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,710
regulation as in many fields they have

733
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,470
done in digital policy in anything from

734
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,119
dealing with hate speech or this

735
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,879
information

736
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,799
but also dealing with things like the

737
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:35,678
commode charger for smartphone so do you

738
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,820
think that in some ways we haven't

739
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,460
really thought through our enforcement

740
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,499
strategies do you think that

741
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,519
self-regulation was kind of the wrong

742
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:47,649
track for many of these issues well I

743
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,440
think the approach is changing because

744
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:53,498
if you if you look at the rules that our

745
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,059
our national data protection agencies

746
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:58,210
are now policing they have much more

747
00:33:55,059 --> 00:34:00,519
teeth than what they used to have Google

748
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:05,049
gotta find by the French Data Protection

749
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:07,029
Authority of 50 million euros for not

750
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:10,509
being clear and transparent about how

751
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:12,940
data is being protected so I I

752
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:16,329
completely agree it is working progress

753
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,760
but there is progress the second thing

754
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:21,790
is that I think we need we need also the

755
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,990
market to pick up here because one of my

756
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:27,549
frustrations would be that if I I'm very

757
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:29,888
often advised to say well you can just

758
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:32,259
change the settings of your phone not to

759
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:35,290
accept cookies well then I de facto

760
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,480
disabled the phone so I wouldn't do that

761
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,219
so when I come to a webpage they say oh

762
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,679
you can regulate you too with your

763
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,299
cookie setting then I'll have to do that

764
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,339
I would like to have a digital assistant

765
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:48,009
on my phone who would know my

766
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:50,619
preferences and automatically make sure

767
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,440
that those preferences they were

768
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:56,319
accepted because we still have a long

769
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,369
stretch to go before all our services is

770
00:34:56,319 --> 00:35:03,430
made with privacy by default so we here

771
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:06,640
we both need a regulatory response and a

772
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,680
market response because here there is a

773
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,058
market opportunity and that ought to be

774
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,058
a driver I have mentioned it before but

775
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:18,819
the new European search engine part of

776
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:21,010
their drive to be launched is actually

777
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:25,270
to be designed with privacy by default

778
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:26,799
and that push is very important it is

779
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,780
thought that we ought to be helped by

780
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:31,000
scandals but I think that the scandals

781
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,980
for instance of Facebook analytical was

782
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,040
a wake-up call with no snooze

783
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,400
a lot of people realize that oh this

784
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,859
privacy it may not be so innocent that

785
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,170
they actually are

786
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:45,660
very good reasons to protect yourself

787
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,779
because if you protect yourself actually

788
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,328
you also protects our democracy let's

789
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:56,940
see I think I think it's a very good

790
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:59,099
point but I mean talking about Cambridge

791
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,690
analytic exactly there we had um we

792
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:02,069
didn't have a very strong response that

793
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,719
we have European elections coming up in

794
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:07,049
a couple of weeks for 500 million people

795
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,680
were voting but we still have this kind

796
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:12,299
of patchwork tumble work of 28 different

797
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,459
electoral laws most of them have no

798
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:16,559
bearing on digital advertising don't

799
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:19,009
regulate it in any way the platform's

800
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:23,549
have rolled out their own version of

801
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:25,319
transparency but do you think that here

802
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:28,229
that response has been entirely adequate

803
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:32,640
to leave it to the platforms to make the

804
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:34,558
new rules no but I think in in lack of

805
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,019
common rules I think it's better that we

806
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,719
have some awareness about what is going

807
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:43,049
on and and a number of platforms also

808
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:46,440
the bigger ones they will now sort of

809
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:48,839
mark political advertising there's still

810
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,309
some stretch to go because you would

811
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,558
also want that marking on content

812
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:54,089
because there's not only those who are

813
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,979
responsible for that Betar thing that

814
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:59,119
can be political also when it comes to

815
00:36:55,979 --> 00:37:02,009
the content from somewhat opaque

816
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,279
responsible people you would have the

817
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:08,699
same mocking but when when there is a

818
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:11,069
sort of resort to a more voluntary or

819
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:14,519
self regulatory approach it's because of

820
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:17,849
speeds because sometimes it's better to

821
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,709
have some solution than to wait for the

822
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:22,940
for solution why having everything just

823
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:25,769
become wild and wilder in the mean time

824
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,539
so the next Commission should ask for us

825
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:32,008
the member states for very comprehensive

826
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:34,349
joint framework for electoral rules but

827
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:36,479
I think indeed that the next commission

828
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:38,670
will have to take sort of the

829
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:40,640
technological revolution as one of the

830
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:44,489
Givens that will have to inform

831
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,819
everything we do because I said it is in

832
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:49,380
our elections it's in our culture

833
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,910
interaction it's in research it's in

834
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,730
agriculture it is

835
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,069
in everything we do that the world is

836
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,050
changing and if we want our democracies

837
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,050
to set the direction this is now

838
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,120
[Music]

839
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:13,740
so before I hand over to the audience

840
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:16,330
a bit about your political future now

841
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,939
you have had a great run as a

842
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:22,120
commissioner at least according to many

843
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:26,770
people but now your tenure is coming to

844
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,270
an end and it's not entirely well to say

845
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:32,710
the least entirely certain if you will

846
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:35,200
return to Brussels so for for you to

847
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:39,240
come back to Brussels as a commissioner

848
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,240
as a commission president to some hope

849
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,220
can you describe a little bit about what

850
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:50,710
what would need to happen to make this

851
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:53,350
this event possible well somewhat would

852
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,220
have to want it to happen not to state

853
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:59,799
the obvious no the thing is that I am

854
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,259
from the social liberal family and we

855
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,080
have set up a team for the European

856
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,930
election to say well these seven people

857
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,270
five women and two men represent sort of

858
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,160
the social liberal family in order to

859
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,590
sort of try to say well who is who in

860
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,140
Brussels is important but the most

861
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,080
important thing is how we want to deal

862
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,210
with climate change with how to stay

863
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,700
competitive how to have a bigger global

864
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:29,740
footprint as Europeans how to be more

865
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:31,629
confident and I know is very interesting

866
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,200
who's who in Brussels but I think for

867
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:37,360
most voters not top of mind

868
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:44,069
top of mind is to figure out how do we

869
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:46,290
deal with this world so thank you

870
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,990
so we have tried to set that aside

871
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:51,090
because I think one of the things that

872
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,830
people are really turned off is if an

873
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:56,280
election is about who's going to have

874
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:58,500
what job and anyway you know I have

875
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,000
fallback positions I have been flying so

876
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,220
much in my mandate that I can be

877
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,760
planting trees for probably a decade to

878
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,759
make up that

879
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:15,700
excellent so who here has a question for

880
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,100
commissioner vest a guy I see some hands

881
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,169
here already over here over there well

882
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:24,460
but maybe we cannot take one from the

883
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:27,310
from from the yeah okay great

884
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,980
sorry hi I I took your point very well

885
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,810
about Alexander put my question to you

886
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,130
about about whether we're gonna make it

887
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,680
harder to break up the companies and

888
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,390
that might be hard I think though that

889
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,640
you'll admit that making companies

890
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,770
smaller will make them smaller and so

891
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,779
given that do you worry that some of the

892
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,820
regulations like Terra reg and the

893
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,470
copyright directive put a floor under

894
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,510
how small we can make these companies

895
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,580
because the duties require the largest

896
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:59,260
companies to perform that excuse me to

897
00:40:51,580 --> 00:41:01,930
perform them well one of the reasons why

898
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:05,200
I think there is a risk of a situation

899
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,940
as in this legend of the Hydra you know

900
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,529
you cut off the head and bouff you have

901
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:14,440
seven new ones is that you have the

902
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,150
network effects and we're very conscious

903
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,670
of the fact that you can have a dominant

904
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,620
position in this market way before you

905
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,750
would have sort of the market share that

906
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:24,279
sort of in an old-school economy would

907
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:28,330
suggest to us that you had a dominant

908
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,280
position and in the discussion for

909
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:33,600
instance about the copyright directive

910
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,740
there's been a I think a very strong

911
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,950
sensitivity to exactly at this point

912
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,319
well how can you make sure that you get

913
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,689
the balance rights so that smaller

914
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,360
companies they have one set of rules and

915
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:49,360
bigger companies they will be obliged to

916
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,540
do more also as a reflection of the fact

917
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:56,050
that in Europe there's no ban of success

918
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:58,509
you're more than welcome to do good if

919
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,360
if consumers like what you're doing you

920
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,610
grow but and that may be a very European

921
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,240
approach as well if you're successful

922
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:09,220
you get a new responsibility if you're

923
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,740
strong if you are in power you have a

924
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:15,040
special responsibility not to misuse

925
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,520
that power against others and I also see

926
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,308
sort of the the end of the

927
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,990
copyright discussion as an expression of

928
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:27,000
exactly that also when it comes to the

929
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:29,430
digital citizens right the GDP are you

930
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,960
have the same that if you're a small guy

931
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,210
sort of your native processing

932
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,900
obligations would be different from the

933
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:38,910
big guy but I'm not at all claiming that

934
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,460
this is perfect I think it's working

935
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,410
progress if you look at the platform to

936
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,890
business proposal it is set to be

937
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:50,279
reversed not reverse revised after 18

938
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:52,799
months in order for the legislature to

939
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,109
have a real sense if they got it right

940
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,809
or if the market is moving on without

941
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:59,730
this being sufficient for businesses who

942
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,940
do business with platforms actually

943
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:05,280
having transparency to know what is

944
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,619
happening if all of a sudden they cannot

945
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,760
be found anymore by a search engine or

946
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:12,180
the platform where they're doing the

947
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,770
business the copyright directive is

948
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,118
really very contentious I think

949
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:20,099
especially in this product we had some

950
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:23,940
debates in the last few days but mning

951
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:26,760
that then where their potential kind of

952
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,349
like potential for fallacy is very high

953
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,950
for the commission that you you walk

954
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:35,460
into something that you know in some

955
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:39,799
years you will regret that the article

956
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:42,299
13 day 3:17 created this obligation to

957
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:43,980
to monitor content on the Internet in

958
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:46,319
some ways for the companies that that

959
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:51,869
entrenches their power and that has been

960
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:55,500
the argument well as you say it's it's

961
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:58,589
difficult to to to judge now because the

962
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:02,490
regulation will only come into effect in

963
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:03,869
the beginning of next year but for the

964
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:07,288
people have been working the first hand

965
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:09,809
with this which is not me the intentions

966
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:11,609
has been exactly to say well you have to

967
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:14,700
make sure that if you make money on

968
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:16,828
other people's contents you will have to

969
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,230
make sure that you remove those people

970
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:22,349
because very few people come from the

971
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,400
advertising well I may do once a year to

972
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:29,549
see those five ads out of the FNL Finals

973
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,840
to just see why it is that they pay such

974
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:33,450
big amounts of money

975
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,310
for that display in the US but except

976
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:37,500
from that I come from the contents and

977
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,720
why is that that content providers

978
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,740
shouldn't be paid for what they do and

979
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:46,049
and I think there's there's also debate

980
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,899
about how do we actually see the

981
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,760
internet because for me from the sort of

982
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,750
very first days of the Internet of the

983
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:57,330
freedom of the ability to connect of

984
00:44:53,750 --> 00:45:00,840
creating a a community that was just

985
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:03,180
completed a different degree free we're

986
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,820
in a very different place today first is

987
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,810
a very commercial place very very

988
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:13,170
commercial place second you have a new

989
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:16,650
world of harassment that didn't exist

990
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,240
before I just read that in in some

991
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,210
places you find women who are very

992
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,040
reluctant to run for public office

993
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:25,590
because of harassment and threats that

994
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,950
is found two completely different degree

995
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:31,380
in social media than what it was in the

996
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,839
real world and I think we need that sort

997
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:38,130
of also sobering debates about what it

998
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,320
has become and how again to make the

999
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,630
best of it but we will never make the

1000
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:53,690
best of it if we do not get in control

1001
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:55,860
of the dark sites or what is going on so

1002
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,710
have more questions from the audience I

1003
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:02,010
hope yes I two years ago I was working

1004
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,480
with Amazon in a low-level software

1005
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,700
service

1006
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,910
so I know what they know about the

1007
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,819
consumers and they know about the

1008
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,859
co-workers the workers and I found out

1009
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:18,390
that there is a decision of the European

1010
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:21,450
Court of Appeals agreed so that says

1011
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,500
that everybody has the right to go to

1012
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:29,460
the court or to make to call if he has

1013
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:33,060
been damaged by a market market strong

1014
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:35,430
or monopoly company and so I I

1015
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,140
calculated that Amazon was paying me

1016
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:41,009
less than

1017
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:43,950
tariffs that there is that is normal in

1018
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:48,990
the in the place in the business at that

1019
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:51,600
side so I figured out that I could go to

1020
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,790
the to the authorities and I wrote a

1021
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,940
letter to Sigma Gabriel that was a

1022
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:59,340
former minister he didn't answer but I

1023
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:03,450
also wrote a letter to the competition

1024
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:07,020
authority and they answered it's not

1025
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:10,080
their business to for consumers the

1026
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:13,320
torture' it's it's a very very strange

1027
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,120
Anthony I got it's not the business for

1028
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,820
consumers it's the business of the

1029
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,040
ministry for consumers not so they

1030
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:23,310
didn't understand what I what I said I'm

1031
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,940
an employee and I figured out that the

1032
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:30,630
company is not that is hard a harming me

1033
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:34,110
is made me a damaged because they didn't

1034
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:36,150
pay me in the right level but they

1035
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:38,970
didn't do anything so the government

1036
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,760
didn't do anything in the point so I

1037
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,589
think we shouldn't call them monopolies

1038
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,950
they should call them champions we

1039
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,530
should call them dinosaurs because there

1040
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,750
will be coming a big bang the

1041
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:54,090
economically big bang it's around the

1042
00:47:51,750 --> 00:48:01,920
corner and I think that button that will

1043
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:04,250
destroy these big dinosaurs that remains

1044
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,250
to be seen

1045
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:12,730
but but the point second the point

1046
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:15,400
second that there is cause for in my own

1047
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:19,210
home country Denmark we have very strong

1048
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:22,110
social partners and and they I think

1049
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:25,900
would say well here there's a call for

1050
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:28,060
taking a company to court for instance

1051
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,370
there is if there is a big construction

1052
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,920
work and you have subcontractors and

1053
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,779
these subcontractors will not live up to

1054
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,130
their obligation they would be taken to

1055
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:41,500
court but as a consumer you would have a

1056
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,230
right as well if you take the truck

1057
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:47,830
cartel we have the six main truck makers

1058
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:50,280
in Europe catalysed for 14 years they

1059
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:55,180
had to pay a huge fine I think it was

1060
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,830
was his 4.8 4.8 billion euros but that

1061
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,450
was just part of it because the other

1062
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:03,310
part of it that now they're faced with

1063
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:05,379
numerous numbers of litigation for

1064
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,330
private damages because so many

1065
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:10,060
transport companies in Europe they say

1066
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,650
well we could have done better if it

1067
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,020
wasn't for your counsellor for you

1068
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,870
customizing and that's also part of the

1069
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:20,100
deterrence that you shouldn't do things

1070
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:22,569
that are illegal because yes eventually

1071
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,029
regulates a non-forcible court and we'll

1072
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:28,750
catch up with you but also the risk of

1073
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:31,890
private damages will be there than to to

1074
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,100
damage you to to make it right to people

1075
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,410
yeah

1076
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,690
there's a lady in the back there awesome

1077
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:41,290
Asma God's codes here that engage to the

1078
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,720
add-ons I deliver thanks Ron I'll try to

1079
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:47,380
be bold and I'll ask two questions in

1080
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,060
February you had cut it down to one

1081
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,860
would it would it be possible so that we

1082
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,080
have I can have get other people as well

1083
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,300
that's a toughy okay all right in

1084
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,740
February you had a conference called

1085
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,540
shaping competition

1086
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,189
I watched it i streamed it was highly

1087
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:04,930
interesting one of the high points was a

1088
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:08,440
keynote from John T Hall who was a Nobel

1089
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:11,080
Prize econo economist right and he said

1090
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,640
that I think the whole keynote is great

1091
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,230
it's still accessible everybody should

1092
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,368
watch it I think it's 20 minutes was

1093
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:20,289
really good

1094
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:22,029
said that he said that not all issues

1095
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:24,220
that we're seeing here with the market

1096
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:27,039
the market distortions can be solved by

1097
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,480
antitrust and competition law I was very

1098
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,730
happy that that was being said because

1099
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,519
the German Ministry of economics point

1100
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:36,460
is I will just beef up the national

1101
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,288
antitrust enforcement agency and will

1102
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,140
beef up competition law and that's that

1103
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:43,269
I think there's a lot of part of the

1104
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,490
issues that we're facing our neighboring

1105
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:48,450
problems that are outside of the scope

1106
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:52,419
of competition law to current will do

1107
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:54,399
well are you coordinating this because

1108
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,829
that is as far as I understand outside

1109
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,049
of the reach of DG competition are you

1110
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:01,269
coordinating with the other Commission

1111
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:02,710
Ares about these kind of market

1112
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:04,990
distortions because I think you're right

1113
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,940
we have market failures that cannot be

1114
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:09,839
solved by competition law but they need

1115
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,369
to be solved elsewhere

1116
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,460
but that point is completely well taken

1117
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:18,009
you know even though with the power is

1118
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,720
coming from 500 million Europeans it's a

1119
00:51:18,009 --> 00:51:23,369
big hammer but that doesn't make

1120
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,149
everything a nail and and this is why

1121
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:27,970
competition law enforcement and

1122
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,249
regulation will have to go hand in hand

1123
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,930
this is why we need the platform to

1124
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:34,089
business proposal this is why we need

1125
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,769
two new deals for consumers this is why

1126
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:38,049
we need sort of the regulation that

1127
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:39,970
comes and then sort of saying well this

1128
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:42,400
was the case work now these are the

1129
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:44,669
rules for everyone we have had it for

1130
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,069
instance with the fees on credit cards

1131
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:50,920
we had a number of cases with credit

1132
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:53,230
card fees that were way too high and

1133
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,839
that then turned into regulation that

1134
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:57,579
now regulates and put a cap on the fees

1135
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,859
that we pay with our credit cards and

1136
00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:02,319
it's the same method you have the case

1137
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:04,839
that shows that something has to be

1138
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,239
dealt with and the case is concluded and

1139
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:08,558
then you have legislation that will then

1140
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:14,640
frame the whole thing and give it

1141
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:14,640
direction so next question over here

1142
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:23,029
hello in the beginning you were talking

1143
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:26,089
about the example of Amazon and we had

1144
00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:29,779
two scenarios and one was the sports

1145
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:32,869
union metaphor where Amazon wouldn't be

1146
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:36,289
able to partake in the same competition

1147
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:40,519
on the on the own platform anymore and

1148
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:45,650
we also talked about that fairness could

1149
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:48,589
be accomplished via data distribution to

1150
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:51,249
all competitors so I think that's two

1151
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:54,709
scenario so I don't quite understand

1152
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:58,160
which one would you be pushing for so is

1153
00:52:54,709 --> 00:53:00,499
it Amazon that cannot partake or cannot

1154
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,719
sell on the on the own platform anymore

1155
00:53:00,499 --> 00:53:05,359
or is it more that they have to share

1156
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,940
all their insights about trending sales

1157
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:11,569
because I think it would be very

1158
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:14,180
difficult for Amazon to decide or what

1159
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:16,609
is kind of a secret that we just have

1160
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,440
and what should be open to the public I

1161
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:21,019
mean obviously they wouldn't want to

1162
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,869
share it but even if we say hey you have

1163
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:28,640
to share it how would we know if they

1164
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:31,069
share 100% of what they should but

1165
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,690
that's a very good point but before we

1166
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:35,239
have to make any of that choices of

1167
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:38,089
course we have to prove that Amazon is

1168
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:39,920
doing something wrong and we're still in

1169
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:42,038
the phase where we're crunching data to

1170
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,630
see well what will actually be the case

1171
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:46,489
and the reason why it's a good time to

1172
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,890
have this discussion is of course also

1173
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:51,529
to inspire businesses as to how to they

1174
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,509
themselves think about what they will do

1175
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:56,390
in in the future behavior

1176
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:58,430
how will they set up a platform what

1177
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:00,949
will be the kind of responsibility they

1178
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:03,499
will get if they becomes a dominant

1179
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,900
platform because the thing is with

1180
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:07,698
dominance then you become the factor of

1181
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,670
the rule setter and this is why this

1182
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:14,239
example with the sports union for me I

1183
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:16,579
think is a it's a relevant framework for

1184
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,369
your line of thinking so I think that

1185
00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:20,599
you will you will see in the future

1186
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:24,469
different outcomes depending on the

1187
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:27,099
cases because data sharing the things

1188
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,099
can work together

1189
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,140
is is part of keeping the market open as

1190
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,830
such and the digital citizens rights GD

1191
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:40,950
/ R is not in any way against data

1192
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:43,619
sharing or data coming together in large

1193
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:46,529
pools it all depends on the way you do

1194
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:49,349
it and I think that for Europe it's a

1195
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:51,810
strong point to say well we will push

1196
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:54,839
for innovation but we will do that in a

1197
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:57,630
way that respects European values and

1198
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:59,640
one of them is fair competition it's in

1199
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,640
the treaty it was there from the very

1200
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,799
first days and this push I think can

1201
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,109
come with different types of solutions

1202
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:11,970
in different cases and this is why I

1203
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:13,980
this is not the point yet to choose we

1204
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:17,098
have one last question that would be

1205
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,080
great I know sorry about um I really

1206
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:20,790
have to intercede here we had three men

1207
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,920
asking questions before so I would like

1208
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,869
to get at least one other non man to

1209
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,869
exhaust I'm sorry for for the

1210
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:32,420
intervention here and there's a lady up

1211
00:55:27,869 --> 00:55:32,420
in the front with a red sweater perhaps

1212
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:44,260
you know I really like this I I very

1213
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:52,180
often have to say in an audience I also

1214
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:54,010
take questions from women okay thank you

1215
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,379
very much for your talk I would like you

1216
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:58,660
to elaborate a little bit more on the

1217
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,640
idea of data sharing because this idea

1218
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,370
of a mandatory data sharing has been

1219
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,000
brought up by several people so what

1220
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:10,589
kind of data is it only aggregated data

1221
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,680
also metadata data from data analytics

1222
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:18,010
how do you make sure the balance between

1223
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:20,319
data protection and data opening data

1224
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:22,200
aggregation and I think what's very

1225
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,750
important is to think about

1226
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:30,339
intermediaries like a fiduciary trust to

1227
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:32,800
keep respect to maintain respect for

1228
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:35,410
data protection and for the interests of

1229
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,410
the consumers or citizens so I think

1230
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:41,129
what's really important is to have a

1231
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:44,620
representations of users of consumer

1232
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:47,350
organizations within this data sharing

1233
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:52,049
exercise because if we don't make sure

1234
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:55,779
about that I think this is a lost case

1235
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:59,860
but that I think is very well put I

1236
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:03,370
think in in India as part of their sort

1237
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:05,350
of process of enabling digital identity

1238
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:07,210
for each and every citizen which is a

1239
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:10,450
great progress because if you have an

1240
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:12,880
identity then access to school public

1241
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:15,000
services or that is much easier in that

1242
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:19,360
process they also established

1243
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,210
fiduciaries sort of an entity in between

1244
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,960
those who wants access to data and the

1245
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:28,780
dates are coming in to be an independent

1246
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,100
honest broker in that relationship I

1247
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,620
think that can be one of the

1248
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,720
inspirations I think it can be organized

1249
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,609
in different ways also I don't have sort

1250
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,450
of the fall technical over you as to how

1251
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,970
to make that happen

1252
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,529
also because sometimes it's not only

1253
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:45,790
that you will have users coming from

1254
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:48,100
sort of the same line of data creation

1255
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:50,830
but you will also have different sorts

1256
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:53,049
of data could be data that is not

1257
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:55,660
strictly personal that

1258
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:58,990
is created because the way we personally

1259
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:01,450
interacts but it could also be inferred

1260
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:04,990
data it could be data that are publicly

1261
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:07,990
funded like data on weather or national

1262
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:10,029
geography or it could be the Internet of

1263
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:11,950
Things data all the data produced by all

1264
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,930
the many machines around us and in order

1265
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:16,569
to do that you may want to make

1266
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:20,379
different setups as to how to enable it

1267
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:23,380
but for many different businesses access

1268
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:28,510
to data and sharing of data would be

1269
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:31,180
sort of the consumer would benefit the

1270
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,370
consumer because then the barriers to

1271
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,839
entry in that market would be so much

1272
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:37,359
lower

1273
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,430
take for instance aquaculture where you

1274
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,800
have seeds pesticides and machinery

1275
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:43,899
coming together the machinery will

1276
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:47,200
combine data from weather soil quality

1277
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,890
house eats response to different kinds

1278
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,689
of treatments if if that data is

1279
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:55,000
preparatory if it's owned by only the

1280
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:57,730
one who produces the machine it will be

1281
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,710
very very difficult for anyone else to

1282
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:02,560
enter that market and it would make the

1283
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,930
farmer left with very few choices but to

1284
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,779
do as the machinery is suggesting and

1285
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:10,000
this is why access to data becomes a

1286
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:12,070
great benefit for the consumer so

1287
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,890
there's also a sort of weighted

1288
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:17,860
interests that we're very often it will

1289
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:21,660
be the interest of us as consumers as

1290
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:24,100
citizens that they tell being shared

1291
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:26,109
well I think we have to wrap up the

1292
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,319
session now it was such a pleasure to

1293
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,640
have you here to talk about these issues

1294
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,650
we might see you again next year as a

1295
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,749
commission president or

1296
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,749
[Applause]

1297
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:45,110
or maybe just as concerned citizen but

1298
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,870
that being said I would be happy to come

1299
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:49,760
back in in any position because this is

1300
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:52,888
a great event

1301
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,889
