[Music]

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,160
a

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
[Music]

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
you

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,900
okay so

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:36,910
thank you for coming it's an unusual

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,769
setting for an academic and 15 years 20

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,510
years ago when I started my work in this

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,220
area

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,890
this kind of event would not have not

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,489
have happened the room either would have

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,890
been empty or we would have had a

13
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:55,569
collection of of lawyers and civil

14
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:58,870
servants so they have an opportunity to

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,559
speak to abide a range of of interests

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,280
in this area is it makes me willing to

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,600
go through this hurdle

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,430
I'm not a innocent party in here I in

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,979
somebody's been a participant in the

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,390
information of the directive so I've

21
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:20,470
been at numerous hearings and

22
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:24,700
contributed studies and coordinated

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:27,429
letters try to facilitate empirical

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,399
evidence into the policy process and

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,680
it's part of our mission at the create

26
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:36,520
Center at the University of Glasgow that

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,259
we do that so that there's a place in

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,819
the world where empirical evidence

29
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,060
relating to copyright an information law

30
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,060
is

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,390
consolidated and presented in a way that

32
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,040
is useful and actionable it will see

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,899
today you know whether it helped or not

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,420
but before I do that I want to show you

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,430
just quickly the website because it may

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,130
be helpful for you in the future

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:07,409
if you want to keep track on what is

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:09,389
happening in the directive space so this

39
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,220
is one of the the letters we wrote

40
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:17,160
before the first plenary vote in the

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,290
European Parliament on the euro report

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,370
and where we try to counter some of the

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,010
the claims between fictional claims in

44
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:32,989
in the debate but on the website itself

45
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:35,579
there's much more so that's the page and

46
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,650
you have a time line so basically you

47
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,269
can follow the developments in the next

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,790
two years will be critical for the

49
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:44,130
implementation so why we have now an

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,700
adopted directive the way we will turn

51
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,970
out it in the implementation day is a a

52
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,640
wide range of possibilities so we've got

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,299
a time line you know which goes back a

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,298
couple of years

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,590
then we've got all the various drafts so

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,450
you can track back when the changes were

57
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,450
made and sometimes why

58
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,269
you can see where we broadly are in

59
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,660
implementation States stage than two

60
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,660
years ago

61
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:27,490
then we've got transcripts of plenary

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:29,800
debates oh it's not there okay so

63
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,960
[Music]

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,960
it should until we turn up there

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,890
it's not a it's not fatal okay so I told

66
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,819
you what you might see if you could go

67
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,799
there so don't worry but the most

68
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:57,589
interesting aspect of it is that it also

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:59,420
contains a lists catalogues of empirical

70
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,100
studies that matter to the various

71
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,988
provisions of the directive in

72
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,420
particular the three which have been at

73
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:08,239
the most contested ones so the the

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,149
publishers right which was 11 is now 15

75
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,459
and obviously the the change of the

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,459
liability regime for platforms which was

77
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:19,070
13 in is now 17 and then texts and data

78
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,600
mining we have also a catalogue of

79
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,950
empirical material and we will try to

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,389
complement and follow the implementation

81
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:31,389
stage okay so I go back to the

82
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,389
presentation

83
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,639
[Music]

84
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,159
so the process of copyright reform

85
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,599
started in 2014 at the beginning of the

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,690
current term of the Commission's that's

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,850
five years ago and at the beginning when

88
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,280
the commissioners are appointed they get

89
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,010
a so-called mission letter so there's a

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,650
letter in which the Commission president

91
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,490
tells the appointed commissioner what

92
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,370
their scope and their priorities are for

93
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,560
their term as a commissioner in the to

94
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,479
Commissioner we looking at here is on

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,699
one hand Andrus Ansip who is a vice

96
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,300
president for the digital single market

97
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:19,720
and intereting who was the digital

98
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,380
economy commissioner during the critical

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,229
time and who still has his hand on some

100
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,630
of the developments as we will see so

101
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,849
the instruction here that's very

102
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,580
important the instruction here is to

103
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,210
look at the copyright directive as a

104
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,710
digital single market initiative if you

105
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,200
look at copyright as a digital single

106
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,120
market you would assume it's about

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,070
harmonization you know differences

108
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,820
between countries and about cross-border

109
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:54,150
access so this is the key to - - to a

110
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,590
digital single market and then we have a

111
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,359
assume interventions we have to do with

112
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,580
European competitiveness and innovation

113
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,680
so they may have a place in a digital

114
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,200
single market as well and if you look at

115
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,990
the brief the commissioners we are given

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,380
you know they look probably quite

117
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,660
plausible in that context so the the

118
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,909
vice-president who under under whom who

119
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:19,660
oversees all work relating to the

120
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,030
digital single market for them the

121
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,680
copyright is mainly listed as as a part

122
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,919
of completing the digital single market

123
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,220
and then for for retina we've got

124
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,719
something a bit more specific so we want

125
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,610
the right regulatory environment to

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,970
foster investment in various businesses

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,430
and users at the center of the action

128
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,450
okay users are at the center of the

129
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,570
action

130
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:49,539
okay so five years later we end up from

131
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:54,730
the digital single market in a discourse

132
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:57,970
which is the life and death of media so

133
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,070
that's a huge jump in additive and in

134
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,750
justification many of you in berlin

135
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,670
ville may have seen this is about in

136
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,190
newspaper but this didn't come out of

137
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,320
nothing so the argument here is you know

138
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,540
unless we get a new exclusive right

139
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,700
which allows a certain amount of control

140
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:18,340
over the spreading of online news and

141
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,560
monetization of you use it there will be

142
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,229
no quality press and the means to do it

143
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,020
is create this kind of exclusive new

144
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,880
ancillary right and if we don't get that

145
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:34,060
you know journalists will no longer

146
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,630
report that's the story so how did this

147
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,480
happen

148
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,670
so part of my talk today is basically

149
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,160
evidencing the change of narrative over

150
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,800
these five years then I would like to

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,220
talk about the processes and the

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,310
personnel which we're actors in that

153
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,460
change and then I look to at the end on

154
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,870
the evidence of lobbying so you know who

155
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:00,760
actually paid for it who had access and

156
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,980
in conclusion I would like to offer some

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,020
thoughts on what follows from that for

158
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,560
policymaking that's the title of my talk

159
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,359
so you know it's copyright reform

160
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,180
possible after we considered the journey

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,080
we've taken here so if you came here to

162
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,820
expect a detailed talk of a law

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,820
professor explained to you the

164
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,680
implementation options about article 13

165
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,240
come zips seventeen you know we have to

166
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,150
do that in a different form I'm happy to

167
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,060
take questions on that I will allow

168
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:35,409
quite a lot it's time for that

169
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,210
okay so five years so the proposal was

170
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,630
to complete the digital single market

171
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:42,130
and do a ambitious copyright reform as

172
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,900
part of that there were three

173
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,939
regulations three directives you know

174
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,449
format pages of impact assessments and

175
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,060
this very long alleged process and the

176
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:58,810
copyright attorney here whose tweet I

177
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:00,729
cite is the for the Czech Republic the

178
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,530
copyright attorney only on the Council

179
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,810
of the European Union he is one of the

180
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,640
few people who communicates a little bit

181
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,920
about what's happening in the Council of

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,860
European Union and that's in policy

183
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,180
terms again very interesting because we

184
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,100
know what happens in the Parliament to a

185
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,750
certain degree we don't know the lobby

186
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,240
transparency but we can see the

187
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,560
documents and the debates we know a

188
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,940
little bit about what happens in the

189
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,609
Commission because we can do Freedom of

190
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,010
Information requests but we have no idea

191
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,520
what happens in the council okay so so

192
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:33,670
that is a real gap and in the European

193
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,770
process you may know that the Commission

194
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,030
has the the the only is the only

195
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,829
institution that's got the competence to

196
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,949
introduce legislation so they hold the

197
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:44,440
original pen that is the key and then

198
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,560
both the the countries and Parliament

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,210
have to adopt an agree a position which

200
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,160
is typically a modification of the

201
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,350
original proposal but it can't change

202
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,180
the shape so

203
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,600
let's look now at the change in

204
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,180
narrative over these five years and some

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,970
of the the kind of modes of

206
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,758
communication developed by various parts

207
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,190
of the stakeholder interests of the

208
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,810
corporate Lobby so you will recognize

209
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,389
immediately again the same image which

210
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,969
turned out not by accident

211
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:20,279
in a German national newspaper was also

212
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,980
in a fake newspaper which was

213
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:27,389
distributed to members of parliament so

214
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:31,110
this is a initiative by by 18 press

215
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:33,089
agencies who try to communicate to

216
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,120
members of parliament you know this is

217
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,279
that article 11 the press publishes

218
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,800
write is essential for them to continue

219
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,399
their activities and you know to

220
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,680
illustrate that they put together a

221
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,500
newspaper which had some of the you know

222
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,699
the the new the new narrative you know

223
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,880
it's not a digital single market

224
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:57,300
narrative is not a competitively and

225
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,839
that if it's a narrative about fake news

226
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,729
about democratic values so a completely

227
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,000
new way of speaking about an exclusive

228
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,000
right

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,250
so move to next so this is material of

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,350
the same kind so this is also

231
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,139
distributed to any piece to influence

232
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,360
them and and here the narrative is

233
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:20,149
European cultures and the contact and

234
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,610
the attack and you know we have the

235
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:23,810
American tech giants you know and we

236
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,550
need to protect ourselves from them

237
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:31,250
there's a condom which is delivered with

238
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:35,899
it and then adding to that in online

239
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,839
campaigns a there is then the native

240
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:42,170
changes that any opposition to to

241
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:46,279
directive including your academic voices

242
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,759
we who try to help become recast as

243
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:54,339
essentially financed by tech giants so

244
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,779
any opposition any disagreement with the

245
00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:00,850
provisions in the shape of the directive

246
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,829
is then cast in in terms of Google and

247
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:11,540
to a lesser extent extent Facebook

248
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:14,120
Amazon and Apple and a graph which has

249
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,309
been circulated quite widely is this one

250
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,620
here which tries to show that the the

251
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,430
online internet campaign say if your

252
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,100
internet dot-eu

253
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,180
essentially is a fake campaign so it's

254
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,309
not any real concerns there it's a

255
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:35,089
mobilized what force by by American

256
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:37,809
foundations and and tech giants we will

257
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,610
see later on that this was produced by a

258
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:43,759
outfit which itself is financed by the

259
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:46,579
lobby so it's a curious setting but it's

260
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,250
a very different narrative so we came

261
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:51,620
from from from a digital single market -

262
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,040
you know European democratic values to

263
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,709
European culture against appropriation

264
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,779
by tech giants - this story that any

265
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:03,008
opposition to the directive essentially

266
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:08,189
is financed in and from far away

267
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:16,529
controlled by anti European forces

268
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:19,459
so against this then was the more and

269
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:22,560
more active and I would say radicalized

270
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,619
online community so in Germany it was

271
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,449
the most radicalized people went on

272
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,089
demonstrations but we also have here and

273
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:32,939
that interestingly enough yulia radar

274
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,519
moved with this so so once see did the

275
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:39,509
basis for the for they for the shape of

276
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,339
the directive changed policy makers in

277
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,319
Brussels themselves felt the only way

278
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,889
they could get heard is playing the same

279
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:48,120
game

280
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:52,379
so it became essentially a a mutually

281
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,970
reinforcing game so so rather than

282
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,160
looking at what are they did the right

283
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,769
policy measures for the policy aims we

284
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,579
agree to when we started it becomes kind

285
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:06,560
of a gamesmanship you know who can come

286
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,560
up with a more vertical narrative and

287
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:13,980
that's again something I think we should

288
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:16,220
reflect on how policy is formed in this

289
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,319
area if this is the only way to get hurt

290
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,029
and if we look at the end now which

291
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,769
narrative has succeeded I think we can

292
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,300
be pretty honest about it

293
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,899
I think the successful narrative was

294
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,579
this one so this is the record industry

295
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,949
so if you look through these five points

296
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:37,680
I think this is what got us a directive

297
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:39,990
three we have now it's formulated in

298
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:45,689
moderate terms it appears to you know

299
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:51,930
rights range of values and it has little

300
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:55,949
to do with the start of the journey ok

301
00:14:51,930 --> 00:15:01,229
so now the next section of my talk the

302
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:03,269
look at really the alternatives to this

303
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,569
narrative and why we ended up in this

304
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:09,660
narrative so the end the end not if we

305
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:11,939
ended up with is you know American tech

306
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,240
giants against European culture and on

307
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:19,259
the other side assume we are now you

308
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,360
know a digital colony of France which

309
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,080
responds to corporate right hold

310
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,080
interests

311
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,430
in entrenched industries so not if she

312
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,170
has a selection of other narratives

313
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,260
under which you know this debate could

314
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,479
have been conducted the first one you

315
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,459
know it's probably goes back to how a

316
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,860
corporate policy was formed so I'm not

317
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:44,099
sure it's the best guide you know if

318
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,680
it's a matter of public interest now it

319
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,800
should not just be a question of

320
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,959
doctrinal law and and but we need the

321
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,760
expertise here we did need to understand

322
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,189
you know how property rights and how

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,410
access to information how freedom of the

324
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,980
Arts how these fundamental rights are

325
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,890
you know traded off or if if they can be

326
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,680
we need you know some coherence in the

327
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:12,750
in liability principles and the you know

328
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:16,109
is the stuff of of many a system of law

329
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,980
is to have agreements on due process and

330
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,589
and contestability so I wouldn't dismiss

331
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,740
the legal discourse but I can see this

332
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:29,070
is a difficult one to to carry you know

333
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,500
an issue of this gravity the second one

334
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,390
is a social narrative about the changing

335
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,000
role of the user user and we had that in

336
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,040
the initial you know brief for the so

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,980
it's a a digital user it's not the same

338
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,459
as we had you know a user conceived in

339
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,730
in law you know three decades ago it's

340
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:52,589
not a passive kind of vessel we don't

341
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:56,760
consume so it's yeah we we live in a

342
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:59,070
networked setting and copyright law has

343
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,110
never accepted this so this would have

344
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,919
been again a discourse which we could

345
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:08,220
have used to persuade policy to form in

346
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,079
a different way third one cultural again

347
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,750
if we look at the the initial briefs

348
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,990
they they also had quite a lot on

349
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,780
cultural heritage and and online

350
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,250
education out of commerce so there was

351
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,780
an attempt to address a cultural

352
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,790
dimension and there's still quite a lot

353
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,859
of good stuff in that area in the final

354
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,599
directive but it was not the prominent

355
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,850
discourse under which the directive was

356
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,830
negotiated and what I call it the black

357
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,870
hole again many in the audience will be

358
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,919
very familiar with that term because the

359
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,350
copyright term is life Plus 70 years

360
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,470
we get this kind of very strange shape

361
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,320
that the Burks which are available for

362
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,270
you to consume legally either being

363
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,340
released fairly recently or out of

364
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:52,510
copyright and then we've got this whole

365
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,250
area in between when works are not

366
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,110
available for use but they're also not

367
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,030
on the market so they're still protected

368
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,870
by copyright law but but you know you

369
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:06,070
can't repurpose them and then the final

370
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:08,530
discourse again I think which you would

371
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,120
expect to be prominently surfacing in

372
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,280
this in this discussion would be a

373
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,199
standard economic discourse about

374
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,060
innovations about market entry about

375
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,980
incentives and here we've got the

376
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,440
curious situation that you know the

377
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,840
digital world is doing fine so there's

378
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,360
more stuff out there than ever before so

379
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,610
for for a standard economists you know

380
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,320
the copyright is sent if needs to be

381
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,270
treated in a very different way than it

382
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,100
has been in the past so again I think

383
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,170
this would have been a useful way of

384
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:41,590
framing its course none of this has

385
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:45,910
happened so why okay so when the

386
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,740
directive was published in 2016 this was

387
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:51,430
the slide the European Commission put

388
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,820
out on their press release so this sets

389
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:58,870
out you know in a their most persuasive

390
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:01,090
way the the policy aims of what they

391
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,979
tried to achieve in the directive so

392
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,720
better choice access to content online

393
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,610
across borders so that's very much

394
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,160
digital single market so it's against

395
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,300
geo blocking and you know has been met

396
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,760
in some ways with the portability

397
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:17,050
regulation and the the subtle of two

398
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,600
directive regulation but in fairly you

399
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,800
know modest terms then we've got you

400
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,149
know improved copyright rules for

401
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,879
education research cultural heritage

402
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,820
inclusion of disabled people quite a lot

403
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,890
of this found its way into the directive

404
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,750
and then we've got you know the favored

405
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,150
online environmental creators in the

406
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,640
press and you know nobody can disagree

407
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:41,620
with this you know we all want to work

408
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,780
and invest in a fair environment but

409
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,300
what does it mean is you know it wasn't

410
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,480
there in the initial brief so what does

411
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:53,010
it mean and well

412
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:57,600
it turned out to mean I jump quickly

413
00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:00,660
forward it turned out to mean a Indust

414
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,000
in industrial policy measure essentially

415
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:06,030
what what hides behind the fair

416
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,190
marketplace is the idea that there are

417
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,030
certain European sectors of Industry

418
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:17,460
which need the help of additional rights

419
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:19,230
and rules and this was driven by Ithaca

420
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,830
that shows you how important it is that

421
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,710
you know whoever holds the the pen in

422
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:28,590
the first draft controls where we end up

423
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,750
so from the digital market narrative

424
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:35,340
ended up in a narrative of industrial

425
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:40,080
policy at least for for this bunch of

426
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,178
rules so if we look at this you know it

427
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,070
looks pretty innocent

428
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,990
it looks also something most societies

429
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:52,168
would be happy to invest policy in and

430
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:56,700
so unsurprisingly it's also not that far

431
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:59,040
away from the radar report of 2014-15 so

432
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,770
this was a report with which reviewed

433
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,809
the infrastop directive so before this

434
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,070
directive the last important horizontal

435
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,490
measure in the European Union was

436
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,320
infrastructure active of 2001 which

437
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,650
implemented the bipod treatise and also

438
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,740
kind of to certainly extend harmonized

439
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:19,620
exceptions at least the ones that are

440
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,510
possible and so what you narrator

441
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,580
suggested in her report which was more

442
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,410
accepted in a modified form in in the

443
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,360
European Parliament was we that we need

444
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:32,520
a rebalancing of the copyright space

445
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:35,850
with a greater focus on users and with a

446
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:43,520
greater focus on one we use and you know

447
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:46,080
a rebalancing of the underlying deal so

448
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,020
from the radar report to the directive

449
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,460
so the big change is the one which I

450
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,559
indicated just a minute ago the big

451
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,380
change is this addition of industrial

452
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,840
policies supporting particular sectors

453
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,540
and the two provisions you know most of

454
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,189
you in the room will will know the the

455
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,490
which have been the most controversial

456
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,960
there

457
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,550
others in there but the focus of the

458
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,260
public debate mostly has been on these

459
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,149
two it's it's the new exclusive rights

460
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:13,610
for best practices and it's the change

461
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,610
in liability regime for platforms

462
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,209
so I speed up a little bit so this will

463
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,879
go in more details the next three slides

464
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,669
to what the European Commission said

465
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,769
they would do to achieve those aims and

466
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:35,480
I don't think I've time to talk you

467
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:37,789
through this in detail I just stick with

468
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,720
it the third one how did they want to do

469
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:44,179
their Industrial Policy how would they

470
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:49,029
you know use intellectual property

471
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:52,990
rights to protect or incentivize or

472
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:54,470
shape certain cultural sectors in the

473
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,330
European Union

474
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,919
well they say here the new rules

475
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,779
proposed by the Commission reinforce the

476
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,600
position of right holders to negotiate

477
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:06,679
remuneration for their creative content

478
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:10,269
so we have we introduced new rules which

479
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:13,309
improve the bargaining of right holders

480
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:16,159
it doesn't quite say you know how this

481
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,860
will happen or who against but this is

482
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,830
really the the underlying motivation so

483
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,779
industrial policy here it is designed to

484
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,780
improve the the bargaining of right

485
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,230
holders

486
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,129
[Music]

487
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:37,039
so apart from petting uh who drove this

488
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:38,990
agenda he famously encouraged also the

489
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,059
you know the if I told us themselves

490
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,659
then to control the public debate about

491
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:46,190
this point so which is arranging again

492
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:48,130
for for the change from the narrative

493
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,769
and the way the directive has

494
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:54,860
communicated the traditional political

495
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:57,409
class still consumes content and news

496
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,779
through traditional media and the

497
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:04,130
traditional media where a had a stake

498
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:07,279
here so so because of that the reporting

499
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:11,659
on the directive was either not existent

500
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,639
or often biased and in this famous

501
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,529
intervention in 2006 I think I basically

502
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,969
told the publishers you know if you want

503
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,580
this right you have to tell your online

504
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,610
journalists who shut up

505
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,080
and again if you want to change the way

506
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:28,668
policies make you know this is a

507
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:33,949
problematic intervention so the second

508
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:36,470
big player is under Andrus Ansip so he

509
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,559
in the beginning really stuck to his

510
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,899
digital single markets brief so that you

511
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,029
know do you blocking not being able to

512
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:47,719
access content across borders is one of

513
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:50,149
the big issues and also he talked up the

514
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,490
the the economic and cultural value of

515
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:55,010
digital heritage museums libraries film

516
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:58,370
archives and he made strong statements

517
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:01,610
that hyperlinking would be protected so

518
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:05,090
he stuck in his rhetoric very much to

519
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:07,580
the original brief but as we moved

520
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,320
through the elective process and that's

521
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,000
again typical for European policymaking

522
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,519
it's better to have something than

523
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,730
nothing so you're not seen as a success

524
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,190
if your proposed legislation doesn't get

525
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,649
through the process so towards you know

526
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:26,750
towards the end and see more and more

527
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:30,409
became really a force in in pushing the

528
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,870
the directive forward

529
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,410
and then we have got the situation in

530
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,409
the European Parliament

531
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,540
so in European Parliament we had a

532
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,730
change of report areas of the reporter

533
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,620
is very important the reporter is

534
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,870
basically the negotiation position

535
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:54,909
between the Parliament and the other

536
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:57,560
European positions so again he's

537
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,900
effectively the the person who holds the

538
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,340
pen for the Parliament I indicated how

539
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,140
important is for the Commission who

540
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,350
holds the pen for the Parliament the pen

541
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:10,250
is held by the reporter and there was a

542
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:15,110
change in reporter - from from today's

543
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,370
comedy Katya was a Maltese MEP from the

544
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,189
same party also from the Christian

545
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:22,310
Democrats center-right and there was a

546
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,590
change - axel Foss and that's a that

547
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:28,250
changed completely the way the directive

548
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:31,459
was handled so in the draft which comedy

549
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:33,050
Katya prepared the the exclusive rights

550
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,060
for passport wishes where had

551
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:39,710
disappeared and the filtering obligation

552
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,810
had been qualified so we had a

553
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,290
completely different situation until

554
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:47,000
first came in and through Freedom of

555
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:50,120
Information requests we know that at

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,010
that particular stage there were was a

557
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,090
meeting between the chief executive of

558
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,710
Axel Springer hurting her and force

559
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,949
which is a quite an unusual situation

560
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:04,130
for for policy of this type that you

561
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,950
bring essentially you know people are on

562
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:09,770
different sides of it in one setting and

563
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:11,720
what we've seen afterwards really shows

564
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,720
the out that the Industrial Policy took

565
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,710
precedence from then on this was what

566
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,620
had to be in the directive and then on

567
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,530
the outside we have you narrator appear

568
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:29,020
who was the shadow operative in the URI

569
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:33,139
committee which is a formal role and

570
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:35,810
Catherine's dealer Scottish labour MEP

571
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:40,280
who is the chair was the vice chair of

572
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:42,260
the internal market committee and for

573
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,670
for article 13 they had joined

574
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,920
competence with the legal affairs

575
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,230
committee so in in some ways she was on

576
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,910
the same footing is force for for

577
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,670
article

578
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,460
thirteen who became 17 and that was an

579
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,850
important factor in the devote it last

580
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,340
July even first the the mandate was

581
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:08,149
refused to first to go ahead with his

582
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:09,139
draft okay so that concludes the second

583
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,670
phase of my talk

584
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,080
so we've now looked a little bit at

585
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,850
European processes and the kind of

586
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,600
people who have driven the adoption of

587
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,790
the directive so in the next section I

588
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,060
want to look at what we actually know

589
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:26,090
about how lobbying has taken place and

590
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,250
how it's been shaped and I will I in

591
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,409
this very heavily on a report written by

592
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,290
corporate Europe which is a campaign

593
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,550
organization which is funded by

594
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:40,210
donations and twelve foundations and

595
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:43,450
normally focus on finance and

596
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,820
agriculture and food and trade issues

597
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:50,000
and they also write you know other

598
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:54,050
reports on where the influence of Lobby

599
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,240
on legislation needs investigation so

600
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:00,740
they wrote a report last December on on

601
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,140
the copyright directive and it's

602
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,930
insightful and I recommend you to read

603
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,210
it so essentially I start at the top

604
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,830
here with the conclusion this Lobby

605
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,690
battle over copyright this one key

606
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,669
example of how aggressive lobbying by

607
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,290
competing industries open crowd out

608
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,870
other voices and successfully

609
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,510
successfully distorts the public debate

610
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,850
so we have seen already that the the

611
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:25,220
discourse moved that this cause moved

612
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:29,290
from initials in a market to you know

613
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,810
tech giants against European culture

614
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:35,680
what corporate Europe suggests is

615
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:38,600
essentially what we have now is really a

616
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,490
competing Lobby battle between two

617
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,070
different corporate interests on the one

618
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,810
hand we have nearly back-catalogue right

619
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,740
holders mostly music industry in the

620
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:51,409
publishers and on the other side we have

621
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,960
you know the the tech companies and they

622
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:57,380
are both you know legitimate corporate

623
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,870
interests and by structuring the the

624
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,120
the policy and the lobby as a

625
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:05,060
competition between these groups the

626
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,669
other voices are being drained out okay

627
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:10,510
so so we no longer here you know from

628
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:15,080
from from users we don't hear from

629
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:16,910
startups we don't hear from smaller

630
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,790
companies we don't hear from independent

631
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:23,380
artists it's all wrapped up in in a

632
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,379
binary structure

633
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:32,879
and they reviewed a number of Freedom of

634
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,580
Information requests to the Commission

635
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,760
and also interviewed members of

636
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,669
parliament and also accessed information

637
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,850
through a number of different ways and

638
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:46,980
what I show you here is basically the

639
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,399
result of Freedom of Information request

640
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:53,550
to the European Commission on meetings

641
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,280
they held with lobbyists which dealt

642
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:59,669
with copyright and the results are

643
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,590
really striking for anybody who is

644
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,030
spending in the copyright world for for

645
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,959
a while this is you know it's no

646
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,899
surprise at all is that's how it is so

647
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,790
the top is you know the record industry

648
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,830
then we get the publishers and then we

649
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:17,340
get the you know the trade body of the

650
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,320
of the collective societies and that's

651
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,810
you know that's how copyright policy has

652
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,899
been made for for the best part of the

653
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,899
last century but

654
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,940
interesting in the context of how our

655
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,539
narrative has evolved the narrative that

656
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,429
essentially policy is controlled by

657
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:41,700
American tech giants this is a different

658
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:44,960
story so Google is the most prominent of

659
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,269
the of the tech giants here 22 meetings

660
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,179
then the next on this side of the

661
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:54,000
corporate battle is a Trade Organization

662
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:58,679
digital Europe which comes in with a

663
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,710
mayor 11 or 12 meetings so if you

664
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,779
consider the dead lobby environment how

665
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:09,120
influence is being exercised on the Penn

666
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:11,789
who writes the directive this suggests

667
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,000
that what we have received is very much

668
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:17,129
a draft which reflects the corporate

669
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,559
lobby of the content industry and not

670
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:26,159
tech giants and even more disturbing are

671
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:30,059
the next to you so if you add up the

672
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,510
interventions the most important or the

673
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,639
most wealthy let's say the the

674
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,340
institution's for the best access to the

675
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,408
Commission are music collecting

676
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,840
societies so we're not talking about you

677
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:45,990
know copyright covers games it covers

678
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,059
films it covers you know software music

679
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,880
is an important sector but it's not even

680
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:54,029
the biggest nor the most important in

681
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,049
most countries but in copyright policy

682
00:32:54,029 --> 00:33:00,539
it drives what we receive okay society

683
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:03,720
is shaped by the interest of one

684
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,429
particular sector and here we've got you

685
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,039
know the collective site is added up

686
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:10,470
from from southern France pas UK and

687
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:12,720
email for Germany so these are the three

688
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,940
biggest ones in Europe and we have

689
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,860
obviously the umbrella body body for

690
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,159
them and if you add up their meetings

691
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:23,840
they've had meetings 54 or something

692
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,210
like that so if you just look at the

693
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,959
amount of engagement and access they are

694
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:35,940
at the top so and these are the

695
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,280
consumers okay so that's you know

696
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,190
users which we are supposed to be at the

697
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,160
center of of the way copyright reform

698
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,980
should have been addressed and it's a

699
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,140
it's a it's a Porsche or it's a Porsche

700
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,429
it's man one organization which is the

701
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:59,850
European consumer Association among the

702
00:33:53,429 --> 00:34:01,710
first 36 so now we've looked at the

703
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:05,969
evidence on lobbying let's look at the

704
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:10,199
evidence on the evidence so what do we

705
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:11,879
actually know about the empirical basis

706
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:16,230
for copyright policy and copyright

707
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:18,210
reform so if you look at the material we

708
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,730
supply it into the the policy process

709
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,440
there is really a consensus at least on

710
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,500
the article 11 inand take an article 13

711
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,929
what the the studies have produced about

712
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,530
past implementations of the part of the

713
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:36,480
publishers right and what we know about

714
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,700
the function of the notice and takedowns

715
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,800
is the system there is a lot of

716
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,029
empirical material now off of the

717
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,609
highest quality which is available

718
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,000
policymaking and it you know the

719
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:48,389
research centers my colleagues and I are

720
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,879
pretty clear

721
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,710
you know what the directive is doing

722
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,750
particularly on the industrial policy

723
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:59,760
side is entirely misguided and so the

724
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,830
evidence says that copyright remains out

725
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,230
of balance and what I told you about the

726
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,580
lobby makes this unsurprising we still

727
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,380
have this black hole there's some

728
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,690
measures in the dark if it makes it a

729
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,790
little bit better we have overall every

730
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,350
distribution in the copyright system

731
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,390
from the living to the debt which cannot

732
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:17,759
be weigh in you know the aim of

733
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,920
copyright law from the limited that

734
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,180
means you know that because you've got

735
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:28,680
life plus 70 and the estates and you

736
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:32,339
know the best known works tend to be the

737
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,169
most valuable ones it any extension of

738
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,910
copyright term leads you know further to

739
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,790
a redistribution of money from from from

740
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:42,470
from living people to essentially dead

741
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:44,970
people the empirical evidence is there

742
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,950
the the role of the digital user is

743
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,410
misunderstood so there's a lot of

744
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:53,730
studies from sociology from communicate

745
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:55,470
science about the changing use all this

746
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,120
you know speaks very clearly that the

747
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,910
current balance of copyright law is not

748
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,040
right and on the two most controversial

749
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,170
provisions the evidence is also very

750
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,790
clear you know there's no no indication

751
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,380
whatsoever that the post post new right

752
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,870
will produce the positive results it's

753
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,000
supposed to do it will you know it's

754
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,819
very unlikely that money ends up with

755
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,530
journalists is very unlikely that the

756
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,760
amount of money which are being raised

757
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:23,670
will transform the fate of the quality

758
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,410
tress the press the most likely effect

759
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,170
is that entry into the market becomes

760
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,819
more difficult and on platform

761
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,990
regulation the picture is much more

762
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,270
complex

763
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,759
so platforms need to be regulated and

764
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,320
one of the difficult questions is how to

765
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,620
distinguish what is needed in the

766
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,540
copyright space with all meshes in other

767
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,540
spaces whether it's fake news or whether

768
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,040
it's terrorism or security or

769
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:50,970
pornography there there's a whole range

770
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,610
of other conceptual frames and in the

771
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,500
law struggles to to offer a coherent

772
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:57,300
kind of view what liability of platforms

773
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,950
should like you look like and how we

774
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:06,180
deal with you know essentially a

775
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:08,910
dominant market situation and which

776
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,680
competition law can't quite work out how

777
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:15,509
it deals with vertical integration and

778
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,919
and acquisitions so on platform

779
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:20,610
aggregation the the empirical evidence

780
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,640
is is not as clear but it is quite clear

781
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:25,440
that that we know now for for over ten

782
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,140
years how it notice and takedown

783
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:34,730
functions we have through experimental

784
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:37,890
tests and also through the review of

785
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:40,470
databases the lumen database and also

786
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,150
the Google transparency reports we have

787
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,120
a much better understanding how the

788
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,880
notice takedown system works and Yahoo

789
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,170
falls out who who and what are the

790
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,310
effects for the kind of content we

791
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:55,560
assume so the the empirical evidence

792
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,210
seems to suggest we need a better notice

793
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,490
intact our own system we don't really

794
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:02,710
need a inversion of the liability and

795
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,419
the way the the directive is framed

796
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,400
the key decisions on how this will work

797
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,770
out are really in implementation stage

798
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,010
and we can discuss that in question

799
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:16,060
answers if there is an interest so to

800
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:20,580
conclude the talk so when the directive

801
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:23,620
was finally finally adopted this was the

802
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:28,870
treat which came out of your glute

803
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:30,130
Yonkers office so the dish of the single

804
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,190
market is finally being completed

805
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,980
completed because we've now got the

806
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:39,010
copyright directive clear rules will

807
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:41,070
current county fair remuneration for

808
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,990
creators strong rights for users and

809
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,760
responsibility for platforms well what

810
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:51,729
you heard for me doesn't suggest that

811
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:53,440
the case in the adoption of the

812
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,510
directive in the Council of European

813
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,730
Union there was a dissent which doesn't

814
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,770
happen very often so there was a

815
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,050
statement issued by the Netherlands

816
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:05,170
Luxemburg Poland Italy in Finland and

817
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:07,300
it's worth reading it's worth reading it

818
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,790
more or less you know sums up what I

819
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:14,650
just explained to you you know how we

820
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:18,120
ended up in a situation which is in many

821
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:23,310
ways against the purposes of the policy

822
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:29,470
that was started in 2014

823
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:31,660
okay so I think I conclude my talk with

824
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:36,600
allowing you to reflect on what you see

825
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:46,290
rather than read it to you thank you

826
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:49,429
[Applause]

827
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,429
[Music]

828
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:58,430
okay this is quite something to digest I

829
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:02,190
think Thank You Martin questions remarks

830
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:06,140
music industry lobbyists can contradict

831
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:09,990
now whether you know okay now

832
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:13,049
hello I'm not a lobbyist can I ask you a

833
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,029
question about article 14 which concerns

834
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:18,120
visual works of art in the public domain

835
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:21,450
in the German context how do you see

836
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:25,190
that being implemented we're here the

837
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,509
restrictions quite tight and

838
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,330
organizations have been able to maintain

839
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,480
control for enumeration and other

840
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:35,370
purposes and how do you see the future

841
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,800
well I mean that was a late addition and

842
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:44,400
in this in somebody's of a surprise that

843
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:52,860
we managed to get it in so so saying we

844
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:55,980
the I would say the so those group who

845
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,290
took seriously the initial aim of the of

846
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,180
the directive putting users at the

847
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:06,450
center and also releasing the potential

848
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:08,370
of culture so if we look here I don't

849
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:09,859
have much about it just that works

850
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,080
official out in the public domain

851
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:16,050
indeed see the idea here is that by

852
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,299
digitizing you can't assert another new

853
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:22,590
layer of rights about on out of

854
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,270
copyright material and that's again I

855
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,800
think an example where you know if this

856
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,390
is a harmonization measure you would

857
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,460
have to treat this in the same way in

858
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,839
all countries of European Union and many

859
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,550
countries have different layers on

860
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,460
rights relating to photography as well

861
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,410
and then there's a separate layer of

862
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,090
rights for example Italy relating which

863
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,609
give a sweet generous protection to

864
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,410
culture works so it's very enough making

865
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,940
that statement but you know how it ends

866
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,940
up in practice is

867
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,440
I still think it's a good thing to have

868
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:54,000
it there as an S name but III would not

869
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,680
be able to predict you know in the

870
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,430
German context how the implantation

871
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,020
which would mean you can't just take the

872
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,419
the right provided in German law for

873
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,859
photographs away you know because it's a

874
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,830
different type of right it's not covered

875
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:12,029
by directive so so the problem

876
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:13,830
yeah and the question away hi I'm I

877
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:18,000
actually have two questions regarding

878
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:21,180
article 15 or before article 11 and they

879
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,250
are kind of connected so there was a

880
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,330
conspiracy saying that the real reason

881
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:30,869
for article 11 is to shut down the small

882
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:33,180
newspaper pages or by shutting down

883
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:35,369
Google News completely so that the

884
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,330
people the users have to visit the large

885
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:42,090
corporate news websites not through

886
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,970
Google but directly and so they can have

887
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:48,570
a much more market share regards of

888
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:51,149
advertisement is there any evidence that

889
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:54,390
this could be the real reason and the

890
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:57,119
second question is which is connected is

891
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:59,790
there a legal instrument that can

892
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:06,330
actually force Google to shut down

893
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:09,840
Google News if they say reduce the the

894
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:13,380
news station on Google News to the legal

895
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:17,810
free minimum which is in my opinion just

896
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:23,690
the headline with a link with no image

897
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:25,820
okay so I don't subscribe to conspiracy

898
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,770
theories and as you can see if you

899
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,690
empirically take you know you most of

900
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,180
the time you there's evidence there you

901
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:35,630
know just look for it it may be hard to

902
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,759
get it out but the I agree that the

903
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,280
publishers right is a puzzle you know I

904
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,020
have not mean III wrote a study with

905
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,090
line Bentley for European Parliament on

906
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,100
it and we reviewed the evidence on the

907
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:49,250
on the implementation in Spain and in in

908
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:53,930
in Germany and it is very hard to work

909
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:56,330
out by the why it is there why yeah what

910
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,790
would this new layer of exclusive rights

911
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,110
what would it really produce we know

912
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:05,380
that and German context it has

913
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:05,380
introduced much you know very little and

914
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:11,660
still you know it's become kind of a

915
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,660
article of faith and it's very hard to

916
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,220
work out what you know it can't be the

917
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,080
direct financial benefits is very

918
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,029
unlikely and in particular in the

919
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,340
version we have now which you know the

920
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,500
version now still permits hyper linking

921
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,990
it still commits individual words it

922
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,250
still admits it's short extracts and

923
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,470
then we've got the Berne Convention

924
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,750
which check out article 10 which permits

925
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,879
quotation so you know so there's the

926
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,290
argument here okay this is an ancillary

927
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,870
right that's foreign bank invention but

928
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,009
still the desde it seems very very

929
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,589
strange that the Berne Convention

930
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:45,350
specifically you know speaks about press

931
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:47,240
summaries it's their press summaries are

932
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:48,650
permitted you must permit press

933
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,500
summaries if your member state of the

934
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:55,340
European you know of the of the Berne

935
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,570
Convention so so this tension has been

936
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,820
weakened side by the courts at some

937
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,500
point yeah we need to know whether you

938
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:04,040
can just have two different laws there

939
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:07,340
yeah we have to understand whether what

940
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,150
is a short extract so I would expect you

941
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,800
know that as some kind of meaningful

942
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:15,230
aggregation services is still possible

943
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,200
it's still possible on the on the text

944
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:19,550
we have in front of you but much will

945
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,140
depend on how it's done cited in

946
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:25,460
international law what the role of

947
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:28,310
collecting societies is and I think it

948
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,589
may be true that for spring spring eyes

949
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:34,680
is very well positioned for this so

950
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:37,890
it's and it could be that fish but now

951
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,710
it is a benefit they are to to control

952
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,920
one who else comes into the market

953
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:46,140
possible and you know the evidence I

954
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,390
only the only evidence I presented you

955
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,029
in the men events which is there is that

956
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,489
Springer was a key policy player in in

957
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:55,729
this so you know we should ask Springer

958
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:58,469
why they ever have it why they have it

959
00:45:55,729 --> 00:46:01,669
okay so the second question we might be

960
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:01,670
briefly was

961
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,940
okay yeah answer that I'll answer that

962
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,940
that's fine

963
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,740
Dominique my name I used to be the data

964
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:16,380
analyst and she 4dg comm and later for

965
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:19,500
EPP group so I can assure you that the

966
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,800
whole online rate of of how this toka

967
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,660
turn was definitely flag to the

968
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,060
Commissioner and except us

969
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,430
and they were very surprised about what

970
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,410
happened online but I have to flag that

971
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,299
you are ADA axial force and günther

972
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,430
Oettinger all German speaker so the

973
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,430
whole discussion about this is complete

974
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:42,240
different in other countries and I think

975
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:44,250
we will see what inter inter acting as

976
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,890
underlining intention was when he

977
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,590
actually leaves office in what position

978
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:52,319
he will assume afterwards because I

979
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,210
think he will go private industry so

980
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,950
that would be a lot more exciting to

981
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:58,460
follow and and we see what happens so

982
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:00,600
it's more statement than a question

983
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,230
thank you anyway

984
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:08,160
more questions I see one question over

985
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:10,170
here so maybe a follow-up to your answer

986
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,339
about about Bern and whether or not this

987
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,220
is compatible with Bern

988
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,560
there's been some talk that maybe this

989
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,959
isn't compatible with Sita and and maybe

990
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,790
not compatible with the e-commerce

991
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,710
directive because it imposes general

992
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,330
monitoring duty do you think that people

993
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,960
are just grasping at straws or will

994
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:29,640
these be viable challenges I think it's

995
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,500
part of the mix of uncertainty I mean

996
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,330
that's clearly there's some tensions you

997
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,010
know that this the Canadian free trade

998
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,720
agreement with the European Union has

999
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,210
has mentioned specifically the

1000
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,759
e-commerce directive you know and so to

1001
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:49,020
the integrity of it in somebody needs to

1002
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:52,980
be preserved and so

1003
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:55,470
that's I don't see these as stumbling

1004
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,420
blocks I think I see them as sand in the

1005
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:02,879
grain which will feed into the

1006
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:08,040
implementation III would say so so if we

1007
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,080
look at the implementation phase and we

1008
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,560
talked a little bit beforehand so what

1009
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,200
what will happen now it will that day

1010
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,210
because we can't have you know 27 or 28

1011
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,009
different regimes within European Union

1012
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,290
they have to come up with a regime in

1013
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:23,790
which this switch in liability is

1014
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,130
translated in something that can be

1015
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:29,250
processed and so that the most tricky

1016
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:30,630
question at the start is so so yes we

1017
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:34,110
have an obligation that we now have to

1018
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:36,270
license okay so that's so we know now if

1019
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,490
I start a platform you know within three

1020
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:41,220
years and once I reach 10 million years

1021
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:44,310
turnover I have to license the stuff

1022
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,740
which uses upload so do I need to

1023
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,150
license everything everybody uploads you

1024
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:51,359
know this could be anything from from

1025
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:56,400
from a game to software to you know to a

1026
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:59,550
clip of text so so that the first

1027
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,359
question is who do I go to okay so so

1028
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:05,660
who do I get a license for from most of

1029
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:09,509
in many cases there will not be a ready

1030
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:11,220
body or license holder I can ask it's in

1031
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,460
music no problem you know a music I know

1032
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:16,980
where to ask because they are organized

1033
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,470
but in most of the interesting in those

1034
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:23,250
internet innovations you know it's it's

1035
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:25,290
more more difficult so so then I can't

1036
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,330
track them down or I don't get the

1037
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:31,200
license on the right terms so then the

1038
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:33,420
next step is I have to then if I then

1039
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,950
don't want to be liable I have to go

1040
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,850
through three steps so I have to

1041
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:41,910
exercise best efforts firstly to locate

1042
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,950
I have to evidence that I try it and and

1043
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,960
then I have to respond to take down

1044
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:47,399
essentially so if I get the notice I

1045
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,100
have to do what I had to do under the

1046
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,920
e-commerce directive I have to take it

1047
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,839
down and if it's applied in the right

1048
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,850
form I have to prevent it from going

1049
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,830
back up but that means that information

1050
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,839
has to be supplied in a consistent form

1051
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:04,140
so we need the database of stuff

1052
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:06,660
which you know then you know feeds the

1053
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,740
filter and that's when you know the the

1054
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:13,049
freedom of expression and meme and

1055
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,330
discussion really kicks in so so how the

1056
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:17,580
licensing regime will evolve at the

1057
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,020
national level is completely unclear it

1058
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:23,970
could go in in very very different

1059
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:26,820
different ways so I think to kind of

1060
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,220
legal kind of problems you you you you

1061
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:32,100
you stated I think they are they're real

1062
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,339
ones and and how you know general

1063
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:38,009
monotone obligation can't be imposed it

1064
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:41,670
says in the directive and also it says

1065
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:44,070
in the e-commerce directive so so it has

1066
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,530
to be a specific monitoring the specific

1067
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:49,080
monitoring linked to these databases of

1068
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,210
rights apply it so the shape of these

1069
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,490
databases is absolutely key of an to

1070
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:55,530
answering it so putting this point in

1071
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,270
you know may shape the National

1072
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,860
implementation in a particular way but

1073
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,230
how do you shape it at European level I

1074
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,240
mean we can't have you know 27 different

1075
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,770
kind of takedown regimes laydowns

1076
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,080
regimes filtering regimes you know

1077
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:10,170
licensing arrangements it's it's not

1078
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:16,200
digital signal market I think you can

1079
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:19,620
allow one more question come on guys one

1080
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,799
one more answer is provided if you want

1081
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,799
to

1082
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:27,900
okay otherwise thank you so much Martin

1083
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,480
for this really deep inside
