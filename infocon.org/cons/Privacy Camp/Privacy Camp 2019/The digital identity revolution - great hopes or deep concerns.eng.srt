00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,510
us as well a couple of quick

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,029
housekeeping remarks or reminders we

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,559
have a bookshelf set up in the viaduct

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,330
the long read which is what this

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,580
república is about so if you have books

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,070
at home that you would like to share or

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,050
you would like to go browse for a new

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,500
book to take home and read the viaduct

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,809
is the place to go and of course we also

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,089
have our Moby Dick reading which is

18
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,769
going on throughout república and you're

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,149
welcome to join the ideas for you to

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,370
read a section from Moby Dick and

21
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,140
whenever a person makes a mistake the

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,429
next person continues reading and I

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,460
think a lot of people had fun doing that

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,440
so be sure to check out those two model

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,759
related things anyhow my name is

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,770
Geraldine de Bastian and I'm part of the

27
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,390
Republic a program team and it's my

28
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,399
honor not just to open the stage this

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,110
morning but also to moderate the

30
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,840
upcoming panel with a title or the

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,050
digital identity revolution grape hopes

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,060
or deep concerns now identity is a

33
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,530
concept that the majority of us here in

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,780
the West or in so-called developed

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,640
countries take for granted but according

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,500
to the World Bank 15% of the world

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,679
population more than 1 billion people

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,560
lack a valid form of identification a

39
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:42,140
figure not even accounting for the 60

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,989
million displaced 21 million refugees or

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,759
10 million stateless persons so with the

42
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:48,860
rise of different digital identities the

43
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,080
solutions new ethical questions are

44
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,300
rising as well and different

45
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,610
possibilities and those are what we'd

46
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,739
like to talk about today those ethical

47
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,179
questions around identity around self

48
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,789
sovereign identity and different

49
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,729
technologies in use and the concerns

50
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,319
around them I would like to first of all

51
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,690

63
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,500
good morning everyone very early hour

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,390
this this morning but on behalf of the

65
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,670
German Federal Ministry for development

66
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,549
cooperation and the gaz which is our

67
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,440
implementing agency which implements our

68
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,990
projects all over the world and all the

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,810
different partner countries we have at

70
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,870
warm welcome I'm a bit blinded by the

71
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,420
light but I hope we can still interact

72
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,450
with the audience later on even if it's

73
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,940
hard to see you thank you very much for

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,339
joining us this morning as this

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,130
generally has already said we all take

76
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,840
identity for granted we all think we

77
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,240
don't even think about this anymore

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,120
we all wouldn't be here if we hadn't

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,390
been able to register with república

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,400
this morning we all had to take out some

81
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,410
form of identity card this morning to

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,360
register here to actually get entrance

83
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,750
but as geraldine said already in her

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,120
including remarks 1 billion people in

85
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,090
this world do not have any form of

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,430
identification they can produce this

87
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,480
particularly relevant to contexts of

88
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:52,330
migration of flight of refugees and a

89
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,549
lot of them then in especially in

90
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,770
refugee camp camps can't find a

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,670
satisfiable answer to the question of

92
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,740
who are you I mean we often regard the

93
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,690
question Who am I as sort of you know a

94
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,760
metaphysical question but fill a lot of

95
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,970
people it is actually a very factual

96
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,340
matter the question and Who am I in

97
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,570
terms of how can I identify myself and

98
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:21,519
how can I lead a life that is based on

99
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:24,610
some form of identity digital identities

100
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,919
have opened up new avenues and we will

101
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,770
hear later on especially from Andrew

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,740
Harper from UNHCR and how that has

103
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,590
helped to register refugees but of

104
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,370
course with any kind of digital new

105
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,929
revolution there's always a question of

106
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,950
human rights concerns in the sense of

107
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:48,520
the right to privacy and the right to

108
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,670
your digital identity and of course you

109
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,440
can imagine it's it's not

110
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,030
it's not hard and you don't really have

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,480
to engage in any kind of conspiracy

112
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,940
theory but you can easily imagine that

113
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,280
identity data in the context of refugees

114
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,380
and in the context of migration that

115
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,580
gets into the wrong hands you can easily

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,440
imagine what what that amounts to also

117
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,830
of course to to other government

118
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,620
agencies who seek surveillance or even

119
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,380
imagine you you've deserted from war or

120
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,670
you're part of a persecuted minority

121
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,380
then of course you but those data in the

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:32,610
wrong hands can can have a very very

123
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:34,680
very detrimental effect in in all of our

124
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,110
development cooperation we do as the

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,510
German government we pay when one of the

126
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,340
fundamental principles is the respect

127
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,620
and regard for human rights and that's

128
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,039
not only offline but also increasingly

129
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,560
online and a lot of you have heard of

130
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,590
agenda 2030 that includes the

131
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,690
sustainable development goals which have

132
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,409
been agreed with in the United Nations

133
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,110
in 2015 one fundamental principle there

134
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,230
is leave no one behind leave no man

135
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,570
behind means human rights Accord to

136
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,300
everyone every single one especially

137
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,450
very what vulnerable groups and in the

138
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,300
context of migration and refugee and

139
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,580
flight of course those groups are very

140
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,320
vulnerable and their human rights

141
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,830
especially also their right to privacy

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:28,290
privacy and digital identity have to be

143
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:30,240
respected part of that we're trying to

144
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,860
do through something that has been very

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,410
much debated and has gone through the

146
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,720
media over the last few months and

147
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,300
that's the Global Compact on migration

148
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,020
the Global Compact on migration has the

149
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,640
great advantage to actually comply with

150
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,380
human rights standards and actually

151
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,210
explicitly state that any action taken

152
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,730
under this Global Compact has to be

153
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,270
under a human rights-based approach and

154
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,610
also the Global Compact for Refugees

155
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,639
which is the lesser debated but second

156
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,539
compact that that

157
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,840
fits into that that area in in those all

158
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:13,259
governments are obliged to respect human

159
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,239
rights and those of course include that

160
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:21,360
the right to privacy and digital privacy

161
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,099
but today we've got many speakers here

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,319
who know much more about this than I

163
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:29,248
actually do so I'll limit my

164
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,919
introductory remarks to simply now try

165
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:34,979
welcoming the others and thanking you

166
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,139
very much for for having us and thank

167
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,360
you for being here and I'm very much

168
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,330
looking forward myself to learning a lot

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,419
more about digital identity and where

170
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,909
that balance is between the great

171
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,620
benefits of identifying people but also

172
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,919
protecting their human rights thank you

173

responsible uses of data and technology

202
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,510
in advocacy and social justice and the

203

decentralized identity globally so

213

219
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,200
and the developed world thank you very

220
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,390
much for being here together the three

221
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,120
of you as you can see we have kind of a

222
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,740
distribution of expertise on the panel

223
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,940
andrew has a wealth of expertise

224
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,730
actually working in refugee context and

225
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:11,060
managing so-called refugee crisis Zahra

226
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,520
with her expertise on digital ethics and

227
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,380
you as sort of the practical implementer

228
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,390
of digital identity solutions and that's

229
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,089
very much so the focus of the discussion

230
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,069
we want to bring in for the format I'd

231
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,470
like to start off by asking each of our

232
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:27,320
panelists make a mini interview set of

233
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,899
questions before engaging together in a

234
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,910
discussion and also bringing all of you

235
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,500
in it is kind of hard to see you but we

236
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,719
know you're out there so if you want

237
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,070
please don't be shy and we're looking

238
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,490
forward to joining you joining this

239
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,839
discussion

240
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,520
Andrew I'd like to cut it off with you

241
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,350
because I think it's important to give

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,420
everybody the right kind of context

243
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,550
exactly what we are speaking about in

244
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,680
the midst of one of the world's largest

245
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,589
refugee crisis or perhaps the largest

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,729
refugee crisis you established Satar II

247
00:10:54,589 --> 00:11:00,560
and as rack to refugee camps I'd like to

248
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,020
begin with a question how identity

249
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,119
matters in exactly these contexts of

250
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,209
your work perhaps you can give us a

251
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,390
little bit of an insight what appoints

252
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:19,819
the right identity has in those spaces

253
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:22,310
and for people living there it's on um

254
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,839
so thank you very much okay and and

255
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,369
thank you everyone for coming this

256
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,910
morning the there's a massive effort in

257
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,670
regards to the Syrian operation and it

258
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,209
wasn't just obviously one organization

259
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:39,469
or individuals alone and we were there

260
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:42,680
in order to support the government of

261
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:46,790
Jordan the population of Jordan who were

262
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,020
having their borders kept open for tens

263
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,219
of thousands of people coming across

264
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,930
there's actually we're getting about

265
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:56,089
5,000 people per day coming across in

266
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,620
order for Jordan to control the

267
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,029
situation because you must you must

268
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,640
remember that Jordan is in a pretty

269
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,589
rough neighborhood they've had to deal

270
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,899
with Iraq they've had to deal with the

271
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:10,339
situation in Syria they had a Palestine

272
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:13,399
Israel next door so security and the

273
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:16,720
credibility of the operations were there

274
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,920
their foremost concern and so for them

275
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,450
they had to they put in place a

276
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,180
registration system even before we came

277
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,480
in play and so we worked with the

278
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,680
Jordanian government to ensure that the

279
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,230
registration system that the government

280
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,620
put in play and they already walking at

281
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,600
biometrics talking to account the needs

282
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,279
of the populations and we're done as

283
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,050
effectively and efficiently as possible

284
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,760
so in many aspects this is where the

285
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,790
world is also going that governments are

286
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,829
taking more and more responsibility for

287
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,529
registration and UNHCR and other

288
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:52,378
agencies are just trying to ensure that

289
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:55,759
the best practices are put into play and

290
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,259
so in relation to the digital

291
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,939
registration there we found that one

292
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,790
providing people for digital identity

293
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,319
provided an access to territory which

294
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,639
was the most important element so they

295
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,670
were not being bounced back into Syria

296
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,920
but to when they had a digital identity

297
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,800
that allowed them to leave the what was

298
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,800
basically closed camps so they were able

299
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,719
to leave the triandos Rock because no

300
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,219
matter what people say about refugee

301
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,199
camps they still refugee camps and no

302
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,779
one wants to be in a refugee camp so

303
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,248
this allowed gave the confidence to the

304
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,220
government to allow refugees to leave

305
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:32,370
the camps and to relocate to urban

306
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,809
centers were then able to use just to be

307
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,550
very quick we're obviously then used the

308
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,860
digital identity the biometrics that we

309
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,839
we captured from the refugees with their

310
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:44,249
concurrence to be able to access

311
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,110
everything from cache through a TMS and

312
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,670
then link that up to assistance which

313
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,990
has been provided by a host of other

314
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:54,449
organizations and agencies so what will

315
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,949
probably be discussing here at great

316
00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:00,240
length is how secure is the data and

317
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:03,000
what was the willingness of the refugees

318
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,819
to come forward and be registered if

319
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,899
you're dealing with refugees who've been

320
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:10,829
suffered so much in Syria for the

321
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,149
previous four some substantial time the

322
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,250
feeling was that no one would come to

323
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:15,809
UNHCR and register because they the

324
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,610
refugees themselves would be concerned

325
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,800
about what would happen with the data

326
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,899
they would they didn't trust anyone

327
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,040
they'd been they'd suffered a great deal

328
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,990
from the previous regime and so to come

329
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,389
forward and register and share their

330
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,439
experiences and their details people say

331
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,949
this wasn't going to happen

332
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:37,349
but very soon after we started we had

333
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,910
thousands of people come through and so

334
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,589
that was a demonstration that people

335
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,750
wanted to be registered and they wanted

336
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,250
to avail themselves of protection that's

337
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,179
a very important point to make because

338
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,949
as I said in the opening remarks we take

339
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,509
these things for granted and the sort of

340
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:54,120
apprehensions that we feel people might

341
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:55,520
have to give the data as you said upon

342
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,980
registration

343
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,600
sort of in the practicalities if one

344
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,160
finds themselves in the situation of

345
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,460
course the benefits of doing so

346
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,680
completely outweigh and and there is

347
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,540
yeah probably not much choice that

348
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,579
people have so the fact that you had

349
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,170
people queuing up to do this with all

350
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,090
the things that you listed that they

351
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,530
would get access to if they did so of

352
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,080
course it's clear that people would want

353
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,150
to write but I'd like to well I just

354
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,310
reek how quickly access to territory

355
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,959
freedom of movement access to resources

356
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,699
some of the points that you outlined

357
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,280
that of course you need to prove

358
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,340
yourself anyway and show some form of

359
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,410
identity for now you introduce biometric

360
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:38,810
registration systems in these refugee

361
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:40,790
camps and I'd like to ask you the

362
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,619
difference between sort of analog

363
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,800
registration systems and other forms of

364
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,900
identity and digital registration

365
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,120
systems and identity management systems

366
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,870
where do you see the specific benefits

367
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,060
and moving from the one to the other

368
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,640
very quickly it's um it's one is much

369
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,469
more accountable than the other where

370
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,480
we've introduced biometrics and just

371
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,920
from a straight accountability for

372
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,340
resources which have been allocated to

373
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,770
us and I must add that where we're at a

374
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,360
time when there's less resources being

375
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,160
provided for humanitarian operations

376
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,370
when actually the needs are going up and

377
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,439
so we have to do whatever we can so we

378
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,340
have to ensure that the the person who

379
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,960
is we have qualified to receive

380
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,010
assistance the most vulnerable the most

381
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,260
protected or the ones who actually

382
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,900
receive it and so through the biometrics

383
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,970
we can be we can ensure that the person

384
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,220
with that unique identifier is the one

385
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,320
who receives assistance and where we

386
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,500
have introduced biometrics around the

387
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,250
world we've usually seen a reduction in

388
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,630
the numbers of we've been like what's a

389
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,850
deduplication or reduction in the

390
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,610
account the potential forward by

391
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,870
anywhere between 17 and 30 percent so

392
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,240
the use of biometrics to provide

393
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,890
increased accountability results in

394
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,970
significant savings particularly when

395
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,770
you look at operations which are

396
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,270
spending anywhere a quarter of a billion

397
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,670
dollars per year so if you can make

398
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,199
savings of ten percent plus this is

399
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,630
significant which can then be redirected

400
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,640
to the most vulnerable

401
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,930
so refugees of finding that when they

402
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,490
have biometrics they are less

403
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,699
intimidated by other groups to give up

404
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,890
their ration cards or to possibly make

405
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,920
false claims and so we found that

406
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:28,010
refugees actually want to be register

407
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,720
with biometrics because that provides

408
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,320
with greater guarantee that their

409
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,350
identity can not be misused by others so

410
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,439
when a I'm gonna move along the panel I

411
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:42,830
read an article called the refugee

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,210
identity from pork urine leading up to

413
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,070
this panel and I want to quote from it

414
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,570
very briefly he says in the article the

415
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,520
attack service of the individual

416
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,830
identity is all the points at which

417
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,710
identity is rollin or award to misuse or

418
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,230
abuse digitization increases the attack

419
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,510
service by linking identity data to

420
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,310
other systems making the refugee more

421
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,740
vulnerable while decreasing the

422
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:07,940
capability of the refugee to mitigate

423
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,220
that vulnerability having heard what

424
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,000
Andrew said and sort of the need for

425
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,130
bringing in identity identification

426
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,850
processes but also taking that into

427
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,670
account

428
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,840
what would you say yeah I mean I guess I

429
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,820
think you brought up some really

430
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,490
interesting points I guess in the in

431
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,230
response to the to the point about

432
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,940
increased accountability I'd be really

433
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,890
interested to know what a digital

434
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,350
identification system looks like the

435
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,000
increases accountability not in terms of

436
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,500
the humanitarian operations but

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,520
accountability to the people who are

438
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,140
being registered and I think you know I

439
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,060
it's fair that I guess in some cases

440
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,210
people are very keen to be registered in

441
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,690
order to get certain yeah access to

442
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:53,240
certain services but I also wonder what

443
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,010
does informed consent look like when

444
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,620
you're saying you have to go through

445
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,080
these systems in order to access what

446
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,639
you know shelter access to territory

447
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,439
that kind of thing because I think I

448
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
mean an you know maybe this is an open

449
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,890
question of whether there was an

450
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,160
alternative system that didn't require

451
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,590
people to give up biometric data I'm

452
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,410
also reminded of in I think it was

453
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,449
November 2018 the there was a group of

454
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,060
ringing in the in a refugee camp in

455
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,270
Cox's Bazaar and Bangladesh

456
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,560
who actually went on a three-day strike

457
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,629
directly in response to the way that

458
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,780
UNHCR was collecting their biometric

459
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,980
data so I think you know I think it's

460
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,740
very context-specific

461
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,120
they have some very very detailed very

462
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,250
very detailed manifesto they're

463
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,870
incredibly well organized but the points

464
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,210
included things like not being consulted

465
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,760
about how their data was being collected

466
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:46,060
not being sure who the data was being

467
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,490
shared with not having any alternatives

468
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,649
so they they said that when they refused

469
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,230
to give their biometric data they were

470
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,990
blocked from leaving a certain small

471
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,870
area and for me that's very much not

472
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,870
informed consent and we I would say that

473
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,520
we all have a responsibility to kind of

474
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,780
prioritize the rights of people who have

475
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,150
been particularly the rain you're

476
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,700
refugees in coming out of Syria who have

477
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,370
been already so persecuted to think

478
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,680
about what their response or what their

479
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,939
rights and what they want more than what

480
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,910
would be potentially easier on the

481
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,650
operational side and then I guess

482
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:25,530
another topic that heavily comes into

483
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:28,270
plays as you mentioned in earlier Andrew

484
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,730
the dynamics between the state actors

485
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:33,730
and and different actors that come into

486
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,140
play the may be also private sector

487
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,850
companies which we'll get to in a minute

488
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,950
fighting different identity solutions

489
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,719
but of course also the power dynamic

490
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,280
between you and agency are and and the

491
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
countries you're operating in yeah I

492
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,030
mean I think the other thing to add to

493
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,980
that is and this is something that we've

494
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,480
been doing some research around lived

495
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,580
effects of digital identification

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,950
systems in the refugee context one thing

497
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,439
that comes up a lot is what is the

498
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,970
recourse for refugees or for people who

499
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,980
don't feel like their data is being

500
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,480
handled in a responsible way what can

501
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,340
they do

502
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,110
given that UN agencies are immune from

503
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,879
national legal systems what are the

504
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,830
legal accountability processes that

505
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,630
anyone can go through to say this was

506
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,210
not done well there was a whatever a

507
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,680
data breach even you know something like

508
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,600
that there's currently it's currently

509
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,060
very blurry and maybe maybe you have

510
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,790
answers to this as to what people can do

511
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,790
to you know to assert their rights so

512
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:26,690
consent and accountability other other

513
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,180
critical aspects that we haven't yet

514
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,190
and in regard to data protection and

515
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,680
Identity Management for in these

516
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,480
contexts yeah I mean I think for me

517
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,370
there's a difference between a digital

518
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,220
identification system that includes

519
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:43,100
biometric data and one that doesn't we

520
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,280
did some research in I think 2016-2017

521
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,110
looking at the specific problem that

522
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,730
biometrics were seeking to solve and we

523
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,100
found overwhelmingly that the problem

524
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,860
from the monetary incide was around

525
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,439
reducing fraud and deduplication like

526
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,810
Andrew mentioned but there were cases

527
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,570
and but there were many cases where the

528
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,940
risk of gathering that data was so huge

529
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,189
potential risk was so huge and for

530
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,140
example in the Rehana context there big

531
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,880
concern is that the biometric data that

532
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,410
is being collected by the Bangladeshi

533
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,240
authorities in collaboration with the

534
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,250
own HCR would be shared back with the

535
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,780
Myanmar government who have just or who

536
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,330
are committing a genocide against those

537
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,860
people so to me there's it's it's very

538
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,970
hard to see the use case in which

539
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:29,209
gathering such personal immutable

540
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,890
unchangeable data could ever be in

541
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:35,450
respond be kind of reasonable in

542
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:41,810
response to reducing fraud to one

543
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:46,040
respond before move on just just quickly

544
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:48,950
the but the reinga situation is probably

545
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,350
also it happens in almost every refugee

546
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,720
situation where people are scared

547
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,669
they're concerned they don't want david

548
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,100
be shared they don't know why they're

549
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,440
giving up the data and that was

550
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,020
certainly the case last year like I went

551
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,520
to Bangladesh a couple of times I was

552
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,980
involved in the registration in

553
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,620
preparing for the registration the the

554
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,990
population coming out of Miami were

555
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,580
obviously extremely traumatized they

556
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,950
didn't want to be forced back and they

557
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,199
did not want to be registered but over

558
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,170
time our teams have been discussing with

559
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,060
them we've not a just UNHCR bird but all

560
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,040
the humanitarian actors there saying why

561
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,990
is why particularly for the row hangars

562
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,300
why it is so important to ever to have

563
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,520
an identity and so now I can basically

564
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,909
say there's at least a thousand people

565
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,350
and more people coming per day and being

566
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,269
registered and seeking that identity

567
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,519
this was not the case six months ago

568
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:44,929
because the issue of trust we mentioned

569
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,609
the issue of legal recourse the legal

570
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,619
recourse is important but most important

571
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,968
for UNHCR and others is a credibility if

572
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:51,830
we do not have the credibility with the

573
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:54,109
refugee population and the trust with

574
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,820
the refugee situation with the rift with

575
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:59,049
refugees and with the host authorities

576
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:02,389
everything else is basically lost so we

577
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:03,649
we having this feedback mechanism having

578
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:07,099
the trust with the communities is

579
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:09,080
absolutely important for us we can we do

580
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:10,849
things better absolutely and I think one

581
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,899
of the issues that having a digital

582
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:16,968
identity offers us is to make use of

583
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:18,619
feedback mechanisms how can we do this

584
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:21,739
in a more collaborative manner certainly

585
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:25,968
not just from UNHCR how can we have much

586
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:27,739
more independent CWC community working

587
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:30,709
with communicating with communities

588
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:33,669
feedback mechanisms that are independent

589
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:35,899
and can actually report back to

590
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:37,129
objective interlocutors about what is

591
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,589
going on what are the concerns of

592
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:42,918
populations so take that into account

593
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:44,690
very much informed consent we try and do

594
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,869
as much as we can in that regards we can

595
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,179
do better and we must be doing better in

596
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:53,779
relation to accessing services accessing

597
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:56,809
protection everyone has a choice if you

598
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:00,079
look at biometrics elderly people with

599
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:03,639
cataracts often cannot have their RSS

600
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:07,158
scan so we look at biometrics

601
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:09,678
facilitating multiplying our delivery

602
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,200
assistance protection mechanisms but

603
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,729
everyone has got the option to opt in or

604
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,820
opt out and I think this is one of one

605
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:18,529
of the the key areas and again all the

606
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,999
reports and all the elements that you're

607
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:22,459
raising we take into account when we

608
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:24,799
need to take those into account what

609
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:27,169
recourse again goes back to the trust

610
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,119
and credibility so we need to be

611
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:31,339
listening to the populations trust and

612
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,439
credibility good keywords I'll take to

613
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:35,149
bring you into the conversation hurt

614
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,489
your original movement with the

615
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,529
blockchain came from realization of how

616
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:41,010
difficult it was to open a bank account

617
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:44,010
for refugees in Europe

618
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,660
so I'd like to ask you to share that

619
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,250
experience with us know that your point

620
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:50,640
of inspiration to get into this whole

621
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:53,790
this whole business so basically our

622
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,220
project started at during their refugee

623
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:59,070
crisis in Europe from a realization that

624
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,190
was just mentioned that we I happened to

625
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,080
visit the refugee camp in Norway and it

626
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,330
turned out that it's more expensive for

627
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,309
someone to go into the city then for me

628
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,860
to travel out because I can pay with

629
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:13,139
card just for the distance of the trip

630
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,840
but someone without a bank account bank

631
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,929
card has to pay for the entire bus fare

632
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,260
and that was like okay they get like 300

633
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:24,570
euro a month and they can travel cheaper

634
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,370
and we had a long discussion and the

635
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,620
person we interviewed being living in

636
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,879
Norway speaks perfect Norwegian but

637
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,340
can't have a bank account because of

638
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,130
legal reasons and that was like shocking

639
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,580
like this person speaks better Norwegian

640
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,440
than I do

641
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,570
understands the culture better but they

642
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,070
she just can't get a job in Norway you

643
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,168
need to have a bank account to be able

644
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,530
to sign a contract so it was like oh

645
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:48,780
this is like crazy like we can't talk

646
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,428
about Social Inclusion and like openness

647
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:55,020
and everything when they can just have

648
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:56,580
no chance to start and so I was familiar

649
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,590
with the technology blockchain and we

650
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,059
started to look into could it be

651
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,010
possible to create a solution that

652
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,660
enables them to access our financial

653
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,660
ecosystem and not like an alternative

654
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,299
cryptocurrency based and that's how we

655
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,000
stepped onto the story of banking for

656
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,740
Refugees three years ago so I'd like to

657
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,410
ask you just as Andrew sort of outlines

658
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,750
the different use cases let's say that

659
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,669
you need an identity for for you to

660
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,200
outline the different solutions that are

661
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,570
out there today we've talked a bit about

662
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,940
biometrics but can you just give us a

663
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,080
general overview of digital identity

664
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,650
solutions of on the market sure but I

665
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,840
think it's important to go one step back

666
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,540
and like digital identity can be a lot

667
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,820
of things so mostly what we are talking

668
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,950
about our personal identifiers that can

669
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,840
prove who you are that there's like that

670
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,299
are related to your persona your birth

671
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,730
registration your biometrics for for

672
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,668
authentication perspective but it's not

673
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:56,519
particularly or like

674
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:58,259
your bank card is a digital identity

675
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,570
Esper because whenever you pay you

676
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,869
authenticate yourself towards a system

677
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:07,439
which is a payment trail but it is also

678
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:09,119
an identity so like mostly in these

679
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,979
situations we are talking about the

680
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,559
lower levels of identities which can

681
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:17,009
enable the access to go higher into

682
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,320
service reown however the protection of

683
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:23,249
these different RIANZ can differ and

684
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:31,559
maybe should be fir and the question was

685
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:34,709
different solutions classic so like

686
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,989
basically there is a range of different

687
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:40,079
solution one you might have heard it's

688
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:42,989
called Facebook it's great if you are

689
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:45,359
willing to give up your data from a

690
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:48,179
technology perspective the Gateway to

691
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,468
their system is an open source both

692
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,869
Facebook and Google use the same

693
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:53,399
technology however like they store

694
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:57,238
everything that you do and they collect

695
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:59,070
even more that you don't know about well

696
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:01,349
we can argue very along it why is it not

697
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,609
so good their business perspective but

698
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:05,999
they are much more effective than any

699
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:07,739
other identity service ever before the

700
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:10,019
largest government-issued system

701
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:12,359
currently is in India which is a

702
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:15,599
biometric based identification system

703
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,509
which they basically they collected

704
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,729
north of 1 billion biometric identities

705
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:24,229
of all their citizens in roughly 3 years

706
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:27,059
it is an insane large government push

707
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:29,099
the only issue was that back then when

708
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,249
the system was created India didn't have

709
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:34,889
privacy rights there was like none so

710
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:37,769
donors of the system had access to data

711
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:40,468
not and it wasn't only biometric but

712
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:43,739
like that was the bottom layer of India

713
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:46,559
stack which was access to banking access

714
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:48,570
to insurance and so on and so on and so

715
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,839
like donors of the system had access to

716
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:55,289
to the stack information it has changed

717
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,839
it is better now but it is still not

718
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:59,729
perfect which is a government system

719
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,489
there is like the Estonian identity

720
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:03,979
which many of you might have heard this

721
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:06,090
is a much better implemented

722
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:09,330
government-issued identity

723
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:11,459
has distributed nature so it's not like

724
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,158
one system manages everything it's they

725
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,070
created a system after their man got

726
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,690
hacked where the different in tissues

727
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,270
and in the government communicate with

728
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,850
each other and sort of the hopefully

729
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,918
next three on which my company and a lot

730
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,840
of other companies are standing for

731
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,539
itself serene identity or self managed

732
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,000
identity we are basically data storage

733
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,820
and data management are happening on

734
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,039
user side so the user is able to store

735
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,260
data in a way that it's technically

736
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,350
provable that he or she is the owner and

737
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,840
also able to consent at a-- which is

738
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:49,350
used for different service accesses so

739
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,750
what it would create is the second is is

740
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,209
the ability to access every level of

741
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,419
these these like different realms of of

742
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:01,020
services with different ways of using

743
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:03,510
your identity because for example when i

744
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,700
entered here i had to show my government

745
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,830
ID but they are uninterested in my name

746
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,620
but it had my actual number on it it had

747
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,449
my birth date so I gave up theoretically

748
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,520
a lot more information than they were

749
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,980
actually interested or have the rights

750
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,049
to be interested in so being able to

751
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,210
create subsets of your identity which

752
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:24,480
you can still prove digitally which is

753
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,940
much better than a plastic card is a it

754
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,299
can become extremely powerful if

755
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:32,010
implemented well I want to ask you two

756
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:35,129
more questions on this topic so

757
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:38,549
classically the state the nation-state

758
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:44,669
is the provider of your your passport

759
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:46,830
your formal identity and and and you as

760
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,120
a citizen get the sort of the general

761
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,830
right to have one but it's something

762
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,408
that's of co-owned between you and the

763
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:55,559
state in this version of self sovereign

764
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,559
identity is this something that you

765
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:02,039
visit happening on a government

766
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,379
supported public blockchain or how would

767
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,658
that exactly take shape who would be

768
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,399
sort of the manager of the system the

769
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,649
provider of the infrastructure behind it

770
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,689
and how does the self self report

771
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:18,120
actually work so I think the only

772
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,770
globally accepted identity is Facebook

773
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,560
and

774
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:23,960
your passport the passport is actually

775
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,210
useful but the problem with that you

776
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,040
actually don't own it the government

777
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,750
owns your passport you are a user of it

778
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,310
you are subscribed by being the citizen

779
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,980
but if you are not a citizen anymore

780
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,010
it's not valid and if it's taken away

781
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,570
you can't prove you ever had it Andrew

782
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,250
mentioned that like a lot of people had

783
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,169
trust issues registering liens that are

784
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,410
the same happen when they enter in the

785
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:48,380
in Europe there was a huge black market

786
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,260
of Syrian passports because Syrians had

787
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,470
a simpler way to apply for citizenship

788
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,480
all across Europe and a Syrian can tell

789
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,420
the story that he's Asteria or she is a

790
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,490
Syrian while a person with a Syrian

791
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,570
passport can show a passport that he or

792
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,060
she is a Syrian

793
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:11,720
so like trust issues are to both

794
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:15,470
directions and going back to like to my

795
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,090
mind which again forget the question the

796
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:22,640
question was how does the self sovereign

797
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:24,439
cloud actually work and how would it be

798
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,540
a public blockchain with a public park

799
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,910
chain be state this provided

800
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,320
infrastructure how does it work what

801
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,760
role does the nation-state playing

802
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,929
future and where does the self sovereign

803
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,390
Park comment so we're not going to go

804
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,370
into blockchain because it's a

805
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,800
technology framework what's important to

806
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,929
understand itself so an identity doesn't

807
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,629
need blockchain and the blockchain

808
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:51,230
technology needs also an identity so

809
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:53,750
like what the whole not the whole but

810
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,240
like many companies are looking into is

811
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,610
only registering a public address on a

812
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,670
on a blockchain which is a publicly run

813
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,850
infrastructure not owned by anyone but

814
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:07,700
miners are creating security and upkeep

815
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,069
for the system but then only using that

816
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,720
own chain and they're moving

817
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,649
transactions in a secure environment but

818
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,879
off chain because basically a blockchain

819
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:18,649
identity which is using actively a

820
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,169
blockchain for transactions would be

821
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:24,409
like tweeting your digital life

822
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:26,629
constantly maybe not no one wants to use

823
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:28,550
it but if someone they can search for it

824
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,559
we didn't have knowledge it's it is

825
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:34,769
public so sub certain identities are

826
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:37,049
registering functions on a blockchain

827
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:39,868
but they're moving hopefully they are

828
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:41,369
moving off chain to store and manage the

829
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:44,369
transactions themselves and the data

830
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,979
itself so I know data should go every

831
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:48,569
one of object I'm guessing that some of

832
00:34:46,978 --> 00:34:50,009
the things you say would make some

833
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:53,429
people coming more from the sort of

834
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:56,219
public sector side or actually side a

835
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,719
little bit nervous and and I want to I

836
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,199
want to just try to take them apart a

837
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:02,670
little bit so a this sort of nobody owns

838
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,019
anything it's kind of a translucent

839
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,969
thing but there are private companies

840
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,948
sort of involved in some way or private

841
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:12,150
persons who are miners that seems like a

842
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:13,619
very sort of convoluted space which is a

843
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,059
very different thing to saying here's a

844
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,799
nation-state government that provides

845
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,630
you with your passport so that's one

846
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:20,038
thing that makes past people little bit

847
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,269
nervous the whole Facebook thing makes

848
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,559
me completely nervous on a whole

849
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:24,468
different level but maybe we'll get to

850
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,299
that in a minute

851
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:29,729
sorry pointed out earlier already the

852
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:31,140
question and also the dangers connected

853
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:33,149
with traceability there are many people

854
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,959
in the world who might not want their

855
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:39,179
identity bt as sort of a linear

856
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:41,759
traceable thing so as you pointed out I

857
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,679
would be were able to sort of I'd say

858
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:45,749
which bits of my identity I communicate

859
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,640
to who when but of course there's a file

860
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:49,649
ability in or technical systems and that

861
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,410
idea behind the blockchain sort of

862
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,679
locking in in an unchangeable way

863
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:58,109
information about me which could include

864
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,880
my nationality and that's maybe

865
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:02,130
something that I care to hide if I

866
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:08,279
become a refugee how does that come into

867
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:11,459
play so there is so there is the ability

868
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:12,959
to to destroy or or make these

869
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:14,698
identities disappear in most

870
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:16,558
implementations or hopefully and most

871
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:19,679
because there is an e-rep like a global

872
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,469
right the right to be forgotten which

873
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,349
should create a system where these

874
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:27,869
identities can be deleted my question is

875
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,969
that if I want to be deleted from the

876
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:31,650
German refugee system can I do that

877
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:33,679
under the right to be forgotten because

878
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,410
it's good that the technology enables

879
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,079
but is a nation-state under the right to

880
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,879
be forgotten scheme or can I become not

881
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,529
a Hungarian citizen anymore actually I

882
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,860
can't you have to be a citizen of a

883
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:47,650
country

884
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,540
unless your refugee but I can't become

885
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:54,130
on purpose just the refugee because it

886
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:57,040
sounds fun it's just sort of a side note

887
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:01,600
it's not only technology but from a

888
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,240
technology perspective like it's it is

889
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,980
all possible because it's like we create

890
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,759
the technology the really the end goal

891
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:12,090
is like what are the use cases you want

892
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,860
to apply it and how can we avoid

893
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,170
creating the ability to collect

894
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,930
everything that are related to these

895
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:21,610
identities so the blockchain is not that

896
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,440
big of a question because hopefully no

897
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,050
one will ever save any data on the

898
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,670
blockchain which is comes to identity

899
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:32,140
like at least like from like serious

900
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:36,070
projects so I don't think that is a

901
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:39,089
biggest concert for this debate but the

902
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:42,040
bigger question is how we can avoid

903
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:45,460
collecting this data because if it's

904
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:47,050
consent of all I someone can just gasps

905
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,490
please give me all your data and you can

906
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:54,100
become a citizen and then it's there is

907
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,959
an incentive to do that that's how it

908
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,700
works is it you can jump in if you like

909
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,220
it's also making you a little bit

910
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,500
nervous any mentions of Facebook is the

911
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:07,419
biggest trusted global identity platform

912
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:11,109
is whirring we can get that your your

913
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,550
words I think I guess I I mean I'm not

914
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:14,500
familiar with your company so this is

915
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:17,140
kind of a general a general concern I

916
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,210
have with mentions of identity and

917
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,040
blockchain and generally actually the

918
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:24,280
the kind of conflation between a

919
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,830
person's identity and an identification

920
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,080
system that conflation kind of makes me

921
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,840
nervous I mean we started with the

922
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,609
question Who am I and I think for me if

923
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,260
you'd asked me who are you 10 years ago

924
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,869
I would answer that very differently to

925
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:40,030
how I would now I think that part of

926
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,040
being human is kind of the fluid the

927
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,020
fluid nature of our identities and the

928
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,630
ability to change over time the ability

929
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,640
to present certain attributes to hide

930
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,530
certain attributes is an inherent part

931
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,560
of being human and being able to

932
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,450
interact with the system in a you know

933
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,890
sponsible way and i think the biggest

934
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,970
thing that came up for me and geraldine

935
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:02,470
you already brought it up a little bit

936
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:04,270
is this confusing accountability that I

937
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,069
think I'm not sure I entirely sure I

938
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,560
follow and I think going to your point I

939
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,450
feel like credibility but the

940
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,210
accountability is a huge part of credit

941
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,620
building credibility that having

942
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:17,140
objective or kind of external

943
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,060
accountability processes to say this did

944
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,060
not work for me is a huge part of

945
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,980
building credibility and Trust and then

946
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,630
yeah I guess the other I mean a big

947
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,490
question that I would have around the

948
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,070
the blockchain or private company

949
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,560
related private sector involvement in

950
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,090
all of this is GDP are like data

951
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,310
protection regulation if you were to say

952
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:40,060
I want to remove all of my data from

953
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:42,310
this blockchain or this company that

954
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,900
kind of thing I I have no idea how that

955
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,360
would be possible given that it's

956
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,780
immutable maybe that's also a question

957
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,190
how you address that having been

958
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,440
introduced last year how has that

959
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:58,240
affected your work um the GDP are weak

960
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,770
unhcr is probably like there's other

961
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,709
organizations who probably got even more

962
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:05,350
stringent data protection including ICRC

963
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,840
but as far as the UN is concerned

964
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,480
UNHCR was the first agency to put in a

965
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,900
data protection policy and guidelines

966
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,570
going back to 2015 so all the

967
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,970
discussions on data and refugee

968
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,400
protection cannot be distinguished like

969
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:25,839
but we have to be we have to have secure

970
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,150
data we have to have privacy not just in

971
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,860
theory but in practice because again it

972
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,470
goes back to the the trust and integrity

973
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:37,480
of everything we do if our systems get

974
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:40,359
hacked and people lose trust in who we

975
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,580
are as a protection agency then that's

976
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,860
that's that's goes to the core of our

977
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:49,720
mandate so when when we talk about

978
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:52,630
issues of identity in regards to privacy

979
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,689
many of the regulations the policies the

980
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:59,500
practices that we've put in place going

981
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:02,140
back to 2015 actually predated European

982
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,000
regulations and so what what I can say

983
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,560
is that where we try to be an alignment

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,960
as much as we can

985
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,450
and everything given given the world is

986
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,600
changing so rapidly given the capacity

987
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:17,049
to hack given the increasing value which

988
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,660
people put on personal data we also have

989
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:22,570
to be agile we also have to calibrate

990
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:26,410
our responses and L in our requirements

991
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:28,150
we've got a Data Protection Officer but

992
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,509
we need more like we need to be much

993
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:35,200
more serious because the capacity to

994
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:37,840
intercept - to hack into systems is also

995
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,129
growing so we as an organisation who

996
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,600
puts privacy and protection very core we

997
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,670
have to invest much more in our

998
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,529
understandings so as quite genuine sort

999
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,150
of saying about your studies are things

1000
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,980
that we actually take into very

1001
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,230
seriously the recommendations are things

1002
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,310
that we try to put into account we've

1003
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,250
actually got a data meeting in

1004
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:59,770
Copenhagen today where privacy and

1005
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,110
protection and how we can have more

1006
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,910
enhanced guidelines are in play so for

1007
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,140
any new technology that we put in play

1008
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,700
which could have an impact on data

1009
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,100
protection we have a data protection

1010
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,569
impact assessment to go through all

1011
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,069
these elements I was gonna ask because

1012
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,420
I'm sure that's a very difficult thing

1013
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:15,610
to balance sort of being open for

1014
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,490
innovation I know that you HDR's its own

1015
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,130
sort of innovation hub let's say and

1016
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,950
some ecosystem and trying to bring in

1017
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:25,900
new solutions that sort of do a better

1018
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,270
service to the people that you're trying

1019
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,490
to provide services for but yet having

1020
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,110
very little space to experiment of

1021
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,350
course because people's lives depend on

1022
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,660
it

1023
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,700
well the again I want to keep saying

1024
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:40,600
that you and a cell Protection Agency

1025
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,669
but innovation is no use to us if we if

1026
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,100
we jeopardize that protection space so

1027
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,870
what is key to almost everything that we

1028
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,480
do is to make sure that people are at

1029
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:51,339
the centre we try and ensure that we

1030
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,530
move forward on getting feedback

1031
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,610
mechanisms in play not just being UN HCR

1032
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,380
centric but across the whole

1033
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:58,030
humanitarian space we look at

1034
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,830
collaboration we look at making sure

1035
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:03,720
that we can bring things to scale so

1036
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:07,080
it's not it's not a situation where it's

1037
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,459
it's alien us to sort of look at

1038
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,290
innovation but also trying to ensure

1039
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,450
that we've got greater data security and

1040
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,610
data privacy what we what we have to try

1041
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,080
and balance is particularly an emergency

1042
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,960
situation how can we do our job better

1043
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,120
how can we improve

1044
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,670
how can we improve assistance and when

1045
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,529
it comes down to it we have to ensure

1046
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:28,680
that refugees and others including

1047
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,090
stateless persons have a choice so in

1048
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,720
the end we have to give them the dignity

1049
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:36,510
the the the trust in them that they will

1050
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,069
make them informed decisions I want to

1051
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:39,750
leave some time and space also for your

1052
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:42,540
questions and comments if you want to

1053
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,530
start bringing them in the people in the

1054
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,020
room who will come to you with a

1055
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,940
microphone have probably also better see

1056
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:50,490
you than I can so if you want to start

1057
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:54,150
raising your hands and guess from now on

1058
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,589
is a good good time to do so or maybe if

1059
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,450
I see correctly there's a microphone

1060
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:59,910
stand here in the middle and you could

1061
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:04,140
possibly use that as well if you want to

1062
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:05,580
step forward so you're trying to develop

1063
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,529
solutions with your company that will

1064
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,270
come into this context like how do you

1065
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,090
go about doing that just also in a

1066
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:14,520
practical way in terms of dialogues with

1067
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:16,440
organizations like even HCI also with

1068
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,810
maybe people like Zahra like how you try

1069
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,970
to build those solutions so we are

1070
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,710
focusing a lot on research from

1071
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,990
technology perspective and also we are

1072
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:26,910
at really actively like contributing to

1073
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:29,669
a larger knowledge group on supporting

1074
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:32,250
the whole movement if anyone is

1075
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:35,310
interested in south so an identity we

1076
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:38,040
created a paper called SSI paper if you

1077
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:40,020
search on Twitter hashtag SSI paper it

1078
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,230
will come up with German block chain

1079
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,120
Association which is a basically to

1080
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,550
support paper for like from every aspect

1081
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,930
why I serve so an identity can be

1082
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:52,170
beneficial what are the circumstances

1083
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:55,799
that it could be disadvantages and how

1084
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:58,650
public agencies can look at it and can

1085
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,170
understand it so anyone is interested

1086
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,450
just go on Twitter and SSI paper so

1087
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,030
that's like one part which we did which

1088
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,410
was a really large work but it really

1089
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,810
enables us to have an easier

1090
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,000
conversation because a lot of what we do

1091
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,430
is education education education and

1092
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,410
conversations to better understand every

1093
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:20,819
aspect and just reply quickly to Sarah

1094
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,190
how do you know that you are deleted

1095
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,590
from an other system that's nothing to

1096
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,000
do with lock chain because someone told

1097
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,830
you it happened

1098
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,270
because someone told it told me it

1099
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,370
happened him because I know that there's

1100
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,770
huge fines as part of the GDP are if

1101
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,660
they didn't that's the answer it's

1102
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,730
technology there is a way to solve it

1103
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:44,089
and they did completely so you have no

1104
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:46,920
trace I'm happy to explain how I think

1105
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:49,140
maybe as a comment from my side like

1106
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,300
preparing for the session I have to say

1107
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,609
like I found this one article that I

1108
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,620
cited earlier and then I found a

1109
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,860
plethora of articles that celebrate

1110
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:02,100
technology and that is a little bit part

1111
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:04,770
of my concern or perhaps also shared

1112
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,330
concern that a lot of these ideas are

1113
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:08,070
seen from a very technological

1114
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,770
perspective rather than a human centered

1115
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:15,540
perspective and there's a lot of hope

1116
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:18,540
put in the technological side but it

1117
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,310
it's a little bit of a it seems to have

1118
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,009
a little bit of a naivety attached to it

1119
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:25,799
especially taking into account that

1120
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:27,420
there are so many unforeseen things the

1121
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,550
question of function creep how do we

1122
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,180
design subsystems today that cannot be

1123
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,610
exploited

1124
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,879
tomorrow we cannot predict exactly how

1125
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:37,980
either politics or technology is going

1126
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,360
to develop so how do we yeah how do we

1127
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,800
design for future scenarios basically

1128
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,370
that's a pretty complicated question

1129
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,420
generally speaking like the communities

1130
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,000
from a technology perspective the

1131
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,820
community is following events differ

1132
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,480
than GDP our standards and privacy and

1133
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,190
think of future scenarios which our

1134
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,490
regulators are still very far from to

1135
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:05,880
understand or or to act it on and on the

1136
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,560
other side like like privacy is a big

1137
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,060
issue but the whole conversation started

1138
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,070
on there is 1 billion people who don't

1139
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,410
have identity but they also don't have

1140
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:15,690
smart phone or even carrier service

1141
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,420
where they are mostly so like what are

1142
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,790
solutions that can be delivered to them

1143
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,700
and have the future capability to become

1144
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,680
like part of a global software and

1145
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,100
identity network or an interoperable

1146
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,080
identity without maybe all the level of

1147
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,150
privacy requirements but but the ability

1148
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:35,880
to deliver at least some form of

1149
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:38,130
identity to people so that they can be

1150
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,890
registered they can be missed from

1151
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:42,619
school from health care

1152
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,690
and then they can as they develop their

1153
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:47,299
identity and their presence in society

1154
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:49,130
they can actually access to other

1155
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:52,009
services that are built on because

1156
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:54,109
currently no identity system talks to

1157
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,630
each others the UNHCR's identity system

1158
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:58,940
don't communicate with virtual programs

1159
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,839
identity system yet this is such a

1160
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,640
tricky thing

1161
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,680
it is such a tricky question that you

1162
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,029
brought up and I am reminded of a panel

1163
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,970
that we did quite a couple of years ago

1164
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:10,900
on the topic of big data and developing

1165
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:13,279
context and I remember you being very

1166
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,410
very clear on the question that you

1167
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:18,049
cannot balance human rights like that it

1168
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,609
doesn't work to say oh but people need

1169
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:21,460
something more so they don't get the

1170
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:24,680
right to privacy because they're hungry

1171
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:27,319
I'm what would you respond today I mean

1172
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:32,299
kind of similar to Republic at 2015 and

1173
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:33,470
I think who are you think it I would

1174
00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:34,819
actually be really interested in this

1175
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:37,160
goes back to something you were saying

1176
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:38,869
earlier to think about so those 1

1177
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,359
billion people who don't have access to

1178
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:43,760
a digital identification mechanism what

1179
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,069
is the kind of digital identification

1180
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,440
system that they want so rather than us

1181
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:50,509
sitting here and saying you know what

1182
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,000
they want self sovereign identity how do

1183
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:54,559
we get it to them I would be much more

1184
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,480
interested in kind of the flip side

1185
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,279
saying for example one thing that really

1186
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,660
surprised me with the Rohini case was

1187
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:01,220
one of the reasons that they were

1188
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,640
striking was that they specifically

1189
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:07,160
wanted the label rania on their cards

1190
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,650
and in many other contexts the the idea

1191
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,140
of having a label of your ethnicity on

1192
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:14,779
an identification card is unthinkable

1193
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,859
and horrible and that was a very I think

1194
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:17,029
a very good example of how

1195
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:20,869
context-specific

1196
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:23,269
a lot of this is so the idea that yeah I

1197
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,799
think we have to start with respecting

1198
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:26,779
people's rights respecting their dignity

1199
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,849
starting from that place asking them

1200
00:49:26,779 --> 00:49:31,130
what kind of system makes sense for them

1201
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:32,809
in their context why do they need a

1202
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,339
digital identification card what are the

1203
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,170
problems that they are trying to solve

1204
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,069
what are the barriers that are standing

1205
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,009
in their way that a digital

1206
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:43,250
identification system of some kind could

1207
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:45,289
solve for them I think anything that is

1208
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,700
kind of us saying you know what you

1209
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:49,339
actually need this more than you need

1210
00:49:46,700 --> 00:50:00,589
your right to privacy is it just seems

1211
00:49:49,339 --> 00:50:01,038
very colonial to me what we're seeing it

1212
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,920
more and more

1213
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,630
the days of old when refugees would come

1214
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,769
across into a refugee camp and be

1215
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:08,539
registered by UNHCR

1216
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:12,279
a fast disappearing it's still the case

1217
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:14,509
you have situations such as in Miami

1218
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:16,220
refugees coming across into Bangladesh

1219
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:18,769
they don't really have any choice they

1220
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:22,279
came to cooter blonde camp they were

1221
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:23,689
they were had a very rough registration

1222
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,549
to begin with because they were

1223
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:27,319
concerned plus you had 800,000 people

1224
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:28,970
come but more and more it's becoming

1225
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:31,369
more of a context that we're seeing of

1226
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:33,589
populations going through say from the

1227
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:35,809
Sahel to North Africa towards Europe or

1228
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:38,089
from the Venezuela situation people are

1229
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:40,700
bypassing traditional registration and

1230
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:44,808
they're looking for their own solutions

1231
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,720
and so more and more we have to not come

1232
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:49,490
from like a northern Western un

1233
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,730
perspective to sort of say this is what

1234
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:54,919
you should have as far as an identity

1235
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,559
and this is the type of technology that

1236
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,809
we will use we have to adapt and sort of

1237
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,009
say okay what is it that you want what

1238
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:03,079
is it that you need what does the

1239
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:04,789
minimum viable data we need in order to

1240
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,559
better protect and assist you and how

1241
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:09,440
can we work with others to ensure that

1242
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,230
you're in the best position to achieve

1243
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,880
your goals in a more dignified way

1244
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:15,109
because like if you go back to the

1245
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,829
situation that were being faced with

1246
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:20,150
with the Syrian crisis Syrian crisis

1247
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:22,150
regards to Europe when we had so many

1248
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:25,789
people going towards some Europe and

1249
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,680
2015/2016 every academic institution or

1250
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:30,200
geek basically came up with their own

1251
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,480
app to sort of communicate with refugees

1252
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,980
most of them were useless most of them

1253
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,920
were not trusted most and were

1254
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,569
irrelevant to refugees because we tried

1255
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,700
to sort of say this is what they need to

1256
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:42,380
better communicate like what refugees

1257
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,390
will choose is what's useful for them

1258
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,970
they will use whatsapp they may use

1259
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:48,710
Facebook but then if Facebook is lost

1260
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,509
its credibility then they'll go / that

1261
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,069
they will go to telegram then we use

1262
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:54,049
what they believe is most important for

1263
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:56,538
them so it goes back to saying

1264
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:59,390
digital identity is needed for

1265
00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:01,930
populations as a basis but what's more

1266
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,299
important is that that digital identity

1267
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,799
protected and is putting them in a

1268
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,290
manner which is of most use to the

1269
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,849
individual thank you but you want to

1270
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:12,970
respond quickly no I mean I was just

1271
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:14,380
gonna say I totally agree with what you

1272
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,399
were saying and some of the the research

1273
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,410
that we're doing right now is looking

1274
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,630
into you know precisely what are those

1275
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:21,578
those lived effects that are sometimes

1276
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:23,920
hard to see if we're not kind of

1277
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:25,750
specifically looking for them we have a

1278
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,210
interventional question if I could see

1279
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:29,980
correctly it's this conversation here

1280
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,200
today very much builds on a conversation

1281
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,140
we had last year on the same stage

1282
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,790
actually and Kirschstein actor was one

1283
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:43,210
of the panelists then also from UNHCR

1284
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:44,410
please Carr continuation of last year's

1285
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:49,240
discussion even for those who weren't

1286
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:50,890
there last year but what I realize no

1287
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,419
longer being with UNHCR is that

1288
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,980
obviously it's a niche discussion it's

1289
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,270
because it's it we are talking about

1290
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:59,890
digital identity about refugees which

1291
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,759
are very vulnerable and therefore it has

1292
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,368
its merits

1293
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:07,660
however I believe that the maybe the

1294
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:09,520
organizers of republika 2020 maybe

1295
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,558
should be thinking of having a broader

1296
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,160
discussion on digital identity because I

1297
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,750
am of the opinion that there are new

1298
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,180
regulations coming everyone talks about

1299
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:22,750
gdpr but the European countries for

1300
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:26,879
instance have allowed have have new

1301
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:29,980
regulations coming when for instance the

1302
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,960
digital private companies identity

1303
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:35,490
companies will be accredited and have

1304
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,960
the right to operate there is another

1305
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:42,368
regulation coming which will allow

1306
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:44,710
financial services provider to run all

1307
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:47,829
your bank accounts your Google pays your

1308
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:50,410
Apple pays and descended and I would

1309
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:52,869
think that most of us 10 years from now

1310
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:55,240
will be subscribing to a digital

1311
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:58,450
identity company who will manage for us

1312
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,189
our digital identity and what is

1313
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:02,109
happening right now is that business

1314
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:05,290
models are being sawed left right and

1315
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:08,680
centre how this could be done and how

1316
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:11,829
could be this beneficial to the

1317
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,140
companies obviously and and maybe a

1318
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:14,650
blockchain comes very often across and

1319
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,109
especially

1320
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,810
this idea of self sovereign that you

1321
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:22,600
know this is we are at last realizing

1322
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:25,360
the promise of the internet you know you

1323
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:28,330
know the the self the sovereign internet

1324
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,890
the free internet for everybody and I

1325
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:31,690
think what is really happening if you

1326
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,609
look at the the big companies who are

1327
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:35,950
doing research there that is exactly the

1328
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:38,670
same thing is happening again that the

1329
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:41,080
very big companies are researching

1330
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:44,020
digital identity how digital identity

1331
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,430
can be sold to each of us thank you

1332
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,530
thank you so much Carl that was very

1333
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:48,910
important points that you raised there

1334
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,720
you were nodding you were looking

1335
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:53,710
concerned can you let us know a little

1336
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,689
bit more about this

1337
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:59,440
EU biometric system that's being

1338
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:02,890
introduced so once that one step back to

1339
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,550
two regulations the EU is introducing or

1340
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:10,379
working on a proposal to create a wide

1341
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:12,790
refugee registration biometric system

1342
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,280
with all the consent that they would

1343
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:18,970
need as their decision is a nation state

1344
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,620
level decision without regards of how

1345
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:25,899
can someone opt out of this system and

1346
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:29,220
while talking about the Chinese credit

1347
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,650
scoring system how bad it is so like

1348
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,589
there is nothing black and right even

1349
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:38,830
the West is creating systems that are

1350
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:41,620
extremely violent towards privacy

1351
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,509
especially of refugees just because when

1352
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,470
you put the terrorism on anything it

1353
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:49,750
becomes like a very different topic and

1354
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:52,149
unfortunately the case of refugees very

1355
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:55,930
often mixed with with the potential

1356
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:58,330
effect of terrorism regarding the

1357
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:01,660
question like the quote I do agree with

1358
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:04,509
this UNHCR has the potential to become

1359
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,339
an identity provider from a very

1360
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:08,590
different perspective as of delivering

1361
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:11,500
these identities often very complicated

1362
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,720
as technology is not present whereas

1363
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:16,270
some of those companies that the

1364
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:19,569
gentlemen might have meant are mostly

1365
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:23,580
operating environment with very

1366
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:23,580
excessive act access to technology

1367
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,970
as we have already nearly reached the

1368
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:32,629
end of our panel I'd like to ask you all

1369
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:35,089
for sort of some closing remarks Carl

1370
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:37,250
gave a look into the future which maybe

1371
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:40,640
not all of us would feel is quite bright

1372
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:43,670
with identity being managed by a set of

1373
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,430
different or a field of different

1374
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,019
private sector companies looking ahead

1375
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,759
into the future and what we want in

1376
00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:51,589
terms of digital identity management

1377
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:52,970
although I would very much like to take

1378
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:54,589
it to account what you said Zara and I

1379
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,200
feel like we could also offer a platform

1380
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:59,269
here for some more inclusive discussions

1381
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,649
involving people who might be bent in a

1382
00:56:59,269 --> 00:57:02,868
better position to answer this question

1383
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,970
than I see on the panel today but

1384
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:08,569
looking into the future the digital

1385
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:10,970
identity solutions that we'd want what

1386
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:13,549
is it that we'd wish for what would be

1387
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:15,980
your wishes to them perhaps the as are

1388
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:18,140
the the people developing such solutions

1389
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,720
or managing and implementing such

1390
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,848
solutions same question for you and to

1391
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,490
and also for you would you like to start

1392
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:30,829
I'm happy to start so generally speaking

1393
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:34,519
privacy is becoming a new issue like

1394
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:38,059
much more people realizing that privacy

1395
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:39,740
is much more important and I can open a

1396
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:43,069
browser and I can do whatever I want

1397
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,899
because you leave traces and and there

1398
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:46,430
are people collecting those traces or

1399
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,950
their companies collecting those traces

1400
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:50,990
so access to privacy and being the

1401
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:52,220
ability to live in an environment when

1402
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,500
there are regulations around your

1403
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,288
privacy to protect you is very very

1404
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:01,069
important and for that you also need the

1405
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:02,960
ability to manage these traces and your

1406
00:58:01,069 --> 00:58:05,900
privacy so you need an identity

1407
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,519
management which has to align or even

1408
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,220
deliver higher standards than the

1409
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:13,098
regulation itself and I would say this

1410
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,799
is what we are working towards with the

1411
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:18,200
addition of how can it be delivered to

1412
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:22,180
situations which are not highly

1413
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,339
technically advanced yet thank you Sarah

1414
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:28,330
sure I think for me I'd start with

1415
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:30,880
really clear problem definition and that

1416
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:32,380
driven by kind of operational needs but

1417
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,450
also by the context and by the people

1418
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,220
who will be part of or who will be

1419
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,270
registered under that identification

1420
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:41,680
system thinking about the minimum viable

1421
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:43,120
to pick up yeah the minimum viable

1422
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,580
amount of data that needs to be

1423
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,500
collected and also what data retention

1424
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,240
how long does that need to be stored and

1425
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,880
how can that be deleted after that

1426
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,859
period of time is over there in limited

1427
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,990
data sharing I think actually kind of in

1428
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,850
contrast to what was being said earlier

1429
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,169
the fact that these systems don't talk

1430
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,569
to each other for me is kind of

1431
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:04,270
reassuring sometimes I think it's fine

1432
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:07,600
that they they don't always share all of

1433
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:10,180
the data all over time and then yeah I

1434
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,009
guess building in kind of recognizing

1435
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,839
the amount of power that we have in even

1436
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,250
talking about kind of designing these

1437
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,950
systems and implementing these systems

1438
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,770
and instead creating ways kind of as

1439
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,629
Andrea was saying to not just to do more

1440
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:24,550
than kind of here in a feedback loop but

1441
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:27,880
to give that power to the people who are

1442
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:31,240
going to be within that system Andrew

1443
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:34,510
this this this a lot of work already

1444
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:37,600
being done in regards to the principles

1445
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:40,990
regards to identity in regards to data

1446
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,850
security but it goes back down to what

1447
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:45,640
is it in the interest of the individual

1448
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:47,080
and it's concerning like what what has

1449
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,810
happened on the 18 for April with with

1450
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,700
with the adoption by Parliament all

1451
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:55,060
these rules and regulations within

1452
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:57,279
within Europe because can somebody has

1453
00:59:55,060 --> 01:00:00,250
been discussed can somebody be forgotten

1454
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,560
like are the are the principles that we

1455
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,150
are so like including Europe is pushing

1456
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,830
for so much have they adopted them

1457
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:08,530
themselves within their own within their

1458
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:10,450
own guidelines so I don't know I don't I

1459
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:12,640
doubt it I think there's much more

1460
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:16,509
issues in regards to security regards

1461
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,339
control then what is maybe necessary if

1462
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,840
you look at the waffle nurse if you look

1463
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:22,060
at the specific purpose if you look at

1464
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:24,070
the accuracy the quality the ability for

1465
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:26,470
refugees and others to update their in

1466
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:29,470
their own information do who owns the

1467
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:31,839
data who owns the identity and I suppose

1468
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:33,279
it's a crux of it and if you're working

1469
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,220
for people if you're working for

1470
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,410
individual

1471
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,839
the individual has to own the data they

1472
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:40,520
have to elect when when it's the right

1473
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,220
for somebody else used to use that data

1474
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:47,030
and not be sold not be commercialized

1475
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,740
not be used for nefarious purposes thank

1476
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,720
you so much I think that is a wonderful

1477
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,160
statement to end this panel on and I

1478
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,350
would very much like to continue this

1479
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,620
discussion with you hopefully next year

1480
01:00:54,350 --> 01:01:00,259
and take cause incentive to do so I'd

1481
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,790
like to thank partners from VM said and

1482
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,200
Gi said for enabling this discussion

1483
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,730
