1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,180
okay so those online tuning in can also

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,940
hear us we're ready to start with

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,000
critical as existential the EU CSA

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,059
regulation and the future of Internet

5
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,920
Eli yakubovska from edry is going to

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,680
introduce the session and her speakers

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,500
and we're very much looking forward to

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,260
hearing about this topic

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,840
brilliant thank you so much and uh

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,060
really glad to have you all here joining

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,220
us for this panel as Andrea said

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,000
critical as existential the eu's child

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,460
sexual abuse regulation and the future

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,360
of the internet so not a small topic and

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,760
really looking forward to delving into

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,140
it today

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,020
I'm absolutely delighted to introduce

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,940
our three panelists

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,399
um who are going to help us explore the

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,780
topic from technical legal feminist and

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,940
political perspectives so trying to

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,300
really interrogate this complex

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,240
sensitive nuanced topic and so without

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,299
further Ado and please excuse my

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,280
attempts at pronouncing names correctly

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,979
we've got a heavily Germanic panel just

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,659
coincidentally

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,780
um so first of all

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,840
who is the advocacy lead at Super lab if

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
you've not heard of them check them out

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
they're an incredible feminist Tech CSO

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,560
that works to create more Equitable

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,619
digital Futures and Corona is Super's

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,979
expert on feminist Tech policy

35
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,759
next up we have Alina eichstat who is

36
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,100
the spokesperson of Europe's biggest

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
hacker organization the chaos computer

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,340
club or CCC she's a computer scientist

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,119
working in I.T security and she leads on

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,060
policy Endeavors at the EU level and

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,159
always very busy

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
and last but by no means least I'd like

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,399
to introduce MEP Dr Patrick Breyer who

44
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,579
is the lead MEP on the CSA regulation

45
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,580
for the greens group as well as a former

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,700
judge and a civil rights activist and an

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,040
extremely litigious person which for

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
which we are very grateful you might

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,239
notice that he is not Brendan van

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,580
alsinoy from the European data

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,680
protection supervisor unfortunately

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,900
Brendan is no longer able to join us

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,959
today but really to be able to get

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,660
Patrick at such short notice is a really

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,239
excellent opportunity so we're really

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,220
grateful that you could join us and and

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,020
I said I'll be sympathetic to Patrick

58
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,900
because he's had all of a couple of

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,599
hours to get up to speed with with our

60
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,400
panel today

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
um and then I am the moderator for this

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,260
panel as you've probably already guessed

63
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,440
um I'm Ella yakubovska and I work as a

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,440
senior policy advisor at edree where I

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,500
focus on the CSA regulation but also

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,840
facial recognition and Biometrics and a

67
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,480
bid on law enforcement databases as well

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,420
and by background I'm trained as a

69
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,920
sociologist of technology and Society

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,159
so quickly just to frame this this uh

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,440
this debate and this law that we are

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,360
talking about as well as going more

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,000
broadly into kind of existential

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,459
questions about the internet

75
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,200
um what we're discussing is the

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,900
regulation laying down rules to prevent

77
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,080
and combat child sexual abuse but I'll

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,659
refer to that law as the CSA regulation

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,519
or Cesar

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
and it is a proposed law and that's come

81
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,099
forward from the European commission so

82
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,220
we're looking at several years until it

83
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,860
comes into Force if at all hopefully not

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,440
as you will you will come to hear

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
um why we don't want it to come into

86
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,500
Force

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,560
and critically although the title of the

88
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,540
law very much frames it as being about

89
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,959
prevention of abuse and Child Protection

90
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,000
um Eddie has been working on this as a

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,060
network for for quite a while and really

92
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,799
for us it's very clear that this is a

93
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,500
piece of online regulation it's looking

94
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,640
at

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
the online element of these crimes it's

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
not about it's not a child Perfection

97
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,699
protection and prevention of abuse law

98
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,079
but there's an added tension about

99
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,080
whether really it is and should be an

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,419
online regulation a piece of Internet

101
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,300
regulation or whether it's actually a

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,180
law enforcement proposal

103
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,340
um the lead MEP working on this will

104
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,139
tell you that it's very much about

105
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,259
online regulation but if you look to the

106
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,220
council

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,440
um which is the group of representatives

108
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,919
from every EU member States government

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,840
you'll see that it is former police

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,419
officers in the law enforcement working

111
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,780
party that are entirely responsible for

112
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,120
negotiating this proposal on behalf of

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,460
their countries and many of them have

114
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,100
backgrounds in home Affairs and internal

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,400
security so even within this law that

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,139
we've got on the table there's a bit of

117
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,900
an existential crisis about what it

118
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,540
actually is and what it's got rules are

119
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,300
and how it's going to achieve them

120
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,360
and I also want to make a distinction if

121
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,940
you've seen any of edgery's analysis of

122
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,039
this law you'll have seen that we call

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,080
for it to be completely withdrawn and

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,020
that we are deeply deeply critical of it

125
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,600
that's because of the methods that this

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,479
law puts forward we agree that the goals

127
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,400
Child Protection online is very

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,860
important and I wish it would go without

129
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,199
saying that we believe that but some of

130
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,300
the criticisms that get leveled on this

131
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,780
highly politicized topic accuse those of

132
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,960
us that that oppose it of not caring and

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,419
actually what we have to say is deeply

134
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,699
rooted in the fact that we don't think

135
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,100
it's the right thing for young people we

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,960
don't think it's going to lead to the

137
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,380
sort of safe secure internet for adults

138
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,840
and children alike

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,699
and we're not the only ones that have

140
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,759
been leveling criticisms at this law

141
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,280
from data protection authorities

142
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,560
politicians several National parliaments

143
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,840
um and kind of technologists and cyber

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
Security Experts as well as kind of

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,580
legal experts around the world have

146
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,220
raised huge concerns of mass

147
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,039
surveillance of upload filters of

148
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,280
breaking encryption so there's a lot on

149
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
the table for this law and that's why we

150
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
thought when we're thinking about

151
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,300
digital and crisis that this is a really

152
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,639
good topic to interrogate

153
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,979
but we're also in this panel gonna try

154
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,780
and move a little bit beyond just

155
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,340
critiquing

156
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,259
um which is very important and very much

157
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,720
has its place um but also thinking about

158
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,120
the sort of Internet that we do want to

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,100
see and trying to bring in some

160
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,380
intersectional feminist and social

161
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,660
justice perspectives to really

162
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,360
understand or we won't understand it in

163
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,800
in less than an hour and a half but you

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,660
know to to get through some of the

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,639
themes that are really really important

166
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,419
to be able to have an evidence-based and

167
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,880
you know proper assessment of this

168
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,380
proposal

169
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,600
so before I'm going to hand over to our

170
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,460
wonderful speakers I do just want to say

171
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,259
that we're really hoping this can be

172
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,080
quite an interactive session so I will

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
be opening up at several points for

174
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,180
audience interjections or questions so

175
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,280
please have a think about what you might

176
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
want to know from our panelists and if

177
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
you're following online or in the room

178
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,599
please do jump on social media it's

179
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,940
hashtag

180
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,620
privacycamp23 and you can find all of us

181
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,620
on Twitter and many of us on Mastodon as

182
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,199
well so please do jump in there as well

183
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,560
with what you're thinking

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,340
okay so turning to our panelists

185
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,800
I want to start off by thinking broadly

186
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,440
we're here around the theme of critical

187
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,340
and digital so in a few words in really

188
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,460
whatever sense you would like what do

189
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,740
the ideas of critical and digital mean

190
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,560
to you and the work that you do and I'm

191
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,099
going to start with Patrick if I may

192
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,460
critical thinking is really the basis of

193
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,620
our work in the pirate party and one of

194
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,720
the reasons why the the party has been

195
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,660
founded to bring a critical thinking to

196
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,660
politics but in the digital era that

197
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,780
means you need to understand the

198
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,539
um the the opportunities but also the

199
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,479
limits of technology

200
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,399
that is already very difficult for many

201
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,979
to understand because digital is a kind

202
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,979
of hype Topic in the political sphere

203
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,820
everyone loves digital everyone loves Ai

204
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,519
and we need to become world leaders and

205
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,040
we need to use all opportunities and be

206
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,500
better than everyone else so that's very

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,339
easy to say from a very simplistic

208
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,700
perspective but to actually

209
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,120
understand that it's about quality that

210
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,839
it's about values and rights and that

211
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,740
it's about limits of of Technology this

212
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,260
requires has a lot of knowledge and

213
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,459
understanding and I'm afraid a lot of

214
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,880
Education also in the political sphere

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,420
thank you and Alina what about you

216
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,980
yeah I mean personally I think a lot

217
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,459
about technology and Society but from

218
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,640
the perspective of the ks Computer Club

219
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,920
from whom of you might not know us we

220
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,620
are already like 42 years old so we've

221
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,980
been in this field for quite a long time

222
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,060
and with regards to critical and digital

223
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,580
it's really interesting how our first

224
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,459
text which is the two vertex T when the

225
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,519
ks Computer Club was founded is still

226
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,320
really true and I think equally

227
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,920
important and this Mission and

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,019
self-perception is deeply imprinted in

229
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,860
our work and with the belief that

230
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,160
computers can and should be used

231
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,060
to do good and to help people but at the

232
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,760
same time to

233
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,700
free information mistrust authorities

234
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,880
and also support decentralized systems

235
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,040
and

236
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,440
[Music]

237
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,160
um

238
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,760
use public data but also protect private

239
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,000
data which I think is crucial especially

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,580
in those times of Crisis we have so

241
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,180
secure information but not at least also

242
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,820
the whole thing we like to use in our

243
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,399
community is be excellent to each other

244
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,399
and this comes with education and how to

245
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,339
behave in the digital community and also

246
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,579
to moderate this community and I think

247
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,079
this is a really

248
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,320
crucial term in this matter

249
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
thank you and yeah I think what I'm

250
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,260
picking up from maybe a little bit from

251
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,420
you and Patrick is this idea that being

252
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,519
critical of the digital also means

253
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,620
sometimes saying no to the digital and

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,440
drawing our red lines for realizing when

255
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
digital Solutions are not the right kind

256
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,880
of solutions to the problems that we're

257
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,980
tackling which is very pertinent when

258
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,860
talking about the CSA regulation and

259
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,839
then last but not least Corona what

260
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,399
about you and your work at Super lab

261
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,680
um

262
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,100
thank you so much Patrick

263
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,720
um so I personally do come from a social

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,540
policy background and in that field

265
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,000
digital policy is often seen as a very

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
separate issue a technical one may be an

267
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,459
economic one but not a societal one and

268
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,620
I think all of us here do agree that

269
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,980
that's a wrong take because Tech policy

270
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,680
is a social policy I mean as we see with

271
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,620
the CSA regulation often it's an

272
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,260
extension of already existence issues

273
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,680
and it's aggravated by technology Yeah

274
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,779
by Tech

275
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,279
and therefore from like a feminist

276
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,500
perspective I would say that we should

277
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,300
apply the same scrutiny we apply to

278
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,240
social policy to Tech policy and ask

279
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,940
questions on power structures like who

280
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,720
is Tech made for and by whom who are the

281
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,120
most like negatively affected people by

282
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,279
Tech how can we Center them and make

283
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,779
sure that Solutions are working for

284
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,519
everyone and lastly what you already

285
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,560
mentioned do we need a technological

286
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,519
solution to the issues we have maybe low

287
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,899
Tech or no Tech is a better answer

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
thank you okay so hopefully our

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,079
panelists are a little bit warmed up by

290
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,019
that so getting more into the weighty

291
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,779
questions of course the other theme of

292
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,320
privacy camp this year is Crisis and for

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,019
edry we have been very clear that the

294
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,560
CSA regulation could be a crisis for the

295
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,019
internet as we know it so I wanted to

296
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,240
ask each of our panelists in turn to

297
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,399
think about some of the elements within

298
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,680
this legislation this CSA regulation

299
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,079
that they see as being a potential

300
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,660
crisis and what the implications of that

301
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,720
might be so Elena if I could turn to you

302
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,040
first

303
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,060
yeah I think what we are seeing with the

304
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,820
Cesar regulation is something really

305
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,459
common that we've have seen in the last

306
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,620
years is another attack on end-to-end

307
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,620
encrypted communication

308
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,100
but also at private and secure

309
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,160
communication because especially for

310
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,480
young people they probably

311
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,200
think that they can communicate on a

312
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,180
trustworthy and private Channel even

313
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
though it's not end-to-end encrypted and

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,980
I think this is a really important point

315
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,040
that private communication needs to stay

316
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,620
private so this is one Element this is

317
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,519
really crucial in the sisa but another

318
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,519
thing this is that is threatening the

319
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,480
whole way the internet works is the term

320
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,500
of blocking orders so the idea that

321
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,480
certain

322
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,519
like the commission believes that

323
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,279
certain URLs can be blocked but in

324
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,360
reality

325
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,899
um we know that that will lead to

326
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,060
blocking in general so

327
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,360
um in the domain name system and this is

328
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,180
attacking the root of the internet

329
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,000
infrastructure and we have seen those

330
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,620
blocks

331
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,100
um to lead to some overblocking and also

332
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,320
so fundamental rights and violations

333
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,440
which is highly problematic and the last

334
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,740
point I would like to make is the whole

335
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,500
theme around age verification when

336
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,420
talking about age verification we

337
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,060
usually talk about

338
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,279
biometric technology used to create age

339
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,860
verification and anonymity in the

340
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,959
internet on the internet but another

341
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,680
problem at the Cesar is that it attacks

342
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,459
the whole open source Universe because

343
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,100
once age verification needs to be

344
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,360
included

345
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,920
into the whole process of Downing

346
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,019
loading software freely

347
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,360
um our open source repositories

348
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,699
are in a really

349
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,740
yeah uncertain legal Fields because how

350
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,959
open source usually works is like it's

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,180
highly decentralized they don't track

352
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,579
any data about their users they don't

353
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,279
even know what you download because you

354
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,440
can

355
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,699
choose your instance where you download

356
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,760
your software and and forcing age

357
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,820
verification on those systems would mean

358
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,519
that you strip it of all the

359
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,760
decentralized aspects that you will

360
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,339
overload those people who are doing

361
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,980
development of Open Source software on a

362
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,380
volunteer basis

363
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,800
um with the prob issues of risk

364
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,440
assessing their software reassessing

365
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,620
their software and also building in a

366
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,800
lot of tracking into all the open source

367
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,860
Universe which would be

368
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
yeah destroying the whole idea we have

369
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,880
there so this is a point that attacks

370
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,220
the route and also we all have to

371
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,860
remember that a lot of parts of the

372
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,540
internet are based on open source

373
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,759
infrastructure So This is highly

374
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,980
critical to them

375
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,740
okay so what I'm hearing is that for

376
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,199
people the community that believes in an

377
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,560
open internet in a space of you know a

378
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,019
free expression and respect for privacy

379
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,779
and a secure infrastructure there's a

380
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,420
lot in this proposal that seems to to

381
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,839
put it mildly technically infeasible you

382
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,579
mentioned encryption and I know that's

383
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,679
been one of the big things we hear a lot

384
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,839
about in relation to this law

385
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,959
um a lot from the technology Community

386
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,459
criticize and have really deeply

387
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,799
concerned about the potential impacts on

388
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,299
encryption

389
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,059
um but also some people kind of dismiss

390
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,280
that and say no there's no risk to

391
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,260
encryption could you maybe you know

392
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,939
having the benefit of your amazing

393
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,740
technical expertise just give us a bit

394
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,640
more

395
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
um of an insight into what the risk is

396
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
to encryption and why that matters

397
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,919
um yeah thank you um that's a really

398
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,160
good question actually so there's this

399
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,799
belief especially from a lawmaker's

400
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,460
perspective often that we can undermine

401
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,480
encrypted Communication in a secure way

402
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
and this is a really really wrong

403
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
perception and that will never be

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,740
possible

405
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,480
um let me explain why

406
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,120
so the whole idea of end-to-end

407
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,020
encrypted communication is that the two

408
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,299
parties for example if I'm sending a

409
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,059
message um to Ella we are in total

410
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,840
control of who will read this message in

411
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,100
this case just Ella and me and

412
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,980
the engine encryption makes sure that

413
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,860
it's only readable to both parties of

414
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,580
the communication and what what was

415
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,679
brought to the table when we discussed

416
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,600
the sisa regulation is so-called

417
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,360
client-side scanning and the idea of

418
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,080
client-side scanning is that the content

419
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,340
is being screened before it is encrypted

420
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,340
so some people would argument it's not

421
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,039
breaking encryption but I would always

422
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
like to state that encryption and

423
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,380
especially end-to-end encryption is a

424
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,780
rather binary thing so either you have

425
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,039
it or you don't and no matter at which

426
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,400
spots you poke into the encryption or

427
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,919
enter encrypted process you strip away

428
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,620
the whole idea of trustworthy

429
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,940
Communication in this case so

430
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,820
the whole narrative we see with the sisa

431
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,940
regulation is really really dangerous

432
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,760
and and dangerous trustworthy

433
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,100
communication for everyone

434
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,840
brilliant thank you

435
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,480
okay Karina what about you what uh some

436
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,460
of the elements of Crisis that you see

437
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,980
potentially coming out of this law

438
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,900
yeah we had super really see the topic

439
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,820
of content moderation to be a big issue

440
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,160
of the Cesar regulation as well because

441
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,980
in the regulation the idea of how the

442
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,260
abuse material is going to be found is

443
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,240
Tech neutral so the idea is that some

444
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,299
non-existent algorithm will detect Cesar

445
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,580
and pass it on to some non-existing EU

446
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,799
institution

447
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,539
but what we've learned from our current

448
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,700
work with Quantum moderators is that the

449
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,919
tech employed already by companies like

450
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,880
meta for example is not good enough yet

451
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,460
so in practice Quantum moderation of all

452
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,000
of this material will be done by people

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,320
um and what Quantum moderators have

454
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,140
already told us is that in nine out of

455
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,900
10 cases like things are automatically

456
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,200
flagged by algorithms are it's just bad

457
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,059
content it's not really it's not really

458
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,980
there's nothing in there that is

459
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,740
actually harmful so they have insights

460
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,059
into really private conversations

461
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,640
intimate pictures with disease of

462
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,240
Regulation most likely this will include

463
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,640
uh yeah nudes for example or even naked

464
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,620
children playing at the beach like

465
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,640
they're just family vacation pictures or

466
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,559
sexting like all of these very private

467
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,600
things that you don't want some counter

468
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,140
moderator like read from USC from you

469
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,320
um and secondly those Quantum moderators

470
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,940
already have really terrible working

471
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,460
conditions so it's also like a very big

472
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,620
like offline like social policy labor

473
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,620
market issue they have very very little

474
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,539
to no training there's a huge

475
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,460
psychological impact of the work that

476
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
they do because they spend eight hours a

477
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,140
day often without breaks uh yeah

478
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,600
watching really terrible material uh

479
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,840
having very little psychological support

480
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,020
uh often they're badly unionized or not

481
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,480
don't have any Union support that's also

482
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,280
from those companies

483
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,740
um yeah movements to stop them from from

484
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,980
unionizing and the thing is this will

485
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,020
just be aggravated by the seaside

486
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,520
regulation because then those companies

487
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
will need more of those content

488
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
moderators that will have to see even

489
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,700
worse content and there's not really a

490
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,559
plan for the human industry that we have

491
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,159
then as well and we want to force more

492
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,960
people and not trained that I didn't

493
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,280
sign up for this like people in the

494
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
police force that work on Specialized

495
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
teams to read view all of this content

496
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,679
so that's a huge question we should ask

497
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,539
ourselves as well

498
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,280
absolutely and I think we were we were

499
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,900
checking in earlier and thinking about

500
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,120
how we've heard from some of the the

501
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,919
companies that would have these sorts of

502
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,260
obligations under this new law how they

503
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,820
don't want to be responsible for

504
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,100
deciding what constitutes child sexual

505
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,020
abuse material or not when they're not

506
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,640
equipped for that

507
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,500
um and you know what you're going to see

508
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,980
as a result of that is an over

509
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,640
um reporting uh sending huge volumes of

510
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
material because we know these

511
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,179
Technologies are deeply flawed and

512
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,760
sending to the EU Center and on to law

513
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,400
enforcement for review and maybe to give

514
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,380
one kind of quite chilling example I

515
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,000
think that's come up in the work that

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,400
we've been doing as the edgery network I

517
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,260
realized at the beginning I forgot to to

518
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,940
give our little blurb about who we are

519
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,580
but we're a network of I think around 47

520
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,820
digital rights digital human rights

521
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,940
groups working on a really wide range of

522
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,280
digital rights topics and some of our

523
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,620
partners in Ireland the digital rights

524
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,100
Ireland and ICC Irish Council for civil

525
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,140
civil liberties

526
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,299
have done an investigation and actually

527
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:03,539
revealed that a huge number of the

528
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,880
reports in the last few years that made

529
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,640
it to the Irish police were confirmed to

530
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
be completely innocent people there were

531
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
hundreds and hundreds of examples of

532
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,860
adults consensually sharing intimate

533
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,740
images with their partners for example a

534
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,840
lot of people whose kids were playing on

535
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,640
a beach or in the bath

536
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,520
and even once those images had been

537
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,640
confirmed to be completely innocent what

538
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,320
they discovered was happening is that

539
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,840
the police were retaining a lot of

540
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,179
really personal data on these people who

541
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,880
had been cleared and holding on to it

542
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,360
this really sensitive information in a

543
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,860
way that suggested that these people

544
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,020
were linked to this really severe

545
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,179
serious crime of child sexual abuse and

546
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,980
and stories are starting to come out of

547
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,320
the harms of when people are falsely

548
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,539
accused with starting to hear some some

549
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,000
really awful ways in which people's

550
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,179
lives can be absolutely destroyed so you

551
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,039
know it might seem like a bit of you

552
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,360
know technical

553
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
you know a technical issue but it's

554
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,640
really deeply deeply human and profound

555
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,280
and how it can impact people's lives

556
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,559
uh so Patrick

557
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,120
um there's still I think a lot of CR

558
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,340
crisis elements in this proposal that

559
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,020
you could choose from to talk about so

560
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,220
maybe you could share some of your

561
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,320
insights about how you see it being a

562
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,440
crisis it's my take on why this uh chat

563
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,780
control proposal is a crisis for for

564
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,659
digital fundamental rights is because it

565
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,780
creates a totally new and unprecedented

566
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,559
level of mass surveillance on private

567
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,539
Communications what they've been doing

568
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,600
so far is basically applying Mass

569
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,200
surveillance to transnational

570
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,820
Communications and they've been for the

571
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,860
purpose of National Security and what

572
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,360
they're proposing now is to to screen

573
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,159
the content of all personal

574
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,980
Communications for anybody including

575
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,260
their own citizens and not for the

576
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,620
purpose of National Security but for a

577
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,539
fighting crime serious crime for sure

578
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,500
but um this is the so-called mandatory

579
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,620
detection orders so to to oblige

580
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,140
providers of of personal communication

581
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,000
services to use algorithms to

582
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
automatically look for

583
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,140
conspicuous content in private

584
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,059
Communications and then mostly

585
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,460
automatically

586
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,400
disclose these communications to an EU

587
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,220
agency and and possibly law enforcement

588
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,679
this is unprecedented it doesn't exist

589
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,960
anywhere in the world I think the system

590
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,419
most similar to it is what they have in

591
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,880
China where all chat services are

592
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
constantly scanning for terms that might

593
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,020
be critical of the regime or its leaders

594
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,600
so this is what we hear about China that

595
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,080
they use this kind of system on on their

596
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,559
own closed internet or on WeChat this is

597
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,440
a kind of methods that is unheard of in

598
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,039
in the Free World so far

599
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,419
for one thing because it creates a

600
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,620
precedent if you uh follow that logic

601
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,460
that the mere risk that some private

602
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,039
space could be abused for criminal

603
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,400
activity is sufficient for you to place

604
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,039
it under surveillance that means that

605
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:29,400
they can scan for anything for any

606
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,020
criminal Behavior they can even start

607
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,900
looking for copyright infringements for

608
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,179
defamation

609
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:39,600
for harmful content they could next uh

610
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,940
move to to search your personal devices

611
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,220
not only what's being communicated but

612
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,320
also what's on in your devices

613
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,679
themselves they could move on to scan

614
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
letters this is like post office opening

615
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,080
or letters and screening them right they

616
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,980
could move on to installing equipment in

617
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,840
your in your apartments because of

618
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,400
course apartments are also private

619
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,140
spaces that are being accused

620
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,179
occasionally and that's why they keep

621
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,919
telling us you know this chat control if

622
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,620
it helps only one child it's it's it's

623
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,380
worth it but if you think about it and

624
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,539
that's the first impetus that one has of

625
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,159
course if this is about protecting

626
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,419
children and that's why it's so um

627
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,760
uh clever but also treacherous to choose

628
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,460
this opening door to open up for this

629
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,380
method to choose Child Protection

630
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,539
because this is what will most likely

631
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:33,240
prompt people to to agree to it but if

632
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,100
you think about it

633
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,880
um it is a nationalist and authoritarian

634
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,760
parties that call for the reintroduction

635
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,340
of death penalty for

636
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,460
um child sexual offenders

637
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,380
they call for torture on this basis to

638
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,820
save children we've had a debate in

639
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,880
Germany about that a few years ago so

640
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,159
um if you're willing to do so much for

641
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,960
every bit of what might be an additional

642
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,840
protection you are basically waving

643
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,360
fundamental rights and the idea of trust

644
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
and of of

645
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,880
a society that relies on the principle

646
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,740
of of trusting each other rather than

647
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,039
General uh distrust and and mass

648
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,400
surveillance and so that's why it opens

649
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,580
a door and and erodes and and results in

650
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,100
the collapse of the very concept of

651
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,799
fundamental rights if you allow that

652
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,460
logic to take place so in my opinion

653
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,760
of course it's possible that by randomly

654
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,460
searching any private spaces you will

655
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,520
find some crimes for sure so if you

656
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
randomly rate any Apartments you'll

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,700
occasionally find a crime that's for

658
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,000
sure but I to my conviction this does

659
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,340
not justify the the occasional random

660
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,140
detection of a crime does not justify

661
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,900
giving up the concept of private spaces

662
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,679
because it is so much more beneficial to

663
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,260
our society than what we could gain by

664
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,220
those occasional uh investigative

665
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,260
successes we need these private spaces

666
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,900
victims and need these spaces minorities

667
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,200
need them children need them people in

668
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
need of

669
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,840
of help and support need these protected

670
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,679
and safe spaces and we can't sacrifice

671
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,200
this this would actually harm children

672
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,779
much more than it would help them but to

673
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,419
explain this is so difficult and

674
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:33,179
um we we are not not getting way far

675
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,000
enough even to trigger a public debate

676
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,899
at all throughout Europe

677
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,720
we are fighting and struggling to to

678
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,000
explain this and I can only hope that in

679
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,399
the end it won't be up to the courts to

680
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,860
have the difficult tasks of of trying to

681
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,220
to fix that and defend our fundamental

682
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,140
rights this should be for all of us to

683
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,940
do this should be for politics to do

684
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,919
it's not only a job for courts

685
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,899
fundamental rights are only worth as

686
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,200
much as we are willing to defend them

687
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,179
yeah that's a very sobering thought

688
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,220
thank you Patrick and maybe just to

689
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,020
build a little bit on that we have

690
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,659
spoken with with quite a few parents and

691
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,640
children's rights experts about this

692
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
idea of how under this proposal young

693
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,740
people's sexual self-expression could be

694
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,279
really harmed what we could see is that

695
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,980
every intimate image that is sent by a

696
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,500
teenager consensually to their partner

697
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
would be systematically forwarded to

698
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,860
platform moderators and then on to law

699
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,320
enforcement and in some EU countries

700
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,240
there's actually a legal obligation on

701
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,460
those law enforcement agents to then go

702
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,399
and investigate into that so you know

703
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,020
really you know these parents we've been

704
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,880
speaking with these child rights experts

705
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,120
questioning is that really the sort of

706
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,159
Internet space that we want our young

707
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,080
people going to be safer when they're

708
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,899
nude images which realistically a lot of

709
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,380
teenagers are sending and in six I

710
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,760
believe EU countries it is

711
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,580
decriminalized for young people of

712
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,320
certain ages to send those those

713
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,600
intimate images as long as it's fully

714
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,059
within their consent and control and to

715
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,320
their partner of course we're not

716
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,480
talking about the onward sharing without

717
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,760
their consent that's absolutely not okay

718
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,059
but the the genuine genuine digital

719
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,399
element of of sexual development and

720
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,799
sexual self-expression that's especially

721
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,779
pertinent when you're thinking of queer

722
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,059
young people as well

723
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,220
so really a lot of Dimensions there we

724
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,600
have you know whether this will actually

725
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,700
help young people how it could destroy

726
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,740
private spaces

727
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,080
um the risk to content moderators and

728
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,120
the infallibility there

729
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,159
um and technically speaking as well are

730
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,299
really

731
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,880
badly formulated proposal I think I'm

732
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,980
happy to go as far as saying that

733
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,679
I also want to recognize that in the

734
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,539
audience today we have a lot of people

735
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,520
who are working on this file and who are

736
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,580
expert on on various elements of it so I

737
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,220
wanted to invite you here today if any

738
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,200
of you would like to share other

739
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,240
dimensions of this law that we haven't

740
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,240
touched on yet to to say a few words to

741
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,340
help inform the rest of us about other

742
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,679
ways that we could be seeing a crisis

743
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
when it comes to this law

744
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,260
yeah fantastic okay I'll bring you my

745
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,000
mic

746
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,679
and you're very welcome to introduce

747
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,940
yourself if you'd like to but no

748
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,860
obligation thank

749
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,380
you hello everyone my name is it and I

750
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,480
am from the European sex workers rights

751
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,299
Alliance we are an organization

752
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,880
operating in Europe and Central Asia

753
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,340
trying to defend sex workers rights from

754
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,440
different perspectives and one of the

755
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,940
concerning regulation at the moment

756
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,419
proposed for us as well this CC

757
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,440
CC regulation and from sex Works

758
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,059
perspective like we are really worried

759
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,779
because the privacy in sex workers life

760
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,340
it's kind of acts as a barrier

761
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,580
protective barrier from criminalization

762
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,220
and sex work stigma sex workers are

763
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,880
already coming to contact with police

764
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,740
constantly which is the one of the main

765
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,380
perpetrator of violence against sex

766
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,340
workers

767
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,519
and sex work is criminalized in many

768
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,919
countries in several ways

769
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,960
and sex workers are mothers you know

770
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,539
they have kids to look after and they

771
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,480
are often migrants and you know they are

772
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,080
in danger of deportation

773
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,600
so there are lots of things that make

774
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,299
sex workers vulnerable to uh privacy

775
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,960
violations it can really hurt them

776
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,640
significantly and we are really worried

777
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,940
about this uh you know proposal because

778
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,440
it's

779
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,519
like at the moment in Europe lots of sex

780
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,600
work is

781
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,679
um

782
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,140
kind of happening through internet so

783
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,360
sex workers are having lots of chats

784
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,980
with their clients that's just how they

785
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,200
find you know clients and how they

786
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,940
communicate and how they explain their

787
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,119
services and how this is how they send

788
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,560
nudes you know and uh even on a very you

789
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,080
know Niche level for example there's

790
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,540
this thing which is not only sex workers

791
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,460
are doing this but there's this you know

792
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,940
sexual uh fantasy thing that is called

793
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,399
you know age play for example you know

794
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,040
two consenting adults you know 30 years

795
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,199
old you know they can uh you know

796
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,119
communicate saying that you know or

797
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,739
treat me like a schoolgirl or something

798
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,739
like this so we see there are lots of

799
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,619
lots of ways that Communications of sex

800
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,460
workers can uh be interpreted as child

801
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,800
sexual abuse material and that could

802
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
really hurt sex workers which are one of

803
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,159
the most criminalized and stigmatized

804
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,339
community

805
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,000
thank you so much for sharing that and

806
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,680
absolutely we know that these systems

807
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,599
are not going to have the the context

808
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,700
the Nuance to be able to understand the

809
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,619
difference between that legitimate free

810
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,020
expression and what's you know actually

811
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,660
a crime I saw one other hand yeah thank

812
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,839
you

813
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,700
hi I'm Daniel Luther from access now um

814
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,500
so I'm not following this proposal

815
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,180
itself but what I find really

816
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,440
interesting is a general movement within

817
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,020
Mass surveillance towards Edge

818
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,260
processing as a sort of a way to dodge

819
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,020
the criticisms that we've built up so in

820
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,579
this case of client-side scanning we're

821
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,500
saying okay processing is happening on

822
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,900
device and that's being used as a way to

823
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,460
say but it's not my surveillance because

824
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,200
only the things that are being flagged

825
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,660
will then be you know seen by people we

826
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,579
see exactly the same thing in facial

827
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,800
recognition biometric surveillance where

828
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,780
there's a move to say okay we've got now

829
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,460
these cameras that actually do the

830
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,980
processing on edge so you know the watch

831
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,099
list is contained on the camera no one

832
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:01,020
sees it don't worry your data will be

833
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,599
deleted if there's no match and I think

834
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,060
it's like a very worrying you know we

835
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,920
see that the industry is very agile

836
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,920
against our criticisms that we focus on

837
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,599
specific things and then they move to

838
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,060
this and that's like a deeply doubling

839
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,099
movement so I wonder if you have any

840
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,220
thoughts on how the narrative that we

841
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,599
present against all these different

842
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,119
types of surveillance can push back

843
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,579
against this move to Edge processing

844
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,320
client-side scanning

845
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
um and just also you know obviously very

846
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,800
legitimate concerns were raised about

847
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,380
human moderators being involved in the

848
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,540
process here but by I'm very very

849
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,660
worried about the the technical the

850
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,119
automated scanning because this is just

851
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,460
really something that I think machine

852
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,200
learning cannot do and we're talking

853
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
about machine learning systems and I

854
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,079
think that's very difficult to

855
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,540
communicate because people say AI units

856
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,579
like oh yeah AI can do everything I can

857
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,440
talk to chat GPT and ask her all these

858
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,599
questions but it's very lucky look at a

859
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,339
machine Learning System it cannot

860
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:06,000
distinguish these types of of things and

861
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,480
you know how do we communicate these

862
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,540
very technical issues uh in a way that

863
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,460
yeah raises the alarm as it should

864
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,500
yeah maybe because you picked up the

865
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,380
point of machine learning and I think we

866
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,599
should like

867
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,240
draw a little picture of what the

868
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,220
commission thinks machine learning could

869
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,119
do

870
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,420
um and and what the reality is so this

871
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,280
whole regulation talks about the

872
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,060
detection of both known as well as

873
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,480
unknown content of child sexual abuse

874
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,820
but also about grooming which means

875
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,820
adults talking to Children grooming them

876
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,700
into some sexual practices sending

877
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,720
pictures ATC and when we look at

878
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,380
technology at the moment the false

879
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,280
positives are enormous and

880
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,940
um it is really easy to say yeah it will

881
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,040
take time and then we will have the

882
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,619
technology but the real reality is

883
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:16,619
really different because you always need

884
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:21,540
some kind of context to really detect

885
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,540
what is going on and especially in the

886
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,880
cases of grooming where we have natural

887
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,660
language processing yes they can detect

888
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,740
something but they won't detect the

889
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,040
context on the con of the conversation

890
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,060
and you always need to know at least how

891
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,460
old both of the parties communicating

892
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,880
which is each other are so this is a

893
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,079
problem and the on the other hand with

894
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,660
machine learning and AI we always have

895
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,040
the problem of discrimination so we have

896
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,520
seen a lot of cases where already

897
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,660
discriminated groups are being detected

898
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,540
because the data sets the machine

899
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,560
learning is trained on on our biased and

900
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,119
not

901
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,520
um set up properly so there's like a

902
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,060
whole line of problems leading to more

903
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,060
discrimination of certain groups when we

904
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,339
talk about all the machine learning

905
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,099
solution and they want to solve this

906
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,460
problem for us

907
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,980
yes if I can comment also because the

908
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,780
argument that you named basically you

909
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,060
have nothing to hide unless there is a

910
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,160
match you don't need to worry that's of

911
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,960
course something we hear in in politics

912
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,460
all the time and their argument

913
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,800
basically goes um will only be flagged

914
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,839
if there is a match and if ever there is

915
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,339
a false positive then there will be

916
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:51,960
somebody in the authority and the world

917
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,640
just discard it and nothing will happen

918
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,060
to you and so uh how do you explain to

919
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,020
people

920
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,780
um how much more this is

921
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,440
um this this mechanism first of all the

922
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,740
whole fact of having this in place has a

923
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,420
chilling effect on all private

924
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,280
Communications because you don't know

925
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,380
how exactly your device this function

926
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,079
works you you will not know whether some

927
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,240
content is being disclosed there is no

928
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,280
notification about it you don't know

929
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,839
what's in the hash database you don't

930
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,700
have access to the algorithms it's a

931
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,280
business a secret um how they work so it

932
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,260
has a massive chilling effect even

933
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,599
before anyone has even sent a message

934
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,180
some people May no longer use these

935
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,619
Services because they don't consider

936
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,020
them safe any longer and that's really

937
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,720
harmful for society but in order to

938
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,280
explain that to the more conservative

939
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,619
colleagues I think many of the arguments

940
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,000
that we've been discussing probably

941
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,800
don't don't work on them because they're

942
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,839
not so keen on on sexual

943
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,060
self-determination I think what might

944
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,980
work is on the one hand or what I'm

945
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,380
trying to explain on the one hand to say

946
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,599
this proposal is solutionism that really

947
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,079
intrudes in the in the family because

948
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,820
many of the aspects that you're trying

949
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,040
to deal with like childhood grooming is

950
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,339
something that a family should deal with

951
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:14,579
um if small children have access to the

952
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:15,720
internet there should be a certain

953
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,420
degree of parental control you should be

954
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,339
dealing with it within the family or

955
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,320
maybe with social workers but it's not

956
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,500
for the police to criminalize uh certain

957
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,859
activities and in Germany in fact 50 of

958
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,839
the investigations for possession of

959
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,960
child sexual exploitation material

960
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,720
targets minors so hardly anyone knows

961
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,060
about this at this proposal results in

962
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,800
the criminalization of children so

963
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
that's an angle that might work because

964
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,099
conservatives are very very

965
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,980
family-minded and another angle that I

966
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,480
try to use is

967
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,020
this is really totally ineffective you

968
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,180
can see on those platforms and networks

969
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,980
that use the chat control algorithms

970
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,480
already and have used them for years

971
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:02,060
such as meta such as gmails using it

972
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,680
Microsoft's

973
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
systems are using them you can see there

974
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,920
that the number of reports are going up

975
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,280
so obviously even with that mass

976
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,560
surveillance in place you keep having

977
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,740
more and more material

978
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,119
being shared on those networks it's

979
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,119
clearly ineffective it doesn't work and

980
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,579
what would really work instead and there

981
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,079
are several components that are missing

982
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,260
and the proposal is for one thing there

983
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,200
is no obligation for platforms to

984
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,780
immediately take down illegal material

985
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,960
once they have actual knowledge of it

986
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,540
commission is officially arguing that

987
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,960
this could result to false positives and

988
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,619
that this could result in

989
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:48,420
impinging on ongoing investigations

990
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,300
so that's like saying um if somebody has

991
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,820
been hurt by a criminal you need to keep

992
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,200
them bleeding because you need to

993
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,660
preserve evidence right so that's an

994
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,040
amazing

995
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
um thing to say

996
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,460
platforms are under no obligation to

997
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,200
take down material

998
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,000
um also law enforcement is under no

999
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,460
obligation to report known uh URLs for

1000
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,000
uh removal by the hosters and we know

1001
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,240
and europol is saying that that the way

1002
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,180
that the the professional criminals the

1003
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,220
the people who create this material who

1004
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,800
abuse children are operating is normally

1005
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
they upload encrypted archives and so

1006
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,540
for the encrypted archives no scanner

1007
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,460
will work because you can't find hashes

1008
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,880
in encrypted material and they will also

1009
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,619
not find the links pointing to those

1010
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,460
encrypted archives and therefore it is

1011
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,560
all the worst that there is no

1012
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,800
obligation even to remove material we

1013
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,359
know from a German case where a whole

1014
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,700
child porn ring has been busted that

1015
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,440
they simply didn't notify the hosters

1016
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,780
and terabytes and terabytes of material

1017
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,359
continued circulating long after

1018
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,900
the this houses had been searched which

1019
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,339
is really catastrophe and commission

1020
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,260
doesn't want to change that they're not

1021
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,119
addressing the the situation in law

1022
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,060
enforcement who are completely flooded

1023
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,220
with alarms and not dealing with with

1024
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,440
the reports professionally they're not

1025
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,720
dealing with prevention

1026
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,180
um so much of this child sexual abuse

1027
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,060
goes undetected and it's never even

1028
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,640
known to to authorities and it would be

1029
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,640
so important to address prevention where

1030
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,400
abuse is taking place which is mostly by

1031
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,079
a person close to the child by

1032
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,839
caregivers Etc nothing about that and

1033
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,599
and the proposals and so this is what

1034
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm trying to tell conservatives I don't

1035
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,380
know if it works

1036
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,300
yeah it's a tough one but I think you're

1037
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,740
really hitting at the heart of it there

1038
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,300
about you know when you look at the

1039
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,400
statistics and the evidence of this

1040
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,680
problem and of the solutions that are

1041
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,540
going to be the most effective and that

1042
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,060
are proven already this proposal is not

1043
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,160
responding to that you speak to the

1044
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,079
child protection hotlines working in

1045
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,480
most EU countries and they say quick

1046
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,819
removal of content from the Internet is

1047
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:07,380
the number one thing we can do to

1048
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,540
protect victims whereas this proposal

1049
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,780
actually is lengthening that uh several

1050
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,640
times over the amount of time it takes

1051
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,160
to remove content from the internet you

1052
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,839
mentioned about the fact that the crime

1053
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,140
is is mostly perpetuated by people known

1054
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,000
to the child I think the latest

1055
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,740
statistic is still that that's in about

1056
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,500
80 percent of cases so of course there

1057
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,839
is an online issue but the real root of

1058
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,640
the problem is this deeply social

1059
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,280
problem that technology is not going to

1060
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,740
help us to be able to tackle

1061
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,020
but moving on maybe to a little bit more

1062
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,700
more positively and thinking about

1063
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,700
alternative digital futures

1064
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,500
I want to think about how you know a lot

1065
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,599
of things from history that have been

1066
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,780
seen as radical have now become pretty

1067
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,000
much taken for granted things around

1068
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,880
workers rights having having weekends

1069
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
was a very radical thing when when we

1070
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,680
first got weekends but also around

1071
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,140
social racial and gender justice

1072
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,319
movements even the eu's data protection

1073
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,780
laws have been criticized as being too

1074
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,819
radical but I think this idea of

1075
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,819
radicality and and also mainstreaming

1076
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:16,740
what has seemed radical can really help

1077
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,220
us to to challenge power structures and

1078
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,220
and push for more transformative visions

1079
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,400
and in the context of the CSA regulation

1080
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,619
I think that's really really pertinent

1081
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,140
because the World Health organizer thank

1082
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,760
you the World Health Organization

1083
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,460
reminds us that the crime of child

1084
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,520
sexual abuse is really deeply linked to

1085
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,160
gender inequality and the structural

1086
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,500
disempowerment of women and girls and if

1087
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,839
you don't tackle that no other sort of

1088
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,819
measures are really going to be able to

1089
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,280
be effective

1090
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,319
so for our speakers and we're going to

1091
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,480
go to Karina first could you tell us a

1092
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,700
little bit about what for you and for

1093
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,579
super lab is a vision of a rights

1094
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,339
respecting and just internet

1095
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,480
foreign

1096
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,520
yeah thanks so much Ella

1097
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,980
um yeah I'm gonna pull back a little I

1098
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,500
think and go back a bit more on the meta

1099
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,119
level and I'm very glad that I'll call

1100
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,400
it some F's are here and mentioned like

1101
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,140
the rights of sex workers for example

1102
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,300
because as I said before like a feminist

1103
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,980
approach is always looking at Power

1104
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,200
structures and seeing also how those

1105
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,819
power structures affect the most

1106
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,520
marginalized so when it comes to

1107
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,380
legislation we really have to think

1108
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,700
about

1109
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,400
um yeah how are we even approaching this

1110
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,640
so for example CSA regulation if it

1111
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,460
passes the way it it's now written or

1112
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,859
proposed at least uh has will have a

1113
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,740
global impact like GPR had like the way

1114
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,839
that we're doing uh legislation on the

1115
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,060
internet in the EU has Global impact

1116
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:51,000
even though we don't talk to the global

1117
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
majority so there we also need to think

1118
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,099
about if we really want a rights respect

1119
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:58,140
on Internet it's not just for us in the

1120
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,480
EU or maybe in the US but it's for the

1121
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,920
whole world because we have this Global

1122
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,900
impact so we need to also get take that

1123
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,760
into account and I know this is really

1124
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,280
like meta level thinking but really we

1125
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,920
need to rethink our stakeholder

1126
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,020
consultations who do you talk to who do

1127
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,180
we make policy for who's most

1128
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,780
marginalized as you said sex workers is

1129
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,220
often are often the ones that are

1130
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,480
blowing the whistles when it comes to

1131
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,339
these kind of issues because they are

1132
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,920
the first that are affected by this so

1133
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,099
thank you for your intervention here

1134
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,900
um and the second point I wanted to make

1135
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,660
is what you already mentioned Patrick is

1136
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,280
the point of so many people are saying

1137
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,960
oh this doesn't concern me I'm not doing

1138
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,900
anything illegal here so read my private

1139
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,180
communication I don't care

1140
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,240
the issue is that as we know learn as

1141
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,859
with all I think a Korean as you always

1142
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:49,440
can see uh online privacy is like a

1143
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,960
fundamental right and weakening that

1144
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,319
will lead to like much further like Mass

1145
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,420
surveillance on other topics talk about

1146
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,700
gender issues for example we are seeing

1147
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,400
uh the rollback of reproductive rights

1148
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,140
for example in Hungary and especially

1149
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,579
Poland uh do we want uh yeah the Polish

1150
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,200
authorities being able to screen

1151
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,020
conversations for women taking their

1152
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,180
rights for like on their over their own

1153
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,200
bodies so we have to get away from the

1154
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,480
whole idea of online privacy is an

1155
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,020
individual issue that may be very well

1156
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,540
informed and their interested nerds can

1157
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,339
do is something that is the right for

1158
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:30,780
everyone that's interested for everyone

1159
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,640
and it's not something you have to

1160
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,980
personally ensure but that legislation

1161
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,020
we have is actually providing that for

1162
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,660
us so I know my answer is a bit more on

1163
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,220
the metal level so I'm hoping for some

1164
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,740
more like concrete samples but I would

1165
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,240
just like to really pull back and

1166
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,560
sometimes think what kind of power

1167
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,599
structures are we supporting

1168
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,000
I think that's that's vitally important

1169
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,220
we often don't think enough about that

1170
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,839
that Future Vision and what it is that

1171
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,460
we're working for and what that would

1172
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,859
look like so I think Super lab has a

1173
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,319
huge role to play in helping us um to to

1174
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:03,300
move towards that and maybe before I

1175
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,339
move on if you had kind of one thing

1176
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,260
that you would like to see or recommend

1177
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,960
or that people could do to help us get

1178
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,480
to that more Equitable

1179
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,180
um vision and one that that does focus

1180
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,339
on on communities and power structures

1181
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,859
rather than individuals what what's that

1182
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:23,720
one thing that you would want to see

1183
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,618
oh that's a tough one

1184
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,079
um what I would like to see well that

1185
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,220
we're

1186
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,520
more future looking that what I would

1187
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,900
like to see is

1188
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,500
get together like in with like lots of

1189
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,359
different societal groups not just you

1190
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:44,579
know csos but also seeing like the

1191
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,220
community level what kind of future do

1192
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,619
we envision to for each other like for

1193
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,720
the specific thing like CSA regulation

1194
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,160
but can also be different issues and

1195
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,800
yeah Envision digital just Futures

1196
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,300
together and then pull back from that

1197
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,040
and see how we can like get there what

1198
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,900
steps we can derive from that so we'll

1199
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,640
just have more positive future outlook

1200
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,680
because I feel like working in in this

1201
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,859
sphere can often be very

1202
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,300
disheartening because we're just

1203
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,640
basically fighting all of these

1204
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,460
um yeah all of these very dystopian

1205
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,619
issues like Mass surveillance this is

1206
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,859
super super scary for many people so

1207
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,619
instead of just taking a look at what's

1208
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:27,240
negative also like pulling back and

1209
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,680
seeing like what future do you want how

1210
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,339
do we get there together

1211
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,079
Selena what about you what's

1212
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,160
what's the future internet

1213
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,240
you're asking all the big questions

1214
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,700
today

1215
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,559
um yeah I think

1216
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:46,140
um the futures of the internet I as I

1217
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,180
would like to frame it um

1218
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,480
a really tough question and I think it's

1219
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,700
something that we need to rethink

1220
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,780
together on a community-based level and

1221
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,079
talking about structural

1222
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:01,740
um

1223
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,700
problems I think we also have to rethink

1224
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,500
on how to involved involve discriminate

1225
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:15,059
discriminated groups I think in Tech as

1226
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:17,700
I can speak from this level this Ed

1227
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,760
women and stair approach won't work

1228
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,680
anymore

1229
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,140
because like it's so those structural

1230
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,380
problems are so deeply imprinted on how

1231
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,960
the internet was built and how the

1232
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,460
structured structures started to grow

1233
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,040
that we need to rethink on how we govern

1234
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,119
all this so in my opinion it needs to be

1235
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,700
in really interdisciplinary and really

1236
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,980
Community Driven really cross group

1237
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,440
exchange to shape Affair and future

1238
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,480
internet

1239
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,700
and you're one thing that you would want

1240
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,859
from from policy makers from those here

1241
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,800
today what one thing could help us move

1242
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,020
towards that

1243
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,059
I think they should better understand

1244
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:09,559
how the internet works

1245
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,640
um

1246
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,280
yeah I mean like I I think like

1247
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,099
historically speaking a lot of the time

1248
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:19,319
things go wrong because they don't

1249
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,839
understand the fundamentals of the

1250
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,420
internet and if you don't understand the

1251
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,400
fundamentals of the internet and why we

1252
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,319
thought it would be a really great thing

1253
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,700
to have

1254
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,240
an interconnected world then you don't

1255
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,819
know which parts you want to like take

1256
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,740
away and which parts you want to keep

1257
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,440
and I think this is really crucial to

1258
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,460
shape something more beautiful

1259
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,040
um then we now have

1260
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,420
yeah because you mentioned at the

1261
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,400
beginning that the CCC Charter has been

1262
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,980
around for for 40 years and if that

1263
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,380
vision of what we actually wanted the

1264
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,319
internet to look like as communities is

1265
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,119
maybe a really powerful idea and

1266
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:01,680
something that

1267
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,660
certain people who've been in charge of

1268
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,400
the drafting of this legislation maybe

1269
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,020
should have paid a little bit more

1270
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,480
attention to those who know my work will

1271
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,819
know exactly who I am referring to in

1272
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,319
that

1273
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:15,720
um and Patrick what about you what would

1274
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,000
be your right to respecting vision for

1275
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,099
the internet I'm afraid the policy

1276
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:21,780
makers are very much a cross-section of

1277
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,819
the society and we want them to be in a

1278
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:25,740
democracy but that means you'd have to

1279
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,800
educate everybody to be to improve their

1280
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,520
uh digital literacy but um after my my

1281
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,380
vision of our rights respecting a

1282
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,680
society you know before the digital age

1283
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,839
um it was self-evident that you had

1284
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,520
private spaces and family spaces and

1285
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,839
mass surveillance was simply not

1286
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,420
possible technologically and and my

1287
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,339
mission as as a digital freedom fighter

1288
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:54,140
has always been to preserve those

1289
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,780
private spaces and those rights in an

1290
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,000
age where it has become technologically

1291
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,640
possible to to place everyone and

1292
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,400
everything under surveillance and I I

1293
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,680
that's really my mission for for my own

1294
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,480
child but also for the generations to

1295
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,480
come because if we lose these freedom

1296
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,140
now it is hardly possible to to ever

1297
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,260
bring them back and as to what can we

1298
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,480
can specifically um achieve your your

1299
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,300
second question I think

1300
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,700
um that when it comes to the current

1301
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,460
discussions on the AI act and whether

1302
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,500
biometric Mass surveillance should be

1303
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,480
banned I think we have a certain window

1304
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,059
of opportunity of of achieving uh

1305
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,400
something that European Parliament might

1306
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,900
endorse that and maybe even something

1307
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,240
might come out of the negotiations you

1308
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,980
may have heard that even with the

1309
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,319
upcoming Olympic Games in in France

1310
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,540
where they want to install these systems

1311
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,520
that flag suspicious Behavior

1312
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,700
automatically they've stopped short of a

1313
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,180
facial recognition at least and so I

1314
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,980
hope that we we are getting somewhere

1315
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,059
and for the first time we may have

1316
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:05,160
proactively implemented a provision to

1317
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,500
protect the fundamental rights and I

1318
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,420
like that idea that you know we often

1319
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,280
focus on the negatives and and the

1320
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,200
things that we don't want but and and

1321
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,700
how hard things can be when we're

1322
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,859
fighting against enormous power

1323
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:18,119
structures and we're fighting against

1324
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,680
Mass surveillance but I think it's

1325
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,559
really critical to remember that we can

1326
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,780
also achieve a lot and that these kinds

1327
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,180
of forums are one space and and that it

1328
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,819
does actually make a difference

1329
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,520
um so before I move on to opening it up

1330
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,920
to the audience so please do cabin Mind

1331
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,240
questions you might want to ask the

1332
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,220
panelists or Reflections that you would

1333
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,079
like to make as well

1334
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,059
um I wanted to to be a bit cheeky and

1335
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:43,140
get a bit of information from you

1336
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,079
Patrick I know you've been kind of well

1337
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,300
kind of you have been suing Facebook

1338
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,700
around this topic I was wondering if you

1339
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,380
could maybe just give us a few words on

1340
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,480
the power of of the law and of

1341
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,119
litigation to also help us in these

1342
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,859
fights

1343
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,160
yes I'm actually a civil law judge by a

1344
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,440
profession and so I believe in the

1345
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,180
Judiciary and it's a very powerful

1346
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:09,240
system to defend a system of fundamental

1347
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,280
rights that we have created in a time of

1348
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,760
Crisis which was after the second world

1349
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,099
war a new order of fundamental rights

1350
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:18,599
has been established at National level

1351
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,180
but also the European Convention of of

1352
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,480
human rights for example and

1353
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,940
um yes that's one result that for the

1354
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,059
Judiciary and so that's why also on this

1355
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:33,000
topic of the CSA regulation I am

1356
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,720
suing meta because whenever I use

1357
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Facebook Messengers they scan my my

1358
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,800
private Communications without any

1359
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,920
reason and cause and that could include

1360
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,960
even confidential Communications with

1361
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,540
citizens that I have as a member of

1362
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,140
Parliament and so I have started this

1363
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,819
action in Germany in the nice city of

1364
00:57:56,819 --> 00:58:00,359
kiru where I'm from originally and meta

1365
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,119
has responded to that or their lawyers

1366
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,980
have responded with over I don't know 60

1367
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,619
or 70 pages but right now we're still

1368
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:10,859
struggling with a candidate the German

1369
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:14,640
courts decide on this at all and if so

1370
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,819
which court and so right now um the

1371
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,579
matter is going to be referred from the

1372
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:26,040
from the local level Court to a district

1373
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,119
court that deals with the matters that

1374
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,099
have a greater implications and greater

1375
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:34,440
value and they will then have to decide

1376
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,960
on can the German courts deal with it

1377
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,480
but at least the court where the matter

1378
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,880
is currently pending says as a

1379
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,140
preliminary idea they think that yes

1380
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,780
they can actually deal with what Mata is

1381
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,000
doing because this concerns citizens in

1382
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,700
Europe and so they have the right to

1383
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,079
contest this in in European courts where

1384
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,020
um where they are living and so it will

1385
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,640
take a long time as it always will

1386
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,140
that's why we need to stop this

1387
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,680
politically

1388
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,059
kind of things so I think we remain

1389
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:14,220
hopeful but we will not give up the

1390
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,319
fight either on on trying to actually

1391
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,839
make sure that the EU withdraws this

1392
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,640
really dangerous legislation and

1393
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,500
replaces it with something that is

1394
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,180
actually going to be effective and

1395
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,880
actually going to protect children

1396
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,099
rather than surveilling all of us do you

1397
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,599
know I've been seeing the the German

1398
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,760
government over logging our internet use

1399
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,240
of public websites for 14 years now and

1400
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,099
it's still pending okay so not too

1401
00:59:38,099 --> 00:59:40,500
optimistic this is why we need to fight

1402
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,140
on every front that we have

1403
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,940
um so maybe finally for the panelists I

1404
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,980
want to give you a space for anything

1405
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,720
that hasn't been said yet from your

1406
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,180
perspective if you would like to and

1407
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,579
then we'll turn to the audience so no

1408
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,819
pressure

1409
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,260
yeah I guess

1410
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,420
um one point I would like to finish off

1411
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,359
with is um some the Caesar is something

1412
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,660
that we happen to see very often in the

1413
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,119
last few years which is solving complex

1414
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,059
social problems with a seemingly simple

1415
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:15,180
technical solution which is Tech

1416
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,579
solutionism as it as high as it gets and

1417
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:23,280
also this really weird belief that those

1418
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,780
big tech companies that we are hardly

1419
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,480
being able to regulate can solve such a

1420
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,260
problem in a fair and rights respecting

1421
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,940
way is for me like the weirdest thing

1422
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,819
that one could pursue so I think this is

1423
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:45,119
something that we will see more and more

1424
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,059
and that we really need to fight and to

1425
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:52,859
explain that we can't solve complex

1426
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:55,700
social problems purely from a technology

1427
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,980
technological point of view that we need

1428
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,619
to work as I said before

1429
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,780
interdisciplinary and address the root

1430
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,180
cause of those problems because

1431
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,660
otherwise wise we will end up with mass

1432
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,180
surveillance and and destroyed internet

1433
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,940
as we know it

1434
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:18,140
yeah and from my perspective this whole

1435
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,700
framing of uh protect our children

1436
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,579
that's often used to also try to divide

1437
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:26,040
the society space as well or from a

1438
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,020
feminist perspective and like also

1439
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,780
feminist groups we can see this with the

1440
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,059
debates on sex work and porn in the 80s

1441
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,619
and the US that kind of came over to

1442
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:36,780
Europe as well we see this with the

1443
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,079
debate on trans people's rights uh which

1444
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,220
was always frameless we have to say

1445
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,020
protect our children from these bad

1446
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,859
influences which is used to uh yeah

1447
01:01:46,859 --> 01:01:48,780
restrict fundamental rights so we also

1448
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,880
have to kind of really see

1449
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,180
could go like take a step back and not

1450
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,319
take the narrative that's being

1451
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:57,720
presented to us as the truth but also

1452
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,119
see what this what lecture series are

1453
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:02,339
trying to do or who's also pushing these

1454
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:04,460
narratives who's benefiting from it

1455
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,200
because this protective narrative is

1456
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,319
just always used

1457
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,579
by also very conservative

1458
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,260
anti-democratic

1459
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,339
um

1460
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:16,500
uh yeah actors and I'm not saying that

1461
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,420
the commission is is anti-democratic but

1462
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,500
I was just saying this is a narrative

1463
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,720
that's also pushed by actors that are

1464
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,579
against Reproductive Rights

1465
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:26,700
um so just always keep that in mind he

1466
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,000
has the goal to make sure that child

1467
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,920
sexual abuse material is not distributed

1468
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,040
is really important but we can't use

1469
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,680
this topic to pull back on fundamental

1470
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,299
rights and we have to be really Vigilant

1471
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:41,520
to not be separate as well on the like

1472
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,940
Civil Society sphere by these topics

1473
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,819
a very good reminder to to be critical

1474
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:50,760
of these narratives so now opening it

1475
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,980
back up to the audience we'd love to

1476
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,900
hear if you have questions for a

1477
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,460
particular panelist as well please do

1478
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,440
specify who you would like to hear from

1479
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,200
but also please just feel free to share

1480
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,359
your your Reflections or interventions

1481
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,000
into this discussion

1482
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,559
we've got one question

1483
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,220
hello everyone good morning my name is

1484
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,440
Victoria pinedu I'm a climate activist

1485
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,079
from an house in the Brazilian Amazon we

1486
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:26,819
apart from a Youth Organization I call

1487
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:29,099
it palmatic section lab and my question

1488
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:31,140
is how you can see

1489
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,880
um with this you're talking about the

1490
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,700
censorships and so on how youth can play

1491
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,400
a role in this future of the internet

1492
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,260
and most on the governance how you for

1493
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,540
you can fertilize the governance based

1494
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,059
the new action

1495
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,799
should we have the second question as

1496
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,540
well and then panelists can answer

1497
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,680
thank you hi I'm Stitch ethical hacker

1498
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,040
and um uh I'm always wondering where

1499
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,780
does this stop because I'm in this

1500
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,640
community like for 10 years and it's

1501
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,619
always the same Trojan Horse child born

1502
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:10,799
and such so we have to kill everybody's

1503
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:13,140
celebrities and freedoms and we do that

1504
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,059
now online now so that there's now some

1505
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,859
such a thing that we have to have

1506
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:20,339
legislation on that so suppose the

1507
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:22,619
legislation passes and the internet is

1508
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:25,440
dead crime still happens there's still

1509
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,520
horrible things happening so um what

1510
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,020
would be the next step to make it even

1511
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,839
worse then should we all wear cameras or

1512
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,059
what what should we record each other

1513
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:37,799
all the time and what happens when the

1514
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:40,680
cameras go off so it would be maybe even

1515
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,260
cheaper to do that instead of limiting

1516
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,819
the internet so

1517
01:04:44,819 --> 01:04:48,119
what's what are there any Visions to

1518
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,280
make it even darker and even worse than

1519
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,319
just killing the internet because that's

1520
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,558
easy

1521
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,819
you're welcome by the way I'm normally a

1522
01:04:56,819 --> 01:04:58,940
very happy person

1523
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,980
great so yeah would anyone like to share

1524
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,020
either on youth involvement or this

1525
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,940
question of where does it stop slash

1526
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,940
what next I I would really much like to

1527
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,040
answer to the question of Youth

1528
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,520
involvement and I think it's

1529
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,920
a really big problem to solve because

1530
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,319
what I'm seeing is like

1531
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:21,900
youth feels really powerless when it

1532
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,540
comes to the internet and big platforms

1533
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,520
and that they are not in control of

1534
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,579
their data and or even they are like

1535
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:32,220
accepting that they are not in control

1536
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,920
and I think what we really need to do is

1537
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,880
to

1538
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,920
try to take back control and to really

1539
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,339
talk about data protection and our

1540
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:46,740
rights and the rights that we have and

1541
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,900
talk with young people about that and

1542
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,400
talk about

1543
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,500
um surveillance capitalism and what is

1544
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,980
it is doing to our generation and also

1545
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,740
to especially in the climate movement

1546
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,319
where people are being framed as being

1547
01:06:01,319 --> 01:06:04,799
terrorists for examples and we are

1548
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,020
seeing this in Germany that data

1549
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:10,280
protection is solidarity so think about

1550
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,020
what infrastructure do you want to use

1551
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,579
to communicate I'm also talking about

1552
01:06:16,579 --> 01:06:19,619
what do I need to take my phone to every

1553
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:21,599
intervention we are doing or every

1554
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,940
protest because that can be a really

1555
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,720
really big issue but also to start

1556
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,619
understanding I think this is the

1557
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:30,839
missing link and all the I would say

1558
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,059
like old generation hackers tend to

1559
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,400
forget you grew up with the internet

1560
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,579
growing up while we are meeting with an

1561
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:42,380
internet this is that is so complex that

1562
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,000
also like if you're a computer assigned

1563
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,460
student you struggle to understand so

1564
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,940
what we need is to to get together and

1565
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,220
explain the different steps and also

1566
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,460
identify moments where we can intervene

1567
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,460
for example through internet

1568
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,260
standardization things with the ietf

1569
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,240
bringing Youth and bringing climate

1570
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,400
activists in also talking about the

1571
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,280
human rights perspective and

1572
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,900
um yeah

1573
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,780
having access to more information about

1574
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,420
that and I think that can be really

1575
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,039
empowering and bringing everything

1576
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,940
forward and I know that often it is a

1577
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,799
capacity problem especially in the

1578
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,020
climate movement but there are people

1579
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:26,640
who are experts in this field and

1580
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,440
they're really happy to help you with

1581
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,740
that and you don't need to be in

1582
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,619
computer scientist expert but you can

1583
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:36,539
ask those experts and they are happy to

1584
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:38,520
help and I really understand that the

1585
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,260
goals you are fighting for are complex

1586
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,720
and it's really hard so we need to stand

1587
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,680
together to be empowered and create a

1588
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,039
more yeah a better future for the

1589
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:52,500
internet that empowers our movements as

1590
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,700
well

1591
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,700
foreign

1592
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,559
so then I'll take your your question on

1593
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:03,480
what will happen if this proposal passes

1594
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,559
well um on the pessimistic side

1595
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,240
um what they would do is to try and

1596
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,339
expand on it as I explained right they

1597
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:14,099
will they will start looking for other

1598
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:16,198
content other than child sexual

1599
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,000
exploitation material and they will

1600
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,580
start to to scan more devices and and

1601
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:23,719
and spaces

1602
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:25,620
um certainly the the five eyes the

1603
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,979
intelligence Services would demand that

1604
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,040
end-to-end encrypted messenger services

1605
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,460
will also use this new client-side

1606
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,839
scanning function to basically disclose

1607
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,960
the communications of their targets so

1608
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,960
they will want encryption to be broken

1609
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,000
also for other purposes of the

1610
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,420
intelligence services but on the on the

1611
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,698
in the positive scenario what could

1612
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:55,679
happen if this law process is that

1613
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,439
people understand the value value of of

1614
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:01,100
privacy and we'll start moving to

1615
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,140
decentralized messenger systems because

1616
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,899
those are the ones that do not have a

1617
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,698
service provider who could implement

1618
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:13,520
this uh charge control legislation maybe

1619
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,600
end-to-end encryption finally becomes

1620
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,359
the default for email Communications as

1621
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,120
a result of this because this is also

1622
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,560
something that's done on your own device

1623
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,679
and that no provider could control and

1624
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,080
maybe and I hope of course the courts

1625
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,660
will stop it after a shorter period than

1626
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,439
14 years

1627
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,319
I've got one here oh great um I guess if

1628
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,120
you all agree we can take even two

1629
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,979
because we started 10 minutes late but

1630
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,939
only if you all agree

1631
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,259
sure

1632
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:51,359
hello I'm claudiogusti thank you for the

1633
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,640
great talk I have two questions on the

1634
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,640
technical side one is how this

1635
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,699
enforcement looks like like if a signal

1636
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:01,560
or telegram they don't want to comply

1637
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,480
means that the day will be forbidden in

1638
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,600
the European Play Store or does it mean

1639
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,520
that if they comply will exist the

1640
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,100
European signal and the non-european

1641
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,420
signal

1642
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,760
and the second is the digital Market

1643
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,460
acts as far as you know there is some

1644
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:20,040
proposal to do interoperability between

1645
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,679
Charter system and they wonder if this

1646
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,780
will also be used as a way to weakening

1647
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,620
the encryption

1648
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,980
is there another question

1649
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,339
okay

1650
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,620
uh hello my name is yurai Seifert I'm

1651
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,860
from Rio University at Brussel

1652
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:47,280
I was to say maybe to be more more

1653
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,800
optimistic

1654
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,420
I just just wanted to reply to the

1655
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,400
previous

1656
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,380
uh question and say that you know even

1657
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,360
if the laws get adopted it doesn't mean

1658
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,340
that they will actually be enforced and

1659
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,219
they are workable so maybe that can help

1660
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:04,080
because there are simply some

1661
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,780
legislation that is not working uh be

1662
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,760
the good legislation or bad legislation

1663
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,480
but my question is for uh for MEP Braya

1664
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,400
I wanted to ask you whether there is a

1665
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,760
way to reverse this sort of policy trend

1666
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,000
of Outsourcing law enforcement because I

1667
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,400
think this is not just happening in this

1668
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,280
particular discussion here but if you

1669
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,719
look at the broader picture of the

1670
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,280
European legislation that is being

1671
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,520
adopted in this area so like e-evidence

1672
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,520
package before that PNR before that data

1673
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,280
retention Saga I think there is a

1674
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,260
certain trend of Outsourcing law

1675
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,140
enforcement

1676
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,580
activities to private companies so I'm

1677
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,040
just wondering is there a policy way to

1678
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,300
actually reverse this trend

1679
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:58,739
yes thank you for your questions okay

1680
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:00,840
the first was how to enforce this

1681
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,820
against providers that are not based in

1682
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,880
the EU so the legislation is to apply to

1683
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,440
all services that are being offered

1684
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,659
within the EU even if they are not based

1685
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,320
in the EU if a provider doesn't comply I

1686
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,780
you can only enforce it if they have

1687
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,239
some business interests in the EU which

1688
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,060
signal may not have but they could

1689
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,580
certainly for example pressure the app

1690
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,400
stores to remove it for EU customers

1691
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,860
which will make it very difficult

1692
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,080
or difficult for many to install not for

1693
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,800
us but for the digitally not so literate

1694
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,380
a second question was is the

1695
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,780
interoperability of Messengers an attack

1696
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,659
on safe end-to-end encryption we

1697
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,580
definitely don't want it to be we've

1698
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,320
pushed very hard for this because it

1699
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,500
breaks up the monopolies of WhatsApp and

1700
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,620
the like that use very bad terms and

1701
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,860
conditions and you basically don't have

1702
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,560
a chance to to change to other services

1703
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,300
because you'd lose all your your

1704
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,120
contacts and groups so we've pushed hard

1705
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,520
for this but of course we want new

1706
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,120
protocols to be developed to to make

1707
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,080
end-to-end encryption work

1708
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,020
cross-platform and be just as safe so we

1709
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,140
will make very sure that this is

1710
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:17,460
guaranteed

1711
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,860
and on the third question of the trend

1712
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:23,640
for privatizing law enforcement

1713
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,760
yes it's definitely a trend that we see

1714
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,640
in many pieces of legislation what can

1715
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,239
help us is scandals so I hope that

1716
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:34,320
something goes wrong and everybody

1717
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,980
learns about it and maybe that will open

1718
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,519
their eyes

1719
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:45,300
okay then well in that case I think we

1720
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,940
will wrap up with an enormous thank you

1721
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,699
to Alina Karina and Patrick for these

1722
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:53,280
fantastic insights and also to all of

1723
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,440
you for your attention and participation

1724
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,420
I can't tell you how happy it makes me

1725
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:59,880
that it was actually successful to ask

1726
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,040
for some you know audience responses and

1727
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,199
insights um so I really appreciate you

1728
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:06,360
kind of stepping up and bringing that to

1729
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,000
help enrich our discussion as well and

1730
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,739
what I will do as a kind of final

1731
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:12,719
Shameless plug is say if you're

1732
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,580
interested in this topic check out stop

1733
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,960
scanningme.edu which is the campaign

1734
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,219
that

1735
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:23,100
um edry CCC and many other organizations

1736
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,760
are involved in coordinating to call on

1737
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,880
the EU institutions to remove this

1738
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,040
dangerous legislation and do something

1739
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,440
better so you can follow that campaign

1740
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,420
and you can get involved and I'm sure I
