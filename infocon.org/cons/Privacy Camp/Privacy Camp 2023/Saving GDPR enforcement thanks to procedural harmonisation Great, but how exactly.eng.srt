and I have been told so please if it's

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,660
too technical if they use streams

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,000
numbers that don't mean anything to you

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160

questions will I look at my phone not

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
because I'm ignoring the speakers but to

68
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
watch the questions there is another

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,540
panel at the same time so please maybe

70
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,500

71
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,180
question comes to us and not to the

72
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,459
other panel or but maybe we can also

73
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,400
extend questions

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,640
yes good so we will start what is this

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
about this is about the gdpr the gdpr

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,620
almost five years old it is working we

77
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,180
know it is working but it is working

78
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,360
perfectly or is it working painfully

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,180
um you can choose your answer and we can

80
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
discuss how we can make it work better

81
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,340
this is the the subject to discuss this

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,959
subject and and specifically this

83
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
question of procedural organization we

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,440
have fourth grade speakers I will

85
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
briefly introduce them in the order of

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,599
speaking first elicit mustard I think

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,400
it's the wrong accent because you are

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,220
actually from but it doesn't matter and

89
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,260
sees a researcher working on DPA

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,620
cooperation and DPR enforcement then we

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,459
have no I know speaking order

92
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,099

93
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,159
of the edpb Secretariat following

94
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,659
closely all these questions about

95
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,180
harmonization of procedures for

96
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,420
cooperation of DPS then we have Roma

97
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,380
Robert who is program director

98
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,298
none of your business you know a famous

99
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,358
famous NGO working on digital rights and

100
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,759
finally we have Maria magerska who is

101
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,919
also a researcher working in on the

102
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,740
question of the role of DPS and how DPS

103
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,460
work good well or not together so we

104
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,740
will all discuss this subject I will not

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,300
go into the research of the subject

106
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,820
because that's the task for early set so

107
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,880
you all have eight ten minutes and I

108
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,740

109
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,840
somebody will be strict with me please

go ahead and we will have time for

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,540
questions of course later

112
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,560
um yes

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,900
it should know if you if you insist yes

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,880
hello hello does it

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,940
change thanks okay thank you for this

116
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,000
kind introduction I will just briefly

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,979
sketch the situation and how we got to

118
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,600
this point where we are actually

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,180
discussing procedural harmonization for

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,860
the gdpr

121
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,139
um so these discussions take place in

122
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,940
the context of cross-border decision

123
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,479
making so decisions where authorities

124
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
from several member states are supposed

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
to cooperate to receive one outcome and

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,539
that they actually reach consensus on

127
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,340
the outcome of for instance a complaint

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
or a known initiative investigation and

129
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,259
that takes place in the case where

130
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,660
either the data subjects affected are

131
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,820
located in several member states or when

132
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,860
the data processing takes place in the

133
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,259
context of multiple establishments in

134
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,620
several member states and in order to to

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,320
come to certain consensual outcome

136
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,020
together the lead and concerned

137
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,900
authorities are required to exchange

138
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,820
information they can assist each other

139
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,699
via multi your assistance requests they

140
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,280
can organize joint operations and very

141
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,460
importantly there is this

142
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,199
consensus making procedure laid down in

143
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,479
the gdpr where the lead Authority has to

144
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,699
share its draft decision with the other

145
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,560
concerned authorities before it actually

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,500
adopts a decision and that allows for a

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,840
lot of interaction between the dpas and

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,539
and delete DPA is actually required to

149
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,900
take into account these objections if

150
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,020
objections exist

151
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,120
so there is a consensual outcome is the

152
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,979
ID

153
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,160
but the difficulty is that it requires a

154
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,500
lot of interaction among dpas and all

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,080
these dpas are

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,060
acting in accordance with our own

157
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,759
National procedural rules and it is the

158
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,560
situation is even more complicated when

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
the European data protection board steps

160
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
in because

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,919
um it has it has softer tools to to step

162
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,259
in and it can support cooperation for

163
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,780
instance via the support both experts

164
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,819
and it provides a platform for

165
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,940
interaction among the epas but it also

166
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,419
has stronger competences it can adopt

167
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,819
guidance on how National dpas should

168
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,400
interact with each other on how

169
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,100
procedural procedure should function on

170
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,800
how substantive data gdpr provision

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,580
should be interpreted and so either this

172
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,919
influences National decision making but

173
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,599
National decision making can also be

174
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,580
influenced by the board via binding

175
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,919
decisions and then you get these very

176
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,699
complex composite procedures where

177
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,160
I want to leave this paper somewhere you

178
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,780
get this complex composite procedures

179
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,639
where input into the final decision

180
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,539
comes from either a European Body or and

181
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,840
usually and several National authorities

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,080
and this creates very complex procedures

183
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,319
where this network structure as we can

184
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,640
call it is

185
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,000
[Music]

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,900
um

187
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,360
not always functioning effectively it

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,759
can hinder cope it can hinder

189
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,560
enforcement in the sense that it becomes

190
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,319
extremely cumbersome and complex and

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,139
therefore slows down enforcement but it

192
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,599
may also deprive the parties to the

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,440
procedure of their procedural rights

194
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,660
um and therefore it does certainly not

195
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,180
always lead to effective protection of

196
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,379
personal rights or broader

197
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,180
fundamental rights such as the right to

198
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,699
good Administration

199
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,520
certain defense rights may be violated

200
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,379
but there but also the duty of sincere

201
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,399
cooperation maybe maybe hindered by how

202
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,839
this gdpr system is is designed and I'm

203
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,820
very sure that this is not an easy

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,120
exercise to address and therefore I

205
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
think it's very important that this

206
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,279
panel is hearing that we can discuss

207
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,959
what this procedural actually look like

208
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,500
so we have to think about what kind what

209
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,420
type of legal instruments can be adopted

210
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,940
a legal basis for it but most

211
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,440
importantly it's content and I think

212
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,880
regarding its contents there are there

213
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,980
are two aspects that are important to

214
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,480
address and

215
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,580
this either stems from this duty of

216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,620
sincere cooperation and the right to

217
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,720
good Administration on the one hand and

218
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,959
on the other hand this um these rights

219
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,899
of the defense so to address the first

220
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,779
you see that my national authorities are

221
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,399
all acting in accordance with their own

222
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,620
National procedures

223
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,600
um this does not only make enforcement

224
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,060
very complex and cumbersome but it may

225
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,800
also hinder effective enforcement

226
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,779
because National authorities are for

227
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,380
instance not able to request opinions

228
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,180
from another data protection authority

229
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,920
throughout your procedure because they

230
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,680
had to adhere to their National

231
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,980
deadlines which could be very strict or

232
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,959
the possibility to participate in a

233
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,880
joint operation may not be implemented

234
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,180
which which does not allow the DPA to

235
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,279
actually participate in those

236
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,920
or confidentiality reasons a national

237
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
procedural laws may not allow dpas to

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,140
share information for instance

239
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,480
throughout the ongoing investigation and

240
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,339
then you see that many aspects of the

241
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,380
enforcement procedure are only discussed

242
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,600
at the end when this consensual

243
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
decision-making process formally starts

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
where it is often too late to actually

245
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,600
address certain problems because

246
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,880
sometimes national law for instance

247
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,100
doesn't allow to reopen an investigation

248
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,959
and broaden the scope because they only

249
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,660
had 30 days to do so and those 30 days

250
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,519
will certainly have been passed when you

251
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,320
finally reach this consensual

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,779
decision-making stage so on the one hand

253
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,360
we have these National procedures that

254
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,779
hinder cooperation but also do not

255
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,120
always ensure that you actually that

256
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,399
your procedural rights are protected so

257
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,959
the right to be heard access to

258
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,459
documents because sometimes you're not

259
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,279
even a party to the procedure but and on

260
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,740
the other hand we have problems with

261
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,459
um the details of cooperation

262
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,260
obligations that are not very clear in

263
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,420
the gdpr so

264
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,480
um even when National authorities are

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,740
able to

266
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,120
um to actually cooperate International

267
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,880
procedural laws would allow so there's a

268
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,940
lot of uncertainty about how this

269
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,740
cooperation procedure shall function so

270
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,279
there are no legal deadlines it is not

271
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,140
defined what a draft decision is what it

272
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,800
revised draft decision shall look like

273
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,180
how long you actually have to revise

274
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,760
your job's decision but also how you

275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,380
should reach consensus on the scope of

276
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,120
an investigation early on in the

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,760
procedure and that are also all kind of

278
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,620
details that can actually be addressed

279
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,880
in procedural law specifically

280
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,519
applicable to the gdpr

281
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,500
um yeah so I I think there's a lot to

282
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,380
win in particular

283
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,540
with harmonizing these investigation and

284
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,220
decision making processes that are

285
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,200
applicable to the National dpas when

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,480
they exercise their tasks but also with

287
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
regard to these cooperation obligations

288
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,420
to to have them more detailed and more

289
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,779
specified

290
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,519
yes because I had to make sure that you

291
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,839
are following are you following

292
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,380
everything yes so now we had a very

293
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,200
close like zoom in into this many issues

294
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,360
that are appear when DPS have to

295
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,160
cooperate in the context of the One-Stop

296
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
shop and so when does this all this mess

297
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,860
happen actually it happened when there

298
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,779
is this cross-border processing of data

299
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,480
typically somebody lodges a complaint

300
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,820
with a DPA in one member state but the

301
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,500
controller is based has the main

302
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,180
establishment in another member State

303
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,880
and then there's this situation is

304
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
triggered automatically in this whole

305
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
situation where they have to do all this

306
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,639
cooperation following those rules that

307
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,500
are unclear even to somebody who has

308
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
been working on this for four years all

309
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,899
this is is what we have and and what we

310
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,820
have now is an acknowledgment of the

311
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,740
fact that indeed there are problems it's

312
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,660
not clear how the DPS have to cooperate

313
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,760
in this One-Stop shop mechanism and

314
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,220
therefore a sort of agreement that we

315
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,720
need a new set of rules that would

316
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
clarify the procedure I think that it's

317
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,720
a third summary and then yes and the

318
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,079
edpb is really at the core of this

319
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,600
somehow not I will blame the EDP but a

320
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,860
victim and and certainly not fully only

321
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,440
person responsible but we can listen out

322
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,000
to the EDP

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,200
so um thank you for this introduction so

324
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,560
so yeah I worked for the the ddpb dpb is

325
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,540
the European data protection board I

326
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,980
work for ddpb Secretariat so the people

327
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,139
providing analytical support logistical

328
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,079
support administrative support to this

329
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,060
board which is the group of European

330
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,700
data protection authorities so all the

331
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,220
national authorities are part of the dpb

332
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,980
the chair of the ddpb is the chair of

333
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,740
the Austrian Authority Andrea unique

334
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,700
right now and uh and they work together

335
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,240
to make sure that that gdpr is applied

336
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,180
in a consistent way everywhere no matter

337
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,820
where you are located in Europe that's

338
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,279
our job we have a regulation the

339
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,139
regulation has to be applied in the same

340
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,440
way everywhere and the dpb is there to

341
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,959
make sure that all the authorities

342
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,700
collaborate correctly work in the same

343
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,019
way and find consensus what gdpr says is

344
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,700
that when there's a case that involves

345
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,079
several member states the authorities

346
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,240
have to work together and they have to

347
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
find the consensus uh so working

348
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,160
together means you need to have common

349
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,440
methods a common understanding of the

350
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,779
concept of the law and so on and so

351
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,420
forth so this is why we at ddpb issue

352
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,600
guidelines to explain the all the

353
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
articles in gdpr and authorities are not

354
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,920
always in agreement so sometimes

355
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,360
they think they should solve a case in a

356
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,180
specific way but the authority that is

357
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,339
leading the case does not necessarily

358
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,260
agree with the other authorities in the

359
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,360
other member states this is rare because

360
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,579
in most of most of the time there's an

361
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,100
agreement and they find the consensus on

362
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,079
the decision but when it's not the case

363
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,420
there's what we call dispute resolution

364
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,540
mechanism and this is why why where ddpb

365
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,139
comes in and says well this is what uh

366
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,260
the the lead Authority proposed this is

367
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,899
the objections that were filed against

368
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,300
this draft decision and we say who is

369
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,639
right and who is wrong and how the the

370
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,980
final decision has to be amended so so

371
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,500
that's our we do guidance and we

372
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,600
contribute to the consistent application

373
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,380
of gdpr on all the enforcement related

374
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,019
matters now don't forget that gdpr is

375
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,420
still a very young legislation it's been

376
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,600
there for less than five years it became

377
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,720
applicable in May 2018

378
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,279
we had data Protection Law in the EU

379
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,220
since 1995 but

380
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,860
there was little

381
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,360
cooperation on enforcement and the stick

382
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,160
that the authorities had at the time was

383
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,399
much smaller I used to work before for

384
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,959
the French Authority for instance the

385
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
maximum fine we could give at the

386
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,600
beginning of the 20 years 2010 was 150

387
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
000 Euros

388
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,920
with gdpr it's 20 million awful percent

389
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,199
of the annual turnover as the biggest

390
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,540
figure it counts so the stick is much

391
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,720
bigger the rules are different so we

392
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
need to learn together how to how to use

393
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,279
these powers

394
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,339
uh so you understood that with gdpr the

395
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,079
big change for the authorities is not

396
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,339
that they work together it's the fact

397
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,339
that there's much more enforcement much

398
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,500
higher stakes and much much higher

399
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,420
powers in terms of enforcement for the

400
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,519
authorities so we've been doing a lot at

401
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,759
tdpb on enforcement cooperation uh we

402
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,259
have a strategy where we said

403
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,420
enforcement is one hour of our top

404
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,899
priorities we had last year a meeting of

405
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,720
the Commissioners in Vienna the hometown

406
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,660
of the chair of the edpb where we

407
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,940
discussed how to be more efficient on on

408
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,339
cooperation and within many initiatives

409
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,380
where the authority on a daily basis

410
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,780
worked together for better enforcement

411
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,000
cooperation so I'll just list a few very

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,760
quickly uh there's a report that was

413
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,699
published on cloud computing last week

414
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,919
which is the result of the work that 22

415
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,819
authorities conducted at National level

416
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,919
about the use of cloud services in the

417
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,040
public sector and we identified problems

418
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,340
or challenges that the public sector

419
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,799
stakeholders may may face and we did a

420
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
number of recommendations for them also

421
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,780
there's task forces for instance there's

422
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,520
a report that was also published last

423
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,340
year last week on cookies how you have

424
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,860
to present the cookie banners where even

425
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,960
though this is a matter that is decided

426
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,380
at National level outside of the common

427
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,480
decision-making process that that was

428
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,340
explained before it's a different piece

429
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,679
of legislation we still discuss how this

430
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,080
has to be applied we try to find common

431
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,440
views and we explain

432
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
how we interpret complaints that are

433
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
filed in the different member states to

434
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,340
make sure that as much as possible the

435
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,400
decisions are going to be consistent

436
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,440
another example is that was listed

437
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,020
before is dspe the support pool of

438
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,179
asphet basically this facilitates

439
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,640
exchanges of experts between authorities

440
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,760
on enforcement related matters so there

441
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,059
again it's exchanging expertise is a is

442
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,400
a capacity and capability building if

443
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,919
you want and at the same time we have a

444
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,260
pool of external experts that we can use

445
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,039
to help us to assist us on various

446
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
assignments that we Define related to

447
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,260
enforcement we have more than 400 people

448
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,480
on the list that we can we can use

449
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,160
depending on their expertise and

450
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,679
depending on our needs

451
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,720
um other things that we decided to do is

452
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
to have a common template for complaints

453
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,440
for instance because in different member

454
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,380
states the when you file a complaint as

455
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,960
a citizen is not necessarily exactly the

456
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,580
same things or that are going to be

457
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,980
asked or not exactly in the same way and

458
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,660
we're trying to harmonize this as much

459
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,820
as possible we're sharing a lot of

460
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,919
knowledge also on the decisions that

461
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,020
were taken at National level to make

462
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,179
sure that when the case pops up in a

463
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,039
member state if this was already

464
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,260
discussed somewhere else we don't

465
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,419
reinvent the wheel and if there's

466
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:26,280
differences at least these differences

467
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,520
are taken in a conscious way because you

468
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,320
know what the others had what what other

469
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,840
decisions have been taken so you see we

470
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,059
are 100 committed to this enforcement

471
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,679
cooperation but we can't do everything

472
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,500
on our own and this is why it has been

473
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,559
last year a call to the European

474
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,720
commission to do more procedural

475
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
harmonization because there's

476
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,919
differences in National procedural law

477
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,740
and we believe that if we streamline

478
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,780
this a bit more it's going to be

479
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,360
beneficial to enforcement cooperation on

480
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,679
top of all the initiatives that we're

481
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,520
already conducting so uh basically what

482
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,679
we did is with four years of experience

483
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,480
of gdpr we went to the National

484
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
authorities we tried to understand what

485
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
problems they had in cross-builder

486
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
cooperation with the other authorities

487
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,299
and we put this together in a document

488
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,799
that we called the wish list which was

489
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,799
adopted in October which we put together

490
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,200
also after having consulted with ngos

491
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,539
because some ngos were invited to the

492
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,940
plenary meeting in in September and they

493
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,220
provided some input and we have a long

494
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,260
letter which is published on the adpb

495
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,600
website which was sent to the commission

496
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,440
and included in the 2023 work program at

497
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,000
the commission so it means that they

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,900
committed to produce some

499
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,340
harmonization to to deal with at least

500
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,840
some of the issues that we we have

501
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,419
identified I won't give you a long list

502
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,460
of all these procedural issues you can

503
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,340
find them in the letter but they tackle

504
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,720
among others the the procedural rights

505
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,539
because they're different or implemented

506
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,640
differently depending on depending on

507
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
the member states for instance in some

508
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,380
countries the complainant is not a party

509
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,620
to the procedure in other countries it's

510
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,260
the case so it means the way the

511
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,640
authority is tackling the case at

512
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,860
National level

513
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,260
depends on the member State and if it's

514
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,059
not harmonized this can create

515
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,100
objections to the way the procedural is

516
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,960
tackled and then this pops up at

517
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
European level when there's this

518
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,080
agreement and we have to solve this so

519
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,360
it takes more time and perhaps it's

520
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
something we can solve by Design uh

521
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,179
there's deadlines uh sometimes on the

522
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,340
some deadlines are not specified in in

523
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,820
gdpr so we identified them where we

524
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,260
think it would be beneficial to have

525
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,539
some deadlines

526
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:47,100
there's criteria for the admissibility

527
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,140
of complaints or

528
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,720
the the data you need to provide when

529
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,520
you file a complaint is not necessarily

530
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,679
the same uh depending on the member

531
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,419
state where where you are where you're

532
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,240
based uh the investigative power of the

533
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,679
authorities to determine if they're

534
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,960
competent so can I deal the case can I

535
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,059
deal with the case myself or do I need

536
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,220
to send the case to another Authority in

537
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,840
order to do this you need to investigate

538
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
a little bit and there's a question how

539
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,260
much you can do that the information

540
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,000
that you have to exchange with the other

541
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,299
authorities to cooperate correctly

542
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,280
and other aspects related to cooperation

543
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,559
so this is in detail what we sent to a

544
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,080
commission and they committed to deal

545
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,679
with this as much as they can in 2023 so

546
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,360
we're very happy that they committed to

547
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,520
this because we think this is going to

548
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,480
further improve the cooperation within

549
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,100
the ddpb between the national

550
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,740
authorities cooperation that already

551
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,960
exists in practice and is already quite

552
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,440
efficient as as you saw based on on what

553
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,659
I explained before so yeah based on it's

554
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,760
only for you years we did a lot in four

555
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,200
years there's more and more Enforcement

556
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,840
cases popping up big Enforcement cases

557
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,780
and we're looking forward to continue to

558
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,400
improve and be more efficient that's

559
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,419
what we do at tdpb every day

560
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:04,919
thank you thank you very much so indeed

561
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,780
the the the last part another very last

562
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,000
part but the almost last part this wish

563
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
list of um changes or improvements for

564
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,740
uh national uh procedural cooperation

565
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,740
that's um I think the the the specific

566
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,480
subject that we which we are trying to

567
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
focus as you can hear we know that it's

568
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,740
there are issues that um it's

569
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,299
complicated sometimes but also data

570
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,280
protection authorities know sometimes it

571
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,720
is complicated indeed in practice

572
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,120
because of the procedures this Quizlet

573
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
also refers to practices practices that

574
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,220
will be somehow um difficult to

575
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,080
reconcile and it

576
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,419
the Civil Society was involved in this

577
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,280
discussion and it did that was the case

578
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,860
because this is not just an issue for

579
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,260
dpas that will be very boring of course

580
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,940
if it was only about DPS cooperating

581
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,400
what is a stake of course is data

582
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,620
protection remedies it is uh can you

583
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,020
actually have any faith when a lot a

584
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,400
complaint that there will be a

585
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,520
meaningful uh time timely follow-up and

586
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,380
this is why it's also very important to

587
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,419
have here the voice of somebody who has

588
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,000
uh experience in in scene in trying to

589
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,159
make this work and keep insisting of

590
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,679
this and and with this I give the floor

591
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,280
to Roma

592
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,500
hello and good afternoon everyone is it

593
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,840
working yeah it's just losing my voice

594
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,179
um I I decided this morning to walk

595
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:31,919
through a journey a journey it was the

596
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,780
one that we had with the meta decision I

597
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,960
I guess you all heard about about the

598
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,960
meta decision adopted by edpb last week

599
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,000
and two weeks ago when uh Noah tried to

600
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,620
complaint four years ago

601
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,679
um against meta in three uh dpas and I

602
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,780
thought it was a nice example to walk

603
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,539
you through what we have to go through

604
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,179
every day to enforce the gdpr you'll see

605
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,000
it's not a walk in the park

606
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,919
and I hope that I'm not gonna lose you

607
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,080
in all the details but I try to make a

608
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,280
story of what we did so 25th of May 2018

609
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,480
knob is fighting three complaints

610
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,340
against meta one in Belgium against

611
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,559
Instagram another one in Germany against

612
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,380
WhatsApp another one against

613
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,980
um

614
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,880
I'm losing my Facebook in Austria

615
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,640
for the same thing just because meta

616
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,140
group was not using the data on any

617
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,880
appropriate legal basis basically they

618
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,140
were just using the data for something

619
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,260
that we're not supposed to use them for

620
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,659
that's the basic complaint plus they

621
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,580
were using a lot of other data for other

622
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,500
purposes that were not really clear in

623
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,200
the gdpr just remember that it's we can

624
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,700
basically divide the complain in three

625
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,880
categories they use the data for

626
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,679
personalized advertising second they

627
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,919
were using sensitive data like or sexual

628
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,080
orientation and other sensitive data and

629
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,059
then we're using other data sharing data

630
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:52,919
cookies pixel and everything these three

631
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,260
categories right remember that

632
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,500
that's what we did for years

633
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,779
almost five years ago

634
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,480
that's already like laughable

635
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,700
um we fight three complaints Belgium

636
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,400
Austria Germany Germany and Austria

637
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,980
answered to us in German wow you would

638
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,679
see it's logical no Belgium answer to us

639
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,779
in English as you know about English is

640
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,120
an official language in Belgium right so

641
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,059
that's what the problems began so oh

642
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,460
sorry so first first problem that we

643
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,960
were encountering was the use of

644
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,940
languages in this jurisdiction so we go

645
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,860
to Germany in Austria make sense or

646
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,500
Germany German language go to Belgium

647
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
you would expect Dutch uh German why not

648
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,419
French no it's English why not English

649
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,220
like the answer from the Belgian

650
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,440
Authority is like we we can see that you

651
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,779
use English on your website so you can

652
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,760
speak English because obviously Facebook

653
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,500
cannot speak English right or cannot

654
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,640
speak French because they don't have the

655
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,279
meaning resources to speak French so

656
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,659
that's the first problem that we

657
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,340
encounter in these complaints the use of

658
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,380
languages which is totally not harmonize

659
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,500
let me go through the park with you

660
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,679
second problem that we

661
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,299
encountered it's all these files went to

662
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,520
the Irish DPC you heard about the DPC

663
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,460
normal they don't do nothing but they

664
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,220
all went to the DPC the Irish regulator

665
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,380
to which is the lead Authority in this

666
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,880
case

667
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,059
um we were contacted sometimes directly

668
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,539
by the DPC sometime through the national

669
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,580
Regulators so the German the Belgium and

670
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,760
the Austrian to ask things to know are

671
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,320
you here are you happy wherever you want

672
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,600
to see my submission something always in

673
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,679
English

674
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,960
through the DPC always in English in

675
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,779
Belgium in in German in Germany and in

676
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,580
Germany in Austria still makes sense to

677
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,440
you not for me

678
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,520
um

679
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,640
we ask an access to the file the access

680
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,460
to the file was denied in Germany was

681
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,799
denied in Belgium and we it was granted

682
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,320
in Austria why I don't know it seemed

683
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,820
that some harmonization is needed there

684
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,220
as well of course rln always refused the

685
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,900
access to the file it's just the

686
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,820
beginning of the journey let me turn the

687
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,600
page

688
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,140
no we received a first

689
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,779
and it's not a joke the DPC is following

690
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,240
what they call a six-step procedure

691
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,400
there is nothing in Irish administrative

692
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,440
law just say that with six step

693
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,659
procedure it can be 15 it can be three

694
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,240
it's just made up by the DPC itself so

695
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,460
they they kind of to have a procedure in

696
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,919
Ireland to to have kind of a procedure

697
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,240
in Irish law

698
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,580
nobody heard about that but they that's

699
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,799
the way they do it so first thing in

700
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,679
July they started inquiry by an

701
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,520
inspector in the DPC they issued a first

702
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,919
let me it's they call it uh draft

703
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
inquiry report we were heard on that so

704
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,380
we had the right to submit our uh

705
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,559
submission guess what we received a

706
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,620
report uh translated machine translated

707
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,799
in Germany and in Austria in German we

708
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,600
received it in English in Belgium

709
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,820
because again English is obviously an

710
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,260
official language in Belgium which is

711
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,380
first thing that I heard ever

712
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,940
uh we answered this uh inquiry report

713
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,740
notably saying that guys there were

714
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,600
three categories of requests in our

715
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,400
original complaints and you already

716
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,279
addressed one of those then the way you

717
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,840
process the data for personalized

718
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,700
advertising where is the sensitive data

719
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,320
where the cookie where where are the

720
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,539
investigation going it's too narrow can

721
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,100
you please and we asked that to the

722
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,860
Austrian the German and the Belgium DPA

723
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,659
expand the scope of the investigation

724
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,760
it's not the complaint as we drafted it

725
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,279
one year ago this is too too narrow the

726
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,440
scope is too narrow the DPC narrow the

727
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,380
scope of the investigation Belgium

728
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,080
Austria sorry Belgium and Germany say we

729
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,980
can't do anything we're not

730
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,820
investigating Austrian DPA

731
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,559
Linux signed a letter asking formally to

732
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,240
the DPC to expand the scope of the

733
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,159
investigation saying that knob is Right

734
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,799
use scope is too narrow it was four

735
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,740
years ago you will see when I'm going

736
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,380
tpcc no it's not the scope it's not the

737
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,700
way I read you complaint but that's the

738
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,820
way I wrote it so I think I know no DPC

739
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,080
doesn't want to follow the scope of

740
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,480
Investigation okay fine

741
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,240
we reached the point of the inquiry

742
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,299
report when we had the opportunity again

743
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:19,679
to submit our submission to ddpc Via the

744
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,899
German and Austrian Authority in German

745
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:25,080
and via the Belgium Authority in

746
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,600
and you follow that's fine it still

747
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,700
makes sense right I'm just trying not to

748
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,799
to lose you

749
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,200
um so we asked the the to broaden the

750
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,399
scope of the investigation it was denied

751
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:39,960
uh nothing in the gdpr said that the

752
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,640
lead Authority has to investigate and

753
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,620
only the lead Authority like the DPC in

754
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,380
this case Austrian German and Belgian

755
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,480
DPA never wanted to broaden the scope of

756
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
the investigation and we saw that this

757
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,039
last report of the inspector of the DPC

758
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,720
was still narrowing the scope of our

759
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,539
complaint only focusing on the legal

760
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,360
basis to process the data

761
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,820
we now reached the interesting point of

762
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,940
the listen to that carefully the

763
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,419
preliminary draft decision of the DPC

764
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,460
Helen Dixon so it's not a tough decision

765
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,980
it's a preliminary trough decision we

766
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,779
are reaching the step three of the

767
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,600
procedure here almost there it was two

768
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,080
years and a half ago so we received a

769
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,760
preliminary draft decision uh of Dixon

770
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,440
asking which kind of submission we could

771
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,260
say honestly we just say guys just read

772
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,640
what we already wrote twice because

773
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
we're not going to go there we're not

774
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,640
going to machine translate it another

775
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,159
time it's 200 pages of submission and

776
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,899
nothing changed in your inquiry report

777
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,299
so please refer to what we already

778
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,159
submitted before there is nothing new to

779
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,480
add because apparently you don't want to

780
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,860
broaden escape you don't want to address

781
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,840
our arguments we're not going to go

782
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,740
there

783
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,260
find Helen Dixon is saying I'm Gonna

784
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,140
Know issue my draft decisions like cool

785
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,600
we're reaching fourth uh the step four

786
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,600
of the decision making process of the

787
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,620
Irish law totally made up again

788
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,600
where we were asked to provide our

789
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,659
comments uh

790
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,600
no sorry when we ask to received after

791
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
the draft decision to receive the reason

792
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,039
objection that were raised by the other

793
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,220
authorities against the decision for

794
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,960
those who doesn't know that we don't

795
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,880
know the lead Authority in this case the

796
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,000
Irish DPA has to reach an agreement with

797
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,880
all the other dpas to adopt the decision

798
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,600
uh and if one DPA only or at least

799
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,299
disagree they have to go to the EPB to

800
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,520
have a binding decision which what which

801
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,840
is what happened

802
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,380
the DPC answered uh since we were not

803
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,580
supposed to have access to the

804
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,380
information

805
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,059
um and so that there was no way for us

806
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,500
to have access to the original objection

807
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,399
we went to the Norwegian DPA just as a

808
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,520
reminder the Norwegian DPA is not even a

809
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,980
DPA when we were active to ask whether

810
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,899
we could receive the recent objection of

811
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,200
the Norwegian DBA lucky for Lucky us the

812
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,419
the Norwegian law is more open when it

813
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,860
comes to access requests and they

814
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,260
provided us with the recent objection of

815
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,080
the Norwegian DPA criticizing quite

816
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,720
strongly the draft decision of the DPC

817
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,000
so we had access through another DPA

818
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,860
when we never had contact with

819
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,720
through document that we should have in

820
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,039
the first place in my opinion have

821
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,320
access to in the National procedure do

822
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,700
you follow me so we go in another

823
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,580
country to have access to documents that

824
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,380
we should access in Belgium Germany and

825
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,539
Austria that what happened

826
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,240
we went online which is went public with

827
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
this document there was a sahu first on

828
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,740
the internet about publication of the

829
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,600
document that we receive in the course

830
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,159
of the procedure

831
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,440
since the DPC didn't like the fact that

832
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,659
we just issued this kind of document and

833
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,220
published the document when we asked

834
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,200
another access to the file

835
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,360
the DPC say guys you have the

836
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,460
fundamental right to be heard but we

837
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,080
consider it's appropriate that in this

838
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,820
case you would not have it because you

839
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
were really behaving very bad lately you

840
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,960
were just publishing this decision like

841
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,880
but we were the right yeah maybe but

842
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,740
it's not cool to do so so you would not

843
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,080
have access to the file nice that's fine

844
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,599
never saw that like so Facebook have a

845
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,520
full access to the file menu since you

846
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,500
decided to publish this document on your

847
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,899
website you will be you will have this

848
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,580
right denied and you will not be heard

849
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,139
except

850
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,659
and be prepared if you signed a

851
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,199
non-disclosure agreement with me

852
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,239
so

853
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
yeah I hope it's funny because I was I

854
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,960
didn't know whether I had to cry or not

855
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,619
I never saw it in my life

856
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:39,599
of course we say sure we're gonna find

857
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,300
we're gonna sign an NDA with you to have

858
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,339
access to our file which is a

859
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,560
fundamental right basically we just say

860
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,320
sorry we don't do that okay you're not

861
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,179
going to have access to the file but

862
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,280
Facebook doesn't have to sign an NDA but

863
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,899
it will have access to the file because

864
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,359
Facebook they are good guys knob is bad

865
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,099
guys we publish the documents on our

866
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,540
website

867
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,880
okay fine so since we don't have access

868
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,380
to the file we don't have any submission

869
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,960
to do right so there is nothing to do

870
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm trying to be brief I guess that's

871
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,060
why uh that's why I wanted to have a

872
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,579
nice fun story

873
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,460
um the fact we were informed by the DPC

874
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,460
and the other dpas that the file was

875
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,320
then sent to the dpb because it was

876
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,780
quite obvious that it was a disagreement

877
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,359
between the dpas

878
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,420
um and the file the trust if I did not

879
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,160
mistaken the draft decision reached the

880
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,260
adpv right it's what it's called a ddpb

881
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,839
it's step five I guess or six we don't

882
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,280
know like it's one of the six steps

883
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,820
reach the edpb for a final decision by

884
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,500
the member of the dpb guess what the DPC

885
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,880
organized the right to be heard for

886
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,420
Facebook before going to a dpb neub not

887
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,640
really not really impacted by our

888
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,000
complaint I guess uh adpb is adopting a

889
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,560
decision we're quite pleased with some

890
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,440
of the result of the decision the edpb

891
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,720
decided that the right to be heard does

892
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,460
not apply to the complainant because we

893
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,920
are not affected by the decision of the

894
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,020
dpb so basically ddpb thinks that the

895
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,720
complainant is not affected by the

896
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,480
decision that is going to be taking

897
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,960
about our complaint

898
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,579
interesting as well to hear

899
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,520
edpb is informing the DPC that the DPC

900
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,859
has to change the decision because guess

901
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,560
what the DPC disagree with us it turns

902
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,079
out that other colleagues of ddpc

903
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,820
disagree with the DPC so they have to

904
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,119
change the decision and guess what EDP

905
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,820
is asking the DPC to broaden the scope

906
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,180
of the investigation what a surprise we

907
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,820
were asking for that for four years

908
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,800
um but no maybe you've heard it but it's

909
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,900
not a problem the DPC notes challenged

910
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,420
the rights and the powers for gdpb to

911
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,040
broaden the scope so we'll see where

912
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,880
we're going and I wanted to remind you

913
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,579
of the three categories of requests that

914
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,320
you had in the beginning so this

915
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,260
personalized advertising the sensitive

916
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,560
data and the rest so so far personalized

917
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,960
advertising is kind of address by ddpb

918
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,960
in the DPC decision sensitive data DPC

919
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,579
say I don't want to investigate in that

920
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,740
I decided to narrow the scope of the

921
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,260
investigation it's up to me authority to

922
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,720
read the complaint as I see fit

923
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,300
and the rest of the data still don't

924
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,740
know where it's going so even the

925
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,260
Belgian DPA the DPC no one investigated

926
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,839
it so where are we now we receive from

927
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:33,900
the German the Austrian and the Belgian

928
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,980
Authority

929
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,500
the copy of the decision of the DPC

930
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,940
because that's what they have to do

931
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,640
Under the gdpr they have to communicate

932
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,020
with the complaint and the final

933
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,119
decision reached by the lead Authority

934
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,400
in this case the DPC

935
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,500
funny fact and it's the last one that I

936
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,720
want to share if you win your case

937
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,540
completely you just informed by The

938
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,099
Authority when you filed a complaint

939
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,079
that you want the case this is the copy

940
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,339
of the decision

941
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,780
since you don't have to challenge this

942
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,400
because you want right it makes sense so

943
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
you're just informed if you complain has

944
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,680
been fully or partially rejected

945
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,440
by The Authority then they have to adopt

946
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,720
two decision the DPC has to adopt one

947
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,119
decision and the authority when you file

948
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,800
a complaint is to adopt another decision

949
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,740
rejecting part of your complaint and

950
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,599
this decision you can appeal it in front

951
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,180
of the court guess what we received on

952
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,740
the Belgium the Austrian and the German

953
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,680
authorities and in for an email

954
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,140
informing us that it was a decision

955
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,320
but they never took a position about

956
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,780
whether our complaint was partially

957
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,480
rejected or totally accepted

958
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,160
so that's another problem that we had

959
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,980
and last point of course guess in which

960
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,780
language this decision was addressed to

961
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,300
us by the Belgian Authority

962
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,240
in English as well so we now have to

963
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,940
appeal a decision from the Belgian

964
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,339
Authority in English before the court of

965
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:57,599
appeal

966
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,000
that and I so no solution in my little

967
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,339
speech and my little funny speech but I

968
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,500
want to I wanted to walk you through the

969
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,359
Journey of a complaint which just took

970
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,220
us five years

971
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,160
who has been addressed at in 15 of our

972
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,680
complaint with a lot of procedural issue

973
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,780
that maybe we will solve in 30 minutes

974
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,839
today but I hope you see how it's a

975
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,540
struggle still to enforce the gdpr from

976
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,180
the complainant side

977
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,579
thank you thank you thank you very much

978
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,920
I hope hope you you can feel a little

979
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,280
bit the vertigo of this procedural gaps

980
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,980
and problems perhaps to situate this it

981
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,079
can help there are I think two big sets

982
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,339
of questions so there are issues about

983
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,099
the cooperation inside the dpb inside

984
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,380
the One-Stop shop many question marks

985
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,599
there how does this cooperation work but

986
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,040
there are also still fundamental

987
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,960
questions about the procedure related to

988
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,900
a complaint as such to which extent is a

989
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,079
DPA obliged to investigate everything in

990
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,119
your complaint can they be a bit

991
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,820
selective not can they say interesting I

992
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,040
handle this by putting it here but I

993
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,020
have a different investigation there are

994
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,220
different interpretations in different

995
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,480
member states about this very

996
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,700
fundamental questions about what does it

997
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,740
mean to have a right to launch a

998
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,599
complaint to which extent do they have

999
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,420
to follow with this so you

1000
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,700
combine this problems of cooperation

1001
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,140
with the other problems of fundamental

1002
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,000
questions we have a lot of trouble

1003
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,760
potentially but Maria will explain this

1004
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,220
better yeah thanks so much Claudia and

1005
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm very happy to be here and discuss

1006
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,180
this question of gdpr enforcements once

1007
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,079
again I think we're having the

1008
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,200
discussion almost every year and I'll

1009
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,440
try to gather what the previous speakers

1010
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,140
said already and maybe try to identify

1011
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,820
what are the challenges for the future

1012
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,700
that I see here and I think I see at

1013
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,260
least four questions to be asked and

1014
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,560
first one is what's going to happen in

1015
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,599
the text of the gdpr as it is now how

1016
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,700
the GDP how the DPS will approach this

1017
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,500
second is what will be the role of the

1018
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,780
adpb also concerning the meta case that

1019
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,300
Roman just described to us the first

1020
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,760
question is something that didn't wasn't

1021
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,380
mentioned yet and I still want to put

1022
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,359
this on the table it's the how will we

1023
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,060
reconcile the enforcement of gdpr with

1024
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,160
enforcement of all the upcoming new laws

1025
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,920
and also interaction with existing

1026
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,660
regulations that already does exist and

1027
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,880
I will speak about it in a minute and

1028
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,640
the fourth first question is what will

1029
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,099
happen what will we take over from the

1030
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,300
take out from the procedural

1031
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,040
harmonization and what the European

1032
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,960
commission will prepare all right and I

1033
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,060
will just now would like to very briefly

1034
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,920
explain all these four questions on the

1035
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,440
challenges that I see here uh so first

1036
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,660
one is this current text of gdpr and

1037
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,660
what happens next and I see here three

1038
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,660
potential issues that are I think some

1039
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,920
of them are quite easy to be fixed so

1040
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,660
there's not and the first thing is what

1041
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,760
Lizette was also describing and Romeo

1042
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,579
and Glendale you are all mentioning how

1043
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,740
the dpas cooperate with each other and I

1044
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,440
think it's on the dpas now much has hard

1045
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,760
it is and I know that they are very

1046
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,140
overwhelmed with their work uh to take

1047
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,480
this obligation to cooperate loyally and

1048
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,920
sincerely seriously and by that I mean

1049
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,060
using the mechanisms that are already

1050
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,940
there in the gdpr

1051
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,220
formal and informal and Joint operations

1052
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,800
all of this it's already there and even

1053
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,359
testing it and acknowledging that some

1054
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:21,300
of it will won't work some of it will

1055
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,160
take an effect just trying these

1056
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,380
procedures the Urgent procedures and all

1057
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,800
of that because already there and for

1058
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,540
now we were talking Roma was presenting

1059
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,460
the big case The Meta case that took so

1060
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,619
many years but all the other cases of

1061
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,180
the there are tons of cases that were

1062
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,859
already issues on the One-Stop shop

1063
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,599
mechanisms but only some of them end

1064
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,060
with uh very strict corrective measures

1065
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,859
like most of them are going to endic

1066
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,680
with referee demands the best so why is

1067
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,079
that like artists artists violations

1068
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:53,160
somehow uh less

1069
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,000
a strict like the these controllers they

1070
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,440
are just facing repriments for the

1071
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,599
evaluation and it's much easier to find

1072
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,579
a controller that is based in one

1073
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,760
country than several member states uh so

1074
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,319
it's something to be done it's it's

1075
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,240
possible to do this now but it's

1076
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,920
connected to another issue of the

1077
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,280
resources and I hear it every time when

1078
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,780
you have this discussion that it's a

1079
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,579
fact the Pas are on the resource under

1080
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,579
staff they don't have much capacity even

1081
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,319
to do this because they are working on

1082
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,960
National cases they are already

1083
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,400
overwhelmed with the obligations that

1084
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,960
are saying from National laws and then

1085
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,940
they have this layer of EU cooperation

1086
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,220
mechanism and I understand that it's a

1087
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,640
lot so I I think it's time to face it as

1088
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,380
a structural problem rather than

1089
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,200
individual problem of the hdpa and maybe

1090
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,000
instead of introducing yet another

1091
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,300
provision that DPA needs to be needs to

1092
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,000
have sufficient budgets maybe we can try

1093
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,740
to think of another Solutions maybe

1094
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,020
decentralizing or centralizing some some

1095
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,680
levels of enforcement uh maybe adding

1096
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
some flexibility around appointment of

1097
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,460
the leading supervisory Authority I

1098
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,960
think there's some fields to play with

1099
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,000
and think of it how to tackle this issue

1100
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,579
but just don't wait for member states to

1101
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,260
finance the uh the dpas because

1102
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,180
sometimes we need to acknowledge it

1103
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,859
won't happen and some of them are using

1104
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,079
this as an excuse sometimes the fact and

1105
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,440
the first week is something that we as

1106
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,000
academics and both ngos are voicing from

1107
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,859
the very beginning we need more

1108
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,839
transparency and I'm very happy to hear

1109
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,960
uh from gwendal and I we see that edpb

1110
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,900
is becoming more and more open but still

1111
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,579
I think there is a lot to be done

1112
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,680
so we know what happens after filing a

1113
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,540
complain how to file a complaint we did

1114
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,020
the study uh last year about that uh how

1115
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,540
to so so we as Dr subjects we should

1116
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,760
know what will happen which dpas will

1117
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,619
have amicable settlements which dpas

1118
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,599
will have like what deadlines even this

1119
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,980
kind of fact so it should be accessible

1120
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,220
and I'm glad to hear that edpd EDP is

1121
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,800
working on that and moreover like on

1122
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,540
just my smaller request please update

1123
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,420
the the data database on the website of

1124
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,859
One Stop Shop decisions because I think

1125
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,800
there's still only 250 decisions that

1126
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,660
are there and maybe also clarifying the

1127
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,760
rules of publication like why some of

1128
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,079
them are published why not it's it's

1129
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,540
still uncrew so these are these three

1130
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,740
main issues when it comes to the current

1131
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,140
tax of gdpr then we go to the role of

1132
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,020
the EPB so and there's a lot of

1133
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,520
developments there first is something

1134
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,859
like Wendell was mentioning uh and it's

1135
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:21,720
excellent that the edpb also is trying

1136
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,280
to cooperate outside of One Stop Shop

1137
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,319
mechanism so the core coordinated

1138
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,359
enforcement framework the pool of

1139
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,220
experts these are excellent Solutions

1140
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,040
and I'm also glad to hear the the soft

1141
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,720
flow and the role of guidelines here

1142
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,960
although I knew you mentioned that you

1143
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,760
are working to harm on harmonizing the

1144
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,380
compliance filing but it's also a fact

1145
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,800
that edpb can't introduce the fall the

1146
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,020
whole procedure via guidelines because

1147
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,640
it's just a soft flow it's not binding

1148
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,640
so uh and there's the whole discussion

1149
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,579
in ulo in general about the role of that

1150
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:55,859
and then coming by coming to The Meta

1151
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:57,420
cases and this recent decision of the

1152
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,240
edpb I think it's clear from what Roman

1153
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,060
was saying uh that's something that we

1154
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,540
already this observed that this

1155
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,520
cooperation mechanism that it should be

1156
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,980
among equal parts is in fact about uh

1157
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,680
there is this very privileged entirety

1158
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,060
there in this leading supervisor

1159
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,920
Authority in the case in this cases it

1160
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,380
was Ireland

1161
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,000
which has a great influence of how much

1162
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,060
they will share with other authorities

1163
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,500
and how much information they will

1164
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,040
provide whether they will include the

1165
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,260
other authorities and the parties into

1166
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,940
investigation whether they can even

1167
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,880
limit the scope of the investigations

1168
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,800
and as a result the other concern

1169
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,540
supervisor authorities they don't know

1170
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,700
what the case was about and then they

1171
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,440
have when they when this case finally

1172
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,119
reaches this point of the draft decision

1173
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,040
that the last stage they have only one

1174
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,020
month to decide on the case that's

1175
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,020
really not a lot to understand all the

1176
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,579
facts and the uh of the legal and

1177
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,560
effects of the case

1178
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,020
and it has an effect especially when the

1179
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,700
authority limited the scope of the

1180
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,640
investigation so these are Big questions

1181
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,560
that are going to be asked soon and I'm

1182
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,060
very curious about the outcome of the

1183
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,579
DPC

1184
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:13,140
the destruction against adpb decisions

1185
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,720
because we need to answer whether could

1186
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,880
DDP demand further investigation from

1187
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,240
their dpas could DPC limit the scope of

1188
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,819
the investigation and also what is the

1189
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:25,920
discretion that the DPA have when they

1190
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,720
are

1191
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,400
they are waiting for the the ntp

1192
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,920
decision so here actually what happened

1193
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,160
the edpb for example they asked the PA

1194
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,160
to erase the the amount of a fine and

1195
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,079
the DPC did this but still the fine

1196
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,660
wasn't satisfactory let's say for some

1197
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,240
of the other dpas so it's like what can

1198
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,260
be done taken out of the decision and

1199
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,780
then another question that I think needs

1200
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,579
to be addressed is also the procedural

1201
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,680
rights it will still developing and I

1202
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,619
will to just mention here this order

1203
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:00,960
that was issued recently against the

1204
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,339
water the WhatsApp annulment case so

1205
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,440
WhatsApp appealed against edpb decision

1206
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,839
and the coach of Justice said that it's

1207
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,880
impossible for WhatsApp to appeal

1208
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,260
against such a decision because it's not

1209
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,140
a party of this case and I think what

1210
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,420
this case shows us is the whole problem

1211
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,160
with this procedure and the composite

1212
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,720
procedures in the EU in general because

1213
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,359
there is no code to review the the

1214
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,280
entirety of these procedures we have the

1215
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,079
national courts in the for the national

1216
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,180
decisions and then we have the the

1217
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,940
European court of justice that is uh

1218
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,859
responsible for edpv decisions but there

1219
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,839
is no entirety to actually cover all the

1220
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:38,640
steps of the procedure in a way that

1221
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,339
would be satisfactory for the parties

1222
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:42,780
and I think there's a growing literature

1223
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,040
on that already because it's not only

1224
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,480
question of the data protection

1225
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,160
enforcement and it's something I think

1226
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,960
that also we should bear in mind that uh

1227
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
these are lessons that we can learn from

1228
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,240
other fields of law uh finally the first

1229
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,760
the first Parts is that something that I

1230
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,099
mentioned so we had this first AG

1231
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,319
opinion so far cooperation with other

1232
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,500
sectors uh it's still not mentioned but

1233
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,060
I think it will be a growing problem I

1234
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,160
wish I'm finishing just two two more

1235
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,839
points so it will be a growing problem

1236
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,119
there is no framework whatsoever on how

1237
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,859
the dpas and for example competition

1238
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,500
authorities should cooperate and it's

1239
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,540
clear especially in this the way this

1240
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,940
world operates now and how that are

1241
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,740
involved in almost all every sector it

1242
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,079
will be a growing issue so the question

1243
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:27,240
is now what are we going to do this and

1244
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,160
how the commission will Design uh the

1245
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,079
new procedure and I'm sure that they

1246
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,460
will some issues will be addressed

1247
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,319
especially the ones that already ngos

1248
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,000
and dpas are mentioning so the

1249
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,680
procedural arrives I hope that the

1250
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,859
timeline will be unified the the scope

1251
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,839
of the complaint should be clarified the

1252
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,000
meaning like the position of the parties

1253
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,359
I I hope it will be addressed and I hope

1254
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,400
that the commission and later when we

1255
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,740
will be debating this take lessons from

1256
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,280
other areas of law uh so how it's not

1257
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,319
only going into for example centralized

1258
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,119
model or decentralized models just

1259
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,220
taking from all the different models

1260
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,380
that were there and seeing what works

1261
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,060
what has not and maybe it will work for

1262
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,300
the gdpr I hope so just to sum up maybe

1263
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,220
still like there are a lot of hopes

1264
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,079
among the commission proposal coming

1265
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,300
soon

1266
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,560
but I still don't think it will solve

1267
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,880
the issue because actually the problem

1268
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,460
here is not only the lack of Regulation

1269
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,260
or all these discrepancies that are here

1270
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,119
that the fact that we need to reconcile

1271
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,060
the laws and so on it's also the I think

1272
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,460
that the the intrinsic perspective of

1273
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,980
how the dpsc they work and I think that

1274
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,960
there are some cultural disagreements

1275
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,940
sometimes they are just simply seeing

1276
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,160
some of them are more on the seeing

1277
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,720
themselves as Regulators or they're like

1278
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,339
more on boots on I think it's quite

1279
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,880
clear in this uh disagreements that they

1280
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,220
have that and it's not that easy to

1281
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,720
regulate this because it's obvious that

1282
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,740
they have different goals different

1283
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,960
political agendas so there is a question

1284
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,720
on how to reconcile this to um and how

1285
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,059
to provide good conflict handling

1286
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:00,260
mechanism yeah so thanks

1287
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,660
thank you very much I hope you all wish

1288
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,339
to react to everybody I don't know if

1289
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:08,040
you've really wish to react immediately

1290
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,619
or we can just check if there will be

1291
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,720
questions because then I'm happy to open

1292
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,400
the for questions that's the probability

1293
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,339
number one and I see one volunteer to

1294
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:19,920
just break the ice please

1295
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,079
can you identify yourself so we know who

1296
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,680
you are please

1297
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,000
do you need a microphone Maybe

1298
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,460
sorry

1299
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,780
hello I'm Michel I work for the European

1300
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,359
Parliament uh thanks for an excellent

1301
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,900
presentation and I think Romania should

1302
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,240
start to look for a publisher to publish

1303
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,359
your adventures you know in a book form

1304
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,180
um I have I have however a small

1305
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,480
complaint to you Gloria me as a moderate

1306
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,339
you have no right to complain to speak

1307
00:51:56,339 --> 00:51:59,480
another moderator only with DPA

1308
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,119
because the title of this panel is great

1309
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,119
but how exactly and so far I heard

1310
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:08,640
answers to the questions but what

1311
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,880
exactly so people mentioned deadlines

1312
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,920
exchange of information

1313
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,220
procedure to reach consensus but I

1314
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,480
didn't hear an answer to the question

1315
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,359
how to

1316
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:22,859
basically ensure a procedural

1317
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,220
harmonization I think

1318
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,160
Wendell mentioned come come commission

1319
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,579
committed to produce some kind of

1320
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:35,040
procedure Maria was quite

1321
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,480
straightforward that there will be a new

1322
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,480
legislation so probably you know a bit

1323
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,700
or the the panelists know a bit more

1324
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,599
than I know myself so my question is how

1325
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,319
exactly and and there are basically I

1326
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,540
see two options just to just finish one

1327
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,700
is the one is legislation but then on

1328
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,579
what on which legal basis so we have

1329
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:59,579
here subsidiarity uh principle uh

1330
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,079
administrative procedure is the

1331
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,700
competence of member states this is not

1332
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,359
a EU competence other option I see I got

1333
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:08,880
are guidelines or uh some kind I don't

1334
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,859
know of communication but then it would

1335
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,980
be non-binding uh for member states so

1336
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:17,460
yeah I I I I'm sure Mario literally

1337
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,020
mentioned new legislation so so

1338
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,839
basically yeah that's my question how

1339
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,420
how it can be achieved good so because

1340
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,079
you complain to me I I will just say

1341
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,579
there is nothing is my phone there's a

1342
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,140
photo of the European commission they

1343
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,220
were supposed to be here but they

1344
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,780
couldn't they wanted to be here but they

1345
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,700
couldn't so we're gonna ask them this

1346
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,220
question but indeed I I think this is

1347
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,960
the question where we think something

1348
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,420
will be proposed at some point what

1349
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,880
exactly I don't know I think it is not

1350
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,440
true that this cannot be harmonized I

1351
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,300
mean the gdpr is supposed to harmonize

1352
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,280
the process you have to wrote a

1353
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,720
complaint there must be a procedure

1354
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,059
actually that follows up this so I'm not

1355
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:56,460
sure it cannot it's not harmonizable uh

1356
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,319
to the extent that you need this

1357
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,359
organization to make this real and if

1358
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,460
it's not harmonized it's not real I

1359
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,920
think it is actually possible but I

1360
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,079
think the speakers should yeah just

1361
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:09,119
maybe just explain myself yeah maybe it

1362
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,760
was more of my wish and yeah I don't

1363
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,859
know what commission is planning to do

1364
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,980
uh but I also believe

1365
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,380
uh that we will face this necessity to

1366
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,780
actually introduce something at least

1367
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,540
until like at least legally binding and

1368
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,880
uh if not now than in the previous year

1369
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,819
and also in in the view of this com

1370
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:31,800
regulations that are coming up soon and

1371
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,359
when it comes to the legal basis I think

1372
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,140
it's still feasible to do this to this

1373
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,660
very narrow scope that relates to gdpr

1374
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,260
enforcement at least I think but um I

1375
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,760
wonder what maybe

1376
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,180
yeah well I I think in in the

1377
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,680
commission's agenda it was actually

1378
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,599
mentioned at the end of the year that

1379
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,119
the commission intends to adopt a

1380
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,700
legislative act and what kind of

1381
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,559
instrument that is going to be I have no

1382
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,780
idea but maybe you know more about that

1383
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,599
I assume that that is going to be a

1384
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,819
regulation as I think that either in

1385
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:08,579
implementing or delegated act would be

1386
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,440
um it would go too far and be too

1387
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,319
complex too and Technical to to adopt

1388
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:15,119
such a decision

1389
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,700
um and yeah regarding the legal basis I

1390
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,480
think

1391
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,240
I I don't think that there are many

1392
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,099
problems with that in the sense that

1393
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:26,040
data protection is protected in primary

1394
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,780
EU law in article 16 of the teu and it's

1395
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,460
describes and actually wrote it down

1396
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,099
that the EU has the competence to lay

1397
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,619
down the rules to protect data and I

1398
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,359
think that doesn't necessarily exclude

1399
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,579
the possibility to lay down procedural

1400
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,619
rules instead of only substantive rules

1401
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,780
in a sense that the gdpr already does so

1402
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,540
but it is not super detailed and then

1403
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,940
there is of course also the more broader

1404
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,240
legal basis in article 114 of the tfu

1405
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,059
regulating the internal Market but also

1406
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:00,960
article 298 of the tfu could probably be

1407
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,599
considered where the union has the

1408
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,059
competence to ensure that there is an

1409
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,300
efficient Union Administration and then

1410
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,099
we have to of course speak about what a

1411
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:13,559
union Administration is but I think it

1412
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,059
could be argued that a union

1413
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:18,119
Administration today includes also the

1414
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:20,099
national administrations and is

1415
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,380
integrated Administration that we have

1416
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,480
and there's also the flexibility Clause

1417
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,540
of course at the end of the the tfvu

1418
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,339
which I think would be difficult because

1419
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,920
it requires consensus in the council but

1420
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,619
or unanimity in the council but I think

1421
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:36,480
there are many possibilities and it's

1422
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,040
very interesting to see what the

1423
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,940
commission is coming up with in 2023 I'm

1424
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,040
not sure whether that will be soon at

1425
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,160
the beginning of the year or later but

1426
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,619
any

1427
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:51,059
ideas on how exactly this is going to

1428
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,579
happen no okay I see another question

1429
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:55,079
are there more questions that we can

1430
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,680
take a few questions together no only

1431
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,380
one question please identify yourself

1432
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,660
thank you I still have reluctance about

1433
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,280
not being allowed to ask anonymous

1434
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,319
question at the Privacy camp but you can

1435
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:09,780
identify yourself in a just to we know

1436
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,819
more or less more or less vaguely who

1437
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,220
you are but my name is

1438
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,740
um my question is in this kind of

1439
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,579
following from this discussion is to

1440
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,460
what extent may this lead to the gdpr

1441
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,619
becoming a backdoor to a harmonizing

1442
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,540
administrative law across the European

1443
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,720
Union

1444
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,540
um

1445
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,540
because you will harmonize this

1446
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,220
procedural procedures related to data

1447
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,380
protection will be then open the door to

1448
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,859
other administrative law harmonization

1449
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:46,200
the interesting

1450
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,599
am I

1451
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,940
I think that's a very sensitive topic

1452
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,920
and of course this was already initiated

1453
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,140
by the Parliament and it was on the on

1454
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,640
their wish list

1455
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,960
um but I think it's a very interesting

1456
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,000
point because if you start to harmonize

1457
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,160
procedures under the gdpr that will

1458
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,559
certainly or mostly affect countries

1459
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,180
that have these General administrative

1460
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,920
law acts like the Netherlands and

1461
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,640
Luxembourg and Austria and so it means

1462
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,200
that those General administrative law

1463
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,220
acts will have to be set aside

1464
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,740
in particular areas which makes it even

1465
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,440
well it makes it likely that it could

1466
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,300
also happen in other areas or not likely

1467
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,359
but easier and I I think and that was

1468
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,339
also I forgot to mention with the legal

1469
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,480
basis

1470
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,099
um interesting to look at case law from

1471
00:58:32,099 --> 00:58:33,599
the court of justice because I think

1472
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,319
especially in this principle of good

1473
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,520
governance and the rights of the defense

1474
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,740
there are many links to be found in case

1475
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,900
law that actually applies to National

1476
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,760
administrations when they are acting in

1477
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,200
the scope of EU law so you don't even

1478
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,760
need to Charter for that you can just

1479
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,400
look to case law and see many links and

1480
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,680
hooks there which could be form a basis

1481
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,480
for such a general administrative law

1482
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,420
act at Union level for which the gdpr

1483
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,280
could maybe be a first step

1484
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:04,079
I'm not sure this is reassuring or not

1485
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,299
reassuring at all

1486
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:07,140
um I don't know if there are more

1487
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,280
questions in the meantime I was thinking

1488
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,200
actually for the for the legal basis I

1489
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,880
think it can be also a question for just

1490
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,799
access to Justice in the sense that now

1491
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:15,900
there is such a big situation when you

1492
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,640
launch a complaint that you never know

1493
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,280
really if that was successfully handled

1494
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,980
by the by the DPA or not you never know

1495
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,799
when you can go to article 78 and take

1496
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:28,220
them to court I think eventually

1497
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,140
might want to take somebody to court but

1498
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,660
he's forever waiting for this sort of

1499
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,119
new reply I think many people are in

1500
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:37,559
this situation and you can say well if

1501
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,480
this takes forever the things are lost

1502
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,700
in one sub shop and then there's a

1503
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,859
problem of access to to test this or if

1504
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,359
you never receive a notification that

1505
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,059
your complaint was effectively rejected

1506
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,440
dismissed

1507
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,220
arguably arguably okay I see another

1508
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,118
question in the meantime

1509
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,440
hello my name is Jessica lapper I'm from

1510
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,819
the Netherlands

1511
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:04,859
um you said something about the general

1512
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:07,619
administrative law acts in the in the

1513
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:10,880
Netherlands I think there must be some

1514
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,599
studies about uh the differences or the

1515
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,480
the similarities of a general

1516
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,940
administrative law in the different

1517
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,119
European countries and What I Hear What

1518
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,140
I Hear About the Irish

1519
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,880
it seems that they don't have a very

1520
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,680
strong uh General administrative law so

1521
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,000
maybe it is

1522
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,180
what they don't have it at all oh that's

1523
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,640
strange because then what what is the

1524
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,480
the right of a citizen is in in in a lot

1525
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,920
of

1526
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,460
um with a lot of

1527
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,859
themes it is very important to have a

1528
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:56,099
general administrative law so it it's

1529
01:00:56,099 --> 01:01:00,000
very interesting subject yeah

1530
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,839
if I make it I I of course I want to be

1531
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:05,339
provocative on purpose but it's true

1532
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,500
like DPC in Ireland it's common law so

1533
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,960
there is no General administrative law

1534
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,220
but it's not the only country where they

1535
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:12,599
don't have such a law but you know what

1536
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,180
I don't care because what we need is

1537
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,220
like people reading the law a lot of DP

1538
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,960
are just denying the fundamental right

1539
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,059
already existing in the national law

1540
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,599
again to be concrete concrete example we

1541
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,579
sued the Swedish GPA because they denied

1542
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,740
us the right to be a party and it's

1543
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,740
written in their National procedure we

1544
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,079
we steal them in court we basically what

1545
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,940
I don't want to wait for procedure

1546
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,500
harmonizational thing really I don't

1547
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,960
have time for this so no really it's

1548
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,760
gonna take two years it's gonna be a

1549
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,380
mess it's going to be like no I don't

1550
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,540
care we fight and we go to court it

1551
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,339
takes a lot of resources it's tiring but

1552
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:50,460
you go to court so Sweden we won at the

1553
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,960
court of appeal as well we are a party

1554
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,000
in Sweden we can force them to adopt a

1555
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,859
decision we did the same in Austria they

1556
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:57,900
denied us the right explicitly written

1557
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,640
in the in their Administrative Code we

1558
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,760
go to court Lord we win no Austrian DP

1559
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,500
knows that we are after them and we are

1560
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,299
just asked for a decision we're going to

1561
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:08,760
do the same in Ireland as well we do the

1562
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,500
same in Luxembourg when you force Delux

1563
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,720
DBA to say we want your administrative

1564
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,220
law to be applicable and they say no

1565
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,319
it's not applicable to me why I don't

1566
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,700
know I'm not sure but I don't want it to

1567
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,380
be applicable okay we go to court and we

1568
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,660
make that's what we do so I think there

1569
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,339
is already a visitative law at a

1570
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,839
national level existing and it was also

1571
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:26,339
the charter of fundamental right article

1572
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:28,619
40 right to good Administration that's

1573
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,480
already a thing access to the file right

1574
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,339
to be heard they are just ignored by the

1575
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:34,440
dbas they don't want to enforce it

1576
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,960
it's it's it's it's easy it's already

1577
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,760
there you don't need another law and

1578
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,559
they just don't want to apply it they

1579
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,960
just they have cold feeds but they give

1580
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,099
the right to be heard to Facebook that's

1581
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,380
not a problem to the complainer not sure

1582
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,180
voila that's what I see

1583
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,160
and it's tiring really that's what I'm a

1584
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,839
little bit upset but maybe

1585
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,240
I I will be more nuanced and more

1586
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,020
balanced uh uh no there's rules in in

1587
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,420
national Administrative laws of course

1588
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,720
with the authorities are are trying to

1589
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,900
implement as best as they can uh and and

1590
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,059
this Gap analysis in the way that you're

1591
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,680
mentioning between the different

1592
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,540
authorities is what we did to come up

1593
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,000
with the wish list I mentioned before we

1594
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,240
said this differences in the way we

1595
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,520
process complaints across the member

1596
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,859
states it can be due to the right to be

1597
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:24,839
heard which is not the same in in all

1598
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,420
the member states it can you be due to

1599
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,000
what we request in the in the when you

1600
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,380
file a complaint things like that

1601
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,240
sometimes there has to be signed

1602
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,920
sometimes it doesn't have to be signed

1603
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,599
for instance if you send this to another

1604
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,839
authority to say who says Ah you send me

1605
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,880
an a complaint in my country it has to

1606
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,559
be signed well there needs to be an

1607
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:45,119
agreement on what the rules are you know

1608
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,819
to make sure that it does not slow down

1609
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:50,819
the process to analyze the complaint so

1610
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:53,099
this is exactly the work that we've been

1611
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:56,000
doing so we we listed basically

1612
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,859
important differences in the procedures

1613
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:01,380
that would need to be clearly ironed out

1614
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,680
in the proposal by the commission that

1615
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,799
they committed to uh to to to to prepare

1616
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:10,140
you need to go to the commission to ask

1617
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,240
a question behind

1618
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,640
um

1619
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,680
and and this is what we hope they can do

1620
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,380
to facilitate the work when we cooperate

1621
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,420
because if you have the same rules if

1622
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,400
you applied the same methodologies if

1623
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,200
you apply the same criteria to decide

1624
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,839
when a complaint is admissible or not if

1625
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,900
it's clear or confirmed sometimes

1626
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,700
because sometimes we have things in in

1627
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,799
guidelines there are soft law and that

1628
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,660
would need to be confirmed more

1629
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,619
explicitly to to be correctly applied

1630
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:42,540
this is identified in what we call this

1631
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,220
wish list which is the letter sent to

1632
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,319
the commission and and we hope that if

1633
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,240
we do this on top of all the initiatives

1634
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,059
we have to harmonize our working methods

1635
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:53,579
uh this is going to improve continue to

1636
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,619
improve the the collaboration between

1637
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:58,680
National authorities

1638
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,140
I just want to Nuance what universe but

1639
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,660
of course that's what we do best

1640
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,520
um first of all and I understand that

1641
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,319
cooperation is important between dpas

1642
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:09,240
and procedural organization is important

1643
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,099
for cooperation my problem is not

1644
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:13,200
cooperation with dpas it's my right as a

1645
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,660
complainant and I'm just afraid that the

1646
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,640
objective of cooperation between dpas

1647
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,020
might be a little bit at the opposite of

1648
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,880
my right to be heard for example because

1649
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,319
if you want to cooperate efficiently

1650
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,240
maybe you don't want to hear all the

1651
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,980
parties because you want to be efficient

1652
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:27,960
that's a little bit the tension that I

1653
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,359
might see second Leones that I would

1654
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,160
like to see it's just and I understand

1655
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,380
it's not really easy but there was a

1656
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,599
study on and I'm happy to share it

1657
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,859
because we made an access request with

1658
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,480
edpb to have access to all the documents

1659
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,940
of the DPS answering to ddpp about how

1660
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,819
is my administrative law working we have

1661
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:46,140
this at Noid

1662
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,420
they usually say something to ddpb but

1663
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,099
trust me and I can just give you cases

1664
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:52,020
just just do the opposite in front of

1665
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,240
the court in the National court so they

1666
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,740
they basically and I don't want to name

1667
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,299
them because I'm going to drop that next

1668
01:05:57,299 --> 01:05:59,819
week in a litigation they say to dpb we

1669
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:02,280
are subject to international law of

1670
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,319
administrative law but to just say the

1671
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,420
opposite in front of the court I want to

1672
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,680
be there my language because I dropped

1673
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,700
this document where they say the

1674
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,619
opposite to the EDP you know so really

1675
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:12,660
trust me I'm not like that not all of

1676
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,880
gpas of course some DPA just deny

1677
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,440
the law to which they are subject and

1678
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,000
they already confirmed to be subject to

1679
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,740
this law even in official documentary

1680
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,400
ddpb so I I just it's tiring just to

1681
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,660
voila that's I'm exhausted but just a a

1682
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,200
quick reaction on on the first point uh

1683
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,760
and

1684
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,220
is also an additional comment on the

1685
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,680
wish list the wish list identifies the

1686
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,319
differences it does not always identify

1687
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:46,140
the best possible solution because of

1688
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,640
course if you have differences in your

1689
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,059
national law uh you will claim that

1690
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:52,680
probably it's best is the best solution

1691
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,599
and you need to stick with that so this

1692
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,460
is why in a way the wish list at least

1693
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,619
on some issues is is pushing the problem

1694
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,079
to to the commission and asking them to

1695
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:02,700
find the solution so we have common

1696
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,920
rules in the future that's the first

1697
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,599
point I wanted to make the second one

1698
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,839
very briefly is about uh the role of

1699
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:13,500
edpb also in harmonization which is uh

1700
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,359
clearly demonstrated I think by the

1701
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,760
example that Roma has been giving where

1702
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,520
there was differences between the

1703
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,920
authorities on important legal Concepts

1704
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,799
in gdpr like this legal basis for

1705
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:27,960
targeted advertising to to make a long

1706
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,740
story short and edpb decides on this and

1707
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,539
creates harmonization Through The

1708
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:36,000
Binding decision so in the dispute

1709
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,220
resolution process there's two important

1710
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,160
points that you see clearly as

1711
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:45,720
complainants first ddpb decides on

1712
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,359
complex legal questions on which

1713
01:07:48,359 --> 01:07:50,880
authorities have been disagree for four

1714
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,400
years in your case at National level and

1715
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,920
we have to solve this in a very limited

1716
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,319
time frame because this there's a

1717
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,359
deadline in the law and the second thing

1718
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:02,640
is the impact also on the corrective

1719
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,559
measures because

1720
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,440
in those cases for instance the final

1721
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,200
find that was adopted by the leader the

1722
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,480
lead Authority was considerably

1723
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,119
increased compared to what was present

1724
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,920
in the draft decision before it was

1725
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,640
submit it to dpb so adpb asked the Irish

1726
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,040
regulator to reassess the amount of the

1727
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,219
file

1728
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:29,900
that I think

1729
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,040
see if the commission is going to look

1730
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,839
at the role of the edpp because I think

1731
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,179
the edpb indeed has a very important

1732
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:39,540
role to play in solving disputes at

1733
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,399
National level but there are also

1734
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,779
especially when you look to other

1735
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:46,620
decision-making bodies at EU level some

1736
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,679
peculiar things about the edpb that

1737
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,259
might make it less efficient than its

1738
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:55,380
potential in the sense that the edpp is

1739
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,420
highly Reliant upon the dpas in

1740
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,219
providing information so if they don't

1741
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,560
receive all the information necessary

1742
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,500
for decision making the edpb can request

1743
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,540
prior to initiating the procedure

1744
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,520
formally further information from the

1745
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,819
dpas but if it

1746
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:12,960
discovers throughout its decision-making

1747
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,759
process that it does not have all the

1748
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,279
information to decide on a case it

1749
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,500
cannot decide so it will simply have to

1750
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,120
conclude that the the facts do not

1751
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,040
show enough evidence for for decision

1752
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,839
making and I think if you look for

1753
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,399
instance to asthma or the SRB or other

1754
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,439
Financial agencies at EU level they

1755
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:36,359
actually have the possibility to request

1756
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,979
further information to the National

1757
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,500
authorities and if these authorities are

1758
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,899
not able to offer this information they

1759
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:46,259
can directly address the financial

1760
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:48,899
parties so the the banks that they are

1761
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,219
supervising so that they can actually

1762
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,500
request further information and that

1763
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,360
kind of things also within the SRB

1764
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,460
system they the the SRB can actually

1765
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,880
follow up on how its own decision is

1766
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,219
implemented by national authorities and

1767
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:05,040
that are just details that the edpb is

1768
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,500
lacking that the gdpr did not provide to

1769
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,480
the edpb and of course it will increase

1770
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,060
the workload of the EDP and it is

1771
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,679
already struggling I think with the

1772
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:14,840
heavy

1773
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,699
workload and the short deadlines but it

1774
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:20,340
would certainly be something to look at

1775
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,679
and to find inspiration in other EU

1776
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,300
decision making bodies to make it even

1777
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,060
more efficient and to ensure that it can

1778
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,739
actually interfere with national

1779
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:33,019
decision making at all times

1780
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,239
are there any other questions

1781
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:40,739
there are other questions

1782
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:43,320
and to be balanced with the people

1783
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,140
thanks very much Owen dubsky

1784
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,000
um well I live in the Netherlands I'm

1785
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,199
from Ireland

1786
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:53,340
um uh thinking of the the meter cases

1787
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,199
um and

1788
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,159
um

1789
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,699
that wish list do you is do you what are

1790
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:01,320
the things I still don't understand is

1791
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:06,239
the uh article 21 2 has this you know we

1792
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,400
have this

1793
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,400
undeniable right to to to have our

1794
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,400
um uh personal data not be processed for

1795
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,640
direct marketing purposes but gdpr

1796
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,260
doesn't say what direct marketing

1797
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,020
purposes means

1798
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,659
um and

1799
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:27,900
uh from reading the dpc's

1800
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,380
um judgment whatever decision

1801
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,199
um they uh seem quite sort of bitter

1802
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:35,640
this is sort of a bitterness in that

1803
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,100
decision and I think the DPC is still so

1804
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,080
sort of you know was was forced to you

1805
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,640
know force their hand

1806
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,159
um will you in that wish list

1807
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,500
um will the adpp

1808
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,760
um

1809
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,960
try to get some clarity some a a unified

1810
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,960
new definition of what for direct

1811
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,000
marketing purposes means it's going to

1812
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,080
find that the wish list is already

1813
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,600
published so there is already exists

1814
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,219
what we are not waiting for is a

1815
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,440
legitive proposal most probably that

1816
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,780
might be inspired on this obviously and

1817
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,540
so the wish list is published indeed and

1818
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,340
it's some procedures and not on

1819
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,800
definitions or concepts

1820
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,320
so we will take the last question unless

1821
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,759
this question is an easy one

1822
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,239
um

1823
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,360
okay but but first person please yeah it

1824
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,580
can also go for for a closing thing it's

1825
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,100
mainly directed to the two researchers a

1826
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,140
few years ago we were thinking or some

1827
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,900
people were thinking article 65 that

1828
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,179
such a nuclear option has never gone to

1829
01:12:36,179 --> 01:12:38,460
be used because undoubtedly it will go

1830
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,440
to end up in the code of justice and

1831
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,780
then the whole system of Independence

1832
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,900
and giving instructions will unravel so

1833
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,840
what is your thought now that article 65

1834
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,360
decision is going to the code of justice

1835
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,120
on behalf of DPC and probably also in

1836
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,980
one of the court cases at noipal

1837
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,440
litigator and but I'm asking Lizette and

1838
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,900
Maria in first place not to make it too

1839
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,900
political thank you

1840
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,480
well I'm curious to see what is going to

1841
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,860
happen there because it clearly

1842
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,260
illustrates that consensus at National

1843
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,659
level is a very difficult thing and

1844
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:15,000
something that can even be brought to

1845
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,940
the highest level of review and

1846
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,100
um I I think this is also important

1847
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,800
because I think article 65 is not as

1848
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,659
strong as we thought it would be in the

1849
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:27,960
sense that the EPB cannot always decide

1850
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,520
it cannot follow up whether its

1851
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,560
decisions are implemented correctly and

1852
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,120
it also leaves actually a lot of

1853
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,400
discretion at National level and I think

1854
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,560
that is certainly a point of concern

1855
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,020
also within the system that the edpb

1856
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,719
often addresses or formulates its

1857
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,640
decisions in a rather broad way in the

1858
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,320
sense that the first decisions for

1859
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,239
instance required a higher fine but

1860
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:49,679
there was still a lot of discretion in

1861
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,260
how high that fine would be and I think

1862
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,300
the recent development that the ewb is

1863
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,060
actually giving clear ranges of fines is

1864
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,860
is a very good development but in that

1865
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:02,520
sense I think article 65 is not so

1866
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,860
so powerful as we felt from the

1867
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,260
beginning so it would be very nice to

1868
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,800
have more clarity on that from the court

1869
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,719
don't really have time for the last

1870
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,020
question it's okay because I had a last

1871
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,760
question because I'm very sensitive to

1872
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,060
people complaining so actually if you

1873
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,219
could express not a wish list but one

1874
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:25,199
wish and here's the journey that I'm

1875
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,580
going to solve the enforcement of the

1876
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,580
gdpr you have each one wish for this

1877
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,800
future instrument that perhaps will see

1878
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,900
the light at some point between for next

1879
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,760
year what would be the one with the

1880
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,620
thing that you really want this future

1881
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,540
instrument to tackle and to solve

1882
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:43,699
people's cells from Maria

1883
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,600
to your question and I'm also very

1884
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,239
curious about the outcome and I'm also

1885
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:52,739
happy that it happened actually because

1886
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,719
it just shows that we are learning how

1887
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,640
to enforce the gdpr and it was just all

1888
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,500
expected it's a natural process and it's

1889
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,659
just exciting to see how it evolves and

1890
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,659
just to track it and how we also

1891
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:05,640
formulate like we are in the process

1892
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,920
forming the EU administrative procedural

1893
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,840
loan that's a fact not the given on this

1894
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,260
very uh empirical level so it's just

1895
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,520
very interesting to me to observe this

1896
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,760
and when it comes to my wish oh God it's

1897
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,580
very

1898
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,620
uh I just wish it was a regulatory level

1899
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,199
I think that's like it should be a

1900
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:27,780
regulation that should be clear

1901
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,060
um and that's as easy as as clear as

1902
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,800
possible

1903
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,980
uh I'll be very quick article 65 is a

1904
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:37,020
decision making process so it's a way to

1905
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,640
solve this agreement and it's normal

1906
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,400
that we're using it from time to time uh

1907
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,020
for the wish list I will take an easy

1908
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,280
way out I will say Implement all of it

1909
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,860
so which is I think if DBA was were

1910
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,080
working as fast and efficiently as ddpb

1911
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,120
is working to reach a final decision and

1912
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,860
it's a compliment I think I would be

1913
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,960
happy because when you see the DPC is

1914
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,420
taking four years and a half to find a

1915
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,580
preliminary draft Drive decision and

1916
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,800
have you seen the ADP decision 200 pages

1917
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,620
to meet three three days to read it

1918
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:10,080
and I would be happy that yeah DPA would

1919
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,400
just reach a decision as quick as the

1920
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,159
ebb can do

1921
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:17,159
oh sorry

1922
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:19,739
um my biggest wish would be

1923
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:21,840
implementation of the principle of good

1924
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,659
governance I think in the sense that the

1925
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:28,260
charter article 41 is not applicable to

1926
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,300
National Administration so it has to

1927
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,520
come from the Court's case law and

1928
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,500
that's very difficult to understand as a

1929
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,780
complainant especially I think I'm sorry

1930
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,580
it would be great to have that in one

1931
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,739
harmonized documents applicable to all

1932
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,280
dpas

1933
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:45,540
still the microphone I think we are

1934
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,300
doing good in terms of time so I just

1935
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,940
have to thank you all actually there is

1936
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,739
time for the surprise last question of

1937
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:53,580
what

1938
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:56,640
well it's a bit of a downer

1939
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,980
um if you've readily proposed European

1940
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,140
health data space regulation

1941
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,300
you will notice that it claims not to

1942
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,520
derogate whatsoever from the gdpr but it

1943
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,560
claims creates a new regulatory space

1944
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,080
for the Health Data exchanges which is

1945
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,480
effectively put outside the purview of

1946
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,060
the dpas with a mechanism that is more

1947
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,360
vague than the one of the gdpr so it's

1948
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,940
kind of a Call of it to action it to at

1949
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,820
least a DPA is to start thinking about a

1950
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,679
near future world in which you will have

1951
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,920
Health Data exchanges that are more or

1952
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,080
less outside their normal dispute

1953
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,480
resolution mechanism

1954
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,780
Maria was thinking about the other

1955
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,120
instruments

1956
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,380
so no so uh I as I was mentioning there

1957
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,940
will be even more regulations and even

1958
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,520
though there are already clashes between

1959
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,500
this already standing allows of gdpr and

1960
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,780
competition law

1961
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,540
and I think we can just meet here in the

1962
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,100
five years from now and we will be

1963
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,900
discussing the need to introducing some

1964
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,360
kind of a framework to how the all the

1965
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,540
how to cover all this data uh related

1966
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,400
regulations on how to how they should

1967
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,900
interact with each other and what with

1968
