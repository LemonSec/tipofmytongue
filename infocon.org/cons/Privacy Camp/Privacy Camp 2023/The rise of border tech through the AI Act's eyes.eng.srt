1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,700
um good morning everyone

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,319
um welcome to this one of the first

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,960
sessions of privacy Camp I think we are

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,179
all kind of excited to kick off this

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,820
morning so bear with us if we are a bit

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,900
nervous

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,219
um as we start

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,440
so as the name of the organic of this

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,180
session stays uh we are going to talk

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,520
about the rise and Rise of Border

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,180
technology in European legislation and

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,519
the intersection between digital files

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,560
and migration files so what we will do

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,780
today will be to reflect on how digital

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,219
files are legalized digital files are

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,399
legalizing in a way the digitalization

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,020
of migration procedures but also

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,719
normalizing uh some practices

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,020
um that I've been proven to be

20
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,340
violent and highly discriminatory

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,680
against people without the regular

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,379
migration status people are applying for

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,260
Asylum refugees and more General people

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,719
Crossing Borders

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,700
um so we will also reflect on the role

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,920
of digital policy in reinforcing the

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,460
security narrative that it's um

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,840
spreading around borders and migration

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,420
in general and

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,240
um also this idea that non-european

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,580
citizens represent a threat to European

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,140
countries and that therefore should be

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,420
pushed back and pushed outside of the

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,920
European borders with any means

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,580
including digital ones so as the title

36
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,520
of this panel suggests we will kick off

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,860
this discussion Through The Eyes of the

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
artificial intelligence act which is

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,540
um regulation proposed by the European

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,159
commission April 2021

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,320
and the objective of this regulation is

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,960
to promote the uptake of Transport AI

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,399
while at the same time protective

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,860
fundamental rights but in our work at

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,840
Civic Society we have been asking

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,579
ourselves one fundamental question which

47
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,220
is was rights are we talking about in

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,320
fact

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,140
despite the evidence of the deployment

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,199
of many AI artificial intelligence based

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,959
systems immigrations such as the

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,420
automation of migration procedures the

53
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,060
use of biometric identification tools or

54
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,879
surveillance Technologies like drones to

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
scan the borders the proposed regulation

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,860
is failing to capture all of these

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,300
different type of Technologies and to

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,040
regulate them despite Civic Society

59
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,500
um recommendations and evidence of the

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,800
use and abuse of artificial intelligence

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,020
so without further Ado

62
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,239
um I will start by presenting this

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,319
amazing panel and speakers

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,920
um and Friends also so I'll start with

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,900
the Civil Society Corner

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,379
um on my left we have Alina Smith who's

67
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,420
deputy director of picom the platform of

68
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,040
international cooperation on documented

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
migrant which is a breast based

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
membership organization representing

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,260
more than 160 organizations advocating

72
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,420
for the rights of people without a

73
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,080
regular migration status

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,700
and Alina is also the focal point for

75
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
the digital files at picom then we have

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,000
hope Barker a senior policy Analyst at

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,040
the border violence monitoring Network

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,099
which is an horizontal

79
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,220
Collective working on mainly on the

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,060
region of the western Balkans and is

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,959
monitoring

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,599
as you can see and hope will explain a

83
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,060
bit more about this later is monitoring

84
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,819
the practice of pushbacks

85
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,640
um in in the region and the is

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,459
collecting evidence about

87
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,140
the violence against people crossing

88
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,440
border and is the as a collective now

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,540
they are starting to monitor more and

90
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,519
more the role of surveillance technology

91
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,840
in in facilitating pushbacks then on my

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,159
right we have Professor near vivavola

93
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,080
senior lecturer and associate professor

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,720
at Queen Mary university neovi is one of

95
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,580
the greatest experts when it comes to

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,140
the digitalization of migration

97
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,299
procedures she has been started

98
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,940
analyzing the expansion of migration

99
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,160
databases when nobody was actually

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,919
looking at them and also

101
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,500
um yeah

102
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,419
seeing how denouncing the fundamental

103
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,639
rights implication that comes with the

104
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,220
expansion of these databases and then

105
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,080
last but not least for sure we have

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,199
simonade here which is digital advisor

107
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,860
for the green links since 2020

108
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,380
Simona advises members of the European

109
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,240
parliaments in the greens group

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
especially she's advisor to the MEP

111
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,759
Technica Street and Kim van Sparta who's

112
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,800
one of the Shadows of the a act and she

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,139
works on different files the ACT but

114
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,199
also platform regulation and also the

115
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,220
use of technology in migration procedure

116
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,259
so I can say that we have some good

117
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,740
experts today to talk about the rise and

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,840
Rise of

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,660
border attack in EU legislations but we

120
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,840
will start through the AI act ice so I

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,320
will turn to Simona since you uh work

122
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,060
with policy makers and you are involved

123
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,060
in the policy making process I think not

124
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,919
everyone in the audience is aware of

125
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,020
like where we are with the AI act no

126
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,080
maybe many of us are following this

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,360
crazy regulation but not everyone so if

128
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,759
you could give us a little update of

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,699
where we are at and especially where we

130
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,440
are at in this regulation with the uses

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,080
of AI in the migration and Water

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,039
Management thank you do you have a

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,060
just put my mind

134
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,759
does this work yes

135
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,500
okay well thank you very much Catalina

136
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,080
and um maybe to zoom out a little bit

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,460
when we're speaking about the role of

138
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,199
civil society today you already

139
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,600
mentioned I work on various files and

140
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,820
technology in migration and at the

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,000
border is seriously the most obscure and

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,300
untransparent area I work on which makes

143
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,440
us completely reliant on civil society

144
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,539
academics investigative journalists to

145
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,940
delve into these topics so I'd like to

146
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,740
start with a big thank you already in

147
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,720
advance for helping us doing all the

148
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,240
work we do on this

149
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,660
and um yes well if we zoom out

150
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,419
um broader policy wise we see that

151
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,240
technology is used to facilitate and

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,500
justify

153
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,960
um keeping people out and pushing people

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,000
back at the moment

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,539
um when people do enter the territory

156
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,840
profiling analyzing them and

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,880
tracking them constantly and even in

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,160
reception areas we see surveillance

159
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,500
systems that are really unprecedented

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,319
are deployed so

161
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,660
um well I find it really horrific to see

162
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,120
sometimes what um reports there are from

163
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
the ground on what is happening and I

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
think it's very important to say that

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,740
the paradoxes that while on the one hand

166
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,120
you can see the commission is

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,960
championing these Technologies and uh

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
member states too

169
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,319
we at the same time see that there is

170
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,319
secretive as possible about it so this

171
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,740
is also where it touches upon the AI act

172
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,940
I've been told to keep it very simple

173
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,220
and not to go off in an AI act rant so

174
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,840
stop me if I do

175
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,020
for those who haven't been introduced to

176
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,860
this law yet the AI Act is the Europe's

177
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,280
attempt to regulate AI you might think

178
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,060
wow that's pretty broad it is and it's

179
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,039
taking us a long time

180
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,800
but um the basic concept is

181
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,599
you basically look whether a system is

182
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,639
high risk and poses a high risk to

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,680
fundamental rights and if it's up to the

184
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,960
European Parliament also to democracy

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,340
the rule of law

186
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,419
uh or health and safety and if it can be

187
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,300
used for a certain use that has been

188
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,160
shown to pose a risk to fundamental

189
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,919
rights for example then you need to meet

190
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
a whole list of technical requirements

191
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,699
so make sure your system is not biased

192
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,220
make sure it's robust make sure it's

193
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,080
cyber secure Etc

194
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
and um

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,379
there are also some transparency

196
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,319
obligations that we're working on and

197
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
there is also a very important article

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,000
with banned uses of artificial

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,740
intelligence

200
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,820
now I think most important is in the

201
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,620
work of Civil Society here is that

202
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,620
you've been pushing for uh bans on

203
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
certain uses for example risk profiling

204
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,880
um we've seen risk profiling go wrong in

205
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,399
many areas one of the ones that some of

206
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,140
you will have heard me talk about a lot

207
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,240
is the Dutch Child Benefits Affair where

208
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,080
the government risk profiled lots and

209
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,180
lots of people in plummeted more than 70

210
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,600
000 people into debt even losing their

211
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,459
children

212
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,920
um just because they had a relatively

213
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,980
simple risk profiling system telling who

214
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,140
was a fraud

215
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,660
um in child benefits and who was not

216
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,720
and we're seeing these exact same

217
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,540
systems being deployed in the area of

218
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,120
migration we see as Novi will probably

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,580
say tell us a lot more about huge

220
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,800
databases being set up and linked

221
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,100
together which another point in the AI

222
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,160
act were Exempted completely from the AI

223
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,680
act because yeah all these very big

224
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,600
databases why would they have to meet

225
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,240
basic requirements

226
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,180
um and I think the points on migration

227
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,220
are going to be huge fights also with

228
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,720
the member states because the member

229
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,660
states have already finished their

230
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,500
um

231
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,080
position and what we see they've done is

232
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,580
they've Exempted

233
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,860
migration from all the transparency

234
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,560
obligations from different areas because

235
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,420
that's what they like to do they like to

236
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,160
use it as a solution for everything but

237
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,440
then be very secretive about it so there

238
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
can't be any public scrutiny and that's

239
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,720
an easy getaway for them

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,480
so these are uh very important points

241
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,100
we're negotiating about at the moment

242
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,380
the European Parliament is still

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,080
negotiating among themselves before we

244
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,120
go and negotiate with the member states

245
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,920
and

246
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,779
um we're still to discuss the bands in a

247
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,339
couple of weeks but we've definitely

248
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,620
tabled a couple of bands on risk

249
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,140
profiling and migration

250
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,440
um for example lie detectors and emotion

251
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,820
recognition and migration that we've

252
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,600
seen have been tested and used on

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,340
um well refugees

254
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,720
[Music]

255
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
um

256
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,920
and these are things we've tabled and at

257
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,420
the same time we see that the European

258
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,040
commission has designated some uses of

259
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,200
AIA migration as high risk

260
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,959
but that also means you legitimize them

261
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,300
for example they've said well okay then

262
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,860
we'll make polygraphs and emotion

263
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,519
recognition used in migration high risk

264
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,620
and then you'll have to meet a certain

265
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,980
amount of requirements when you use them

266
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,140
but this means that actually they're

267
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,820
saying well if you meet a number of

268
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,220
requirements then it's okay to use these

269
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,920
systems in migration and I think these

270
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,140
are developments that will as we'll

271
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,180
discuss later we see in lots of

272
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,820
legislation that they're in law

273
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,279
legitimizing the use of these horrific

274
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,519
and dehumanizing systems especially in

275
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,100
the area of migration and these are

276
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,959
developments we need to stop as soon as

277
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,060
possible according to us

278
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,600
thanks thank you um everyone thanks Sima

279
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,399
you did a great job in trying to

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,300
summarize in five minutes this history

281
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,160
of the Air Act which is really

282
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,200
complicated for those of you who have

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,700
been following from the beginning it's

284
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,980
kind of a soap opera up and downs and

285
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,920
and I think the um as you were

286
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,500
mentioning the migration demands show

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,019
how construct Victory can this

288
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,820
regulation can be

289
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,040
um because it applies certain safeguards

290
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,320
to some systems but some some others it

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
actually fails to do so so you mentioned

292
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,240
that one of the most crucial articles

293
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,399
and part of this regulation is concerns

294
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,740
prohibitions therefore this is a kind of

295
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,480
like a courageous step of this

296
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,060
regulation to say there are some systems

297
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,540
that will inevitably harm fundamental

298
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,220
rights there are no mitigation measures

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,079
that you can apply therefore they should

300
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,680
be banned however we don't see any kind

301
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,839
of a band that applies to the context of

302
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,940
migration despite the amounting evidence

303
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,760
sense of the variable harms that certain

304
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,700
systems can can lead to so now I would

305
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,120
like to ask neovie if you could guide us

306
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,459
through one of Civil Society

307
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,079
recommendations that as seen one I was

308
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
saying is about prohibited prohibiting

309
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,660
risk assessment automated risk

310
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,760
assessment and profiling systems used in

311
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,980
the migration procedures so could you

312
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,459
explain us what these systems are and

313
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,680
why they should be prohibited

314
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,779
thanks

315
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:17,399
first of all thank you so much Katarina

316
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,760
for the kind invitation and introduction

317
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,800
and it is also a great pleasure to see

318
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,079
so many people interested in technology

319
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,120
and migration when I started my work 10

320
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,339
years ago there were hardly any people

321
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,500
interested or understanding what we were

322
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,720
doing and it was considered too

323
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,760
technical so now it's become quite

324
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,860
mainstream and quite important so it's

325
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,560
so nice to to to see people interested

326
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
in this field

327
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,240
um I I want to start my contribution by

328
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,480
making two vital points which relate

329
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,820
particularly with the use of technology

330
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,380
in migration context and we need to have

331
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,000
in mind when we're looking into

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,639
immigration law in particular how

333
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,660
immigration rules are inherently

334
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,339
discriminating groups of individuals

335
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,060
compared to Citizens they create a

336
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,760
divide between citizens and foreigners

337
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,399
by default on the basis of The Sovereign

338
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,339
right of every state to decide with whom

339
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,639
they wish to associate and this also

340
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,700
creates another a huge imbalance of

341
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
power between foreigners and the state

342
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,880
and that imbalance is also perpetuated

343
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,120
by the fact that individuals are outside

344
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,019
the Border having more limited access to

345
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:42,060
remedies to lawyers to Legal Aid so with

346
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,040
this

347
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,660
preliminary thoughts in mind we should

348
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,760
approach the a act and its migration

349
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,360
related Provisions so if one has a look

350
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,639
at the AI act they will realize that

351
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,160
there are only very limited prohibited

352
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,279
AI systems those related to social

353
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,800
scoring and remote biometric

354
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,339
identification for

355
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:06,800
criminal law purposes

356
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,500
everything else is fair game and

357
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,600
especially in relation to migration

358
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,779
there is nothing prohibited

359
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,699
notwithstanding many different uses of

360
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,339
AI and they are inherently

361
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,639
discriminatory effects I want to speak

362
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,980
about four of this and guide you through

363
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,980
as to why civil society and legal

364
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,920
scholarship has explained why they

365
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,019
should be prohibited at least for some

366
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,740
years if not forever the first one and I

367
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,899
think that's the the for me the biggest

368
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,480
take is is emotional recognition and

369
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,560
behavior analytics emotional recognition

370
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,899
looks basically is technology that takes

371
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,959
into account the facial expressions of a

372
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,880
new individual the way that they speak

373
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,000
through lie detectors and other types of

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,660
polygraphs and they can be used in order

375
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,800
to enable a Border guard or a person

376
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,560
determining an asylum claim whether that

377
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,420
person tells the truth about their story

378
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,820
so they it can help can help it can

379
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,880
assist or it can doom and Asylum Seeker

380
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,839
when they make a claim and it can be

381
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,660
used for The credibility assessment or

382
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,860
and this technology should be banned for

383
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,160
the very important reason that the

384
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,139
scientists show that it is not reliable

385
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,500
it cannot capture it may capture some

386
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,860
basic moods of individuals but it cannot

387
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,500
capture Blended moods it cannot capture

388
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,740
different different cultural

389
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,720
backgrounds and for that emotional

390
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,980
recognition is vital to be prohibited at

391
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,920
least until a lot of data trained in

392
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,259
order to make it reliable which cannot

393
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:56,240
happen

394
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,680
even people from you know the same

395
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,259
country of origin the same region they

396
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,000
may have you know different backgrounds

397
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,919
they may have very different expressions

398
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,679
and because of the impact that it can

399
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,939
have in an asylum seeker's claim

400
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,919
it it is very vital to make it

401
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,919
prohibited at least for many years

402
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,799
the second is Predictive Analytics

403
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,500
Predator analytics is basically

404
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,380
artificial intelligence technology that

405
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,480
takes into account social media reports

406
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
satellites Radars different types of

407
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,040
information in order to predict

408
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,660
migration flows it is already tested in

409
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,080
different EU projects not with too much

410
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,299
success I have to say and the problem

411
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,059
with this technology is that it is a

412
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,059
double-edged sword it can be used either

413
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,539
to welcome to prepare a country to

414
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,640
receive Asylum Seekers and other kinds

415
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,520
of migrants or it can be used to

416
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,640
interdict and be used for unlawful

417
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,760
pushbacks and the problem is that we

418
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,220
don't really know what is going to

419
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,039
happen and for that reason Predictive

420
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,320
Analytics which miraculously doesn't

421
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,960
even feature in the AI act as an

422
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,299
artificial intelligence system should be

423
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,000
banned because it can be abused by

424
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,740
States

425
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,460
the third one and the here we enter the

426
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,919
arena of AI systems that are already

427
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,860
being created at EU level so it makes

428
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,380
all the more difficult to ask for their

429
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,299
prohibition because they are legitimized

430
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,580
by the EU legislature in other files are

431
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,140
automated risk assessments profile

432
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,360
profiling so we are talking about

433
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,360
systems that essentially are trained to

434
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,520
find on the basis of huge amounts of

435
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,179
Statistics patterns or correlations in

436
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,340
order to identify for future

437
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,559
applications for visas of residence

438
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,500
permits or vaselum Seekers as to whether

439
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,020
they pose a risk it may be a security

440
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,240
risk it may be an irregular migration

441
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,179
risk but they are making automated risk

442
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,000
assessment on the basis if not of

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,580
protected characteristics at least of

444
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,919
proxies of protected characteristics so

445
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,679
instead of using racial origin as an

446
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,280
indicator they may use the address which

447
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,220
they saw racial origin so this is a

448
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,440
proxy

449
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,960
so they are trained on the basis of data

450
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,559
which are provided by States and those

451
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,720
data are based on previous previous

452
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,240
decisions previous decisions in

453
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,100
migration contexts can be very much

454
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,500
discriminatory themselves border guards

455
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,559
or you know of these authorities are

456
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,799
maybe discriminating because they are

457
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,900
not well trained they or they have

458
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,360
inherent discrete biases and those

459
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,940
biases translate in algorithms which

460
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,299
means that here we institutionalize

461
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,380
discriminatory treatment even if it's

462
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,960
not direct indirect discriminatory

463
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,000
treatment of different groups of

464
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,700
migrants why this is a problem and why

465
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,160
this technology should be prohibited not

466
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,440
only because because this discriminatory

467
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,740
treatment in its indirect and indirect

468
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,860
discrimination at the moment is not well

469
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,100
protected there is not much guarantees

470
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,679
in the case law at the European at least

471
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,380
level which protects not only migrants

472
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,660
anyone from indirect discrimination so

473
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,280
unless we reconceive what is protected

474
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,900
what is the concept the meaning and the

475
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,580
scope of discriminate the principle of

476
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,679
non-discrimination these Technologies

477
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,660
should be prohibited

478
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,760
the final one and I know I'm speaking

479
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,140
quite a lot

480
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,260
um is remote biometric identification so

481
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,240
at the moment it's only prohibited for

482
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,299
criminal law operations in criminal law

483
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,960
context but again member states want to

484
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,020
downgrade that uh and there is nothing

485
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,140
on migration which means that it it's

486
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,360
quite dystopian to think about it is

487
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,880
that they are going to be using cameras

488
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,059
that are going to be seeing the faces of

489
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,820
people coming at the border again and

490
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,980
they can be abused in order to prevent

491
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,559
people from syncing entry and we're

492
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,840
talking about not only migrants but also

493
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,960
refuges so this can be a form of digital

494
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,860
reformation and in this remote biometric

495
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,900
identification it involves obviously

496
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,760
facial recognition so this kind of

497
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
Technologies again are not fully

498
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,600
reliable it is a bit more reliable than

499
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,179
emotional recognition but still it's not

500
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,059
reliable as much I think I'm gonna stop

501
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,240
my contribution here this is Food For

502
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
Thought for future discussions and I

503
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,620
look forward to those yeah thank you

504
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,159
it's a full blanket of food of thought

505
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,020
um you did a great job thank you very

506
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,980
much in giving us an overview on the old

507
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,880
Civic Society recommendation and

508
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
prohibition but also starting from the

509
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,640
very uh important point which is

510
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,919
um when it comes to migration policies

511
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,720
procedures there is an imbalance of

512
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,419
power that is inherent into the policy

513
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,000
itself that must be questioned in the

514
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,539
moment that we analyze or Advocate or

515
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,200
influence the policy because as you have

516
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,419
um have explained

517
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,280
um this kind this imbalance can be then

518
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,380
reproduced and reinforced in these

519
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,020
systems that should be banned

520
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,700
turning

521
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,400
um to Alina

522
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,260
another category is Simona was

523
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,539
explaining of AI systems that are

524
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,720
regulated in the AI Act is the high risk

525
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,659
type of systems therefore risk systems

526
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,600
that might lead to the infringement of

527
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,780
fundamental rights that in principle are

528
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,760
not bad but they could

529
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,679
um they could lead to very negative

530
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,400
effects on on people's rights

531
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,980
in the original proposal we have the

532
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,460
commission proposed some ai

533
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,380
ai systems using migration that should

534
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,039
be considered as high risk however we

535
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,020
see that there are like some very Mis

536
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,240
important missing points in the way that

537
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,100
the commission

538
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,039
look captured all the air systems that

539
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,860
are already deployed in migration and

540
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,000
one of the system which is missing is

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,760
biometric identification tools

542
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,520
so could you please tell us what these

543
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,700
systems are and why I made they are

544
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,100
dangers where they are used and what is

545
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,600
their impact on the rights of

546
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,439
undocumented people

547
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,320
thank you very much Katarina uh really

548
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,080
nice to be with you all this morning and

549
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,940
just echoing yovi's Point great to see

550
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,659
the interest in these issues

551
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,179
um so I mean as a starting point I think

552
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,100
we all know ID checks are essential

553
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,220
feature of migration policy they happen

554
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,100
routinely at Borders in airports we've

555
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,799
all experienced them and on the streets

556
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,780
of our neighborhoods

557
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,880
um and they're part of a strategy

558
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,419
essentially to try to address

559
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,100
um

560
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,659
concerns

561
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:16,620
disproportionate concerns arguably about

562
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,480
the use of false documents and also to

563
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,280
achieve the European Union's goals

564
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
around increasing the number of

565
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,919
deportations

566
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,740
and artificial intelligence tools are

567
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,600
widely used to facilitate identity

568
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
checks

569
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,380
including through the use of mobile

570
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,900
biometric identification devices that

571
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,580
make it possible for instance to scram

572
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,580
to scan somebody's fingerprints or their

573
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,820
face in the street

574
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,780
instantaneously have information about

575
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,120
them because that data is crosstract

576
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,220
against other databases

577
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,640
so why does this matter why is this

578
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,900
concerning

579
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,000
um so maybe it's just helpful you know

580
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,320
as we've already done a little bit to

581
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,840
just step back and really contemplate a

582
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,299
bit the context where

583
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,280
we're speaking of

584
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,440
um so you know we can think as we should

585
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,240
that immigration law really concerns

586
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,760
administrative matters right it concerns

587
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,580
who qualifies for visas and permits to

588
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,440
enter a country to remain in a country

589
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,620
to work to study all of this concerns

590
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,059
administrative law

591
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,900
except that in reality a significant

592
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,720
portion of how immigration law functions

593
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,419
borrows from the tools and even the

594
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:33,720
logic of criminal law and also from the

595
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,220
very institutions of criminal law like

596
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,220
law enforcement and so this comes of

597
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,440
course without the corresponding rights

598
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,820
and safeguards that we find in the

599
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,520
criminal justice system

600
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,980
and we know and there is obviously very

601
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,500
strong evidence of the fact that racial

602
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,419
profiling is embedded in law enforcement

603
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,520
practice it's also embedded in

604
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
Immigration enforcement practice

605
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,700
um and indeed the fact that how a person

606
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,419
looks including their skin color their

607
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,279
perceived ethnicity

608
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,059
um

609
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,140
are used as proxies for whether they

610
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,000
have authorization to be on the

611
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,100
territory and so I think it's important

612
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,260
to underscore this has implications for

613
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,679
lots of people so the notion of who is

614
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,039
deportable or who is potentially subject

615
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,740
to immigration control affects anyone

616
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,380
who is viewed as potentially within

617
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,580
those categories based on their

618
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,940
appearance and indeed

619
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,000
a survey from 2014 from the EU Agency

620
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
for fundamental rights found that 80

621
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,679
close to 80 percent of Border guards

622
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,100
surveyed found that in Airport's

623
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,960
ethnicity was a quote-unquote helpful

624
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,419
indicator of identifying people

625
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:51,480
attempting to enter irregularly

626
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,299
um and the Dutch Border Police

627
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:55,799
were supported in their use of racial

628
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,600
profiling in our ports by The Hague

629
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,320
district court in 2021 which agreed that

630
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,240
indeed ethnicity can be a quote

631
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,720
important indication of nationality they

632
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,940
then did away with this practice because

633
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,220
of the public outcry about obviously

634
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,520
pursuing this practice

635
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,740
and so what is actually occurring in

636
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,840
reality

637
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,240
so statewatch produced a report I think

638
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
it was last year

639
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,620
on building the biometric state which

640
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,900
gives us a picture and a flavor of how

641
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,600
already a number of member states have

642
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,100
empowered law enforcement to do

643
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,799
immigration control using handheld

644
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,440
biometric identification tools including

645
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,960
France Germany the Netherlands Spain

646
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,200
Denmark and Sweden among others

647
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,440
um we know that since 2019 there's the

648
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,860
smart policing program in Greece which

649
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,500
equips police with such devices to allow

650
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,059
them to scan vehicle license plates

651
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,760
collect fingerprints scan faces for the

652
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,299
purposes of immigration control

653
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:05,940
and some work done by ngos in the UK

654
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,960
found that the use of mobile handheld

655
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,580
data for ID tracks for migration control

656
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,460
between 2019 and 2020 resulted in

657
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,460
systematic racial bias so I think this

658
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,960
is a really important part of the

659
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,940
context that we're speaking of and the

660
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,760
concern that the use of these tools is

661
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,880
very likely to exacerbate and to worsen

662
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,940
existing practices and I think it's also

663
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,159
important to underscore that these tools

664
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,559
go hand the existence and use of these

665
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,559
tools those hand in glove with the drive

666
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,539
to collect data about the people we're

667
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,940
speaking about because these tools are

668
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,520
used to cross-check against various

669
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,159
types of databases where personal

670
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,620
biometric data are already existing or

671
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,140
are being further gathered so again it

672
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,600
kind of is a self-fulfilling or Vicious

673
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,419
Circle where we have the amassed data

674
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,220
therefore we use it to do this type of

675
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,080
processing well to do this type of

676
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,760
processing we need to have this amounts

677
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,880
data to be able to cross-check and do

678
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,059
the processing the way we we wish to so

679
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,580
I think maybe just to briefly say

680
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,980
something about I think Simona already

681
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,919
alluded to these vast migration I.T

682
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,600
systems that come under the the

683
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,279
framework of the eu's interoperability

684
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,440
system

685
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,539
um so we're speaking about colossal

686
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,480
levels of data collection oriented and

687
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,179
targeted toward whom toward non-eu

688
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:33,059
citizens with a capacity of up to 300

689
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,480
million records to address

690
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,279
serious crimes like terrorism and

691
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,740
irregular migration as if these two

692
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
things were co-extensive so already we

693
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,559
see the baked in discrimination and

694
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,779
false assumptions justifying the

695
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,120
creation of these systems and why were

696
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,919
these systems created more practically

697
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,520
was to support and part increased ID

698
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,039
checks to identify people on the

699
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,020
territory and potentially entering the

700
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,360
territory who could become undocumented

701
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,240
or irregular and deploy affordable

702
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,539
and how to achieve that but to equip

703
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,000
those on the ground at Borders and

704
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,620
within our neighborhoods with the

705
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,140
devices to allow them to do that on the

706
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,980
spot

707
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,779
and so I think it's important again to

708
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,000
realize what the implications are the

709
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,820
consequences are for all different kinds

710
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,820
of people entering Europe but already in

711
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,740
Europe including people who are

712
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,840
Nationals who are citizens but who may

713
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,240
be perceived as being foreigners and

714
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,860
what it means in terms of the likelihood

715
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,020
of their interaction with law

716
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,240
enforcement and the potential outcomes

717
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,480
for them as individuals and maybe just a

718
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,000
final point that again when we think

719
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,399
about I think it's really important to

720
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,159
underscore and we're hearing about and

721
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,360
we'll hear a little bit more about later

722
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,039
EU

723
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,000
um

724
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
and to an extent also National level

725
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,399
legislation that normalizes and

726
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,200
facilitates the use of technology in

727
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,899
these ways but let's be clear that the

728
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,460
existing protections under the charter

729
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,559
and the gdpr apply to everyone

730
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,600
regardless of their citizenship or

731
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
immigration status and what we see is

732
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,760
the use of a cert the criminal justice

733
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,419
mindset and a securitization objective

734
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,720
without sufficient justification to make

735
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,299
the case or not to make the case and

736
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,080
just circumvent those protections so to

737
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,260
just go around them because we're to

738
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,440
take for granted that this is about

739
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
criminal law this is about safety and

740
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,000
not to query whether that really really

741
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,799
is the case

742
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,059
so

743
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,919
um I think I'll leave it at that for now

744
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,980
but I think the context really matters

745
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,720
here in terms of understanding how these

746
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,440
tools can worsen an existing reality and

747
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,039
the particular impact it can have on the

748
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,360
experience of individuals and their

749
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,159
outcomes

750
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,120
thank you Elena um you did a great job

751
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,340
in setting the scenes explaining what

752
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,200
these systems are

753
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
um what is the relationship with

754
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,299
deportation which is clearly one of the

755
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,880
main objectives

756
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,340
of the European commission and and

757
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,919
agencies when it comes to migration

758
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,700
policies and it's quite striking um as

759
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,500
you if you compare like what Alina just

760
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,380
talked about and the fact that

761
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,840
policymakers negotiating the Air Act

762
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,200
um are really reluctant to the idea of

763
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,600
um regulating biometric identification

764
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,799
systems in the AI act and are attempting

765
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,320
to exclude EU migration databases which

766
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,779
are the source for help making this kind

767
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:49,799
of tools um working and the other

768
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,260
um concerning missing piece and the

769
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,659
regulation is all those type of

770
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:57,260
surveillance Technologies which are

771
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,960
deployed at the borders and within the

772
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,240
EU borders which have the objective to

773
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,240
basically prevent entries

774
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,620
and and push people back as these black

775
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,500
pile of papers can testimony so hope

776
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,500
could you please tell us first a little

777
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,240
bit about the work of Border violence

778
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,960
monitoring Network and how you have been

779
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,299
observing the rise of surveillance

780
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,039
technology

781
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:32,640
um

782
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
within borders in the western Balkans

783
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,299
and what effects they have on people

784
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,519
that are trying to cross borders

785
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,340
yeah thank you Katarina

786
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,200
um yeah so I will again come back to

787
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,299
Bringing how these policies are playing

788
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,620
out on the ground

789
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,299
um and how they're affecting people on

790
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,159
the Move currently

791
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,960
um so to do that I have to explain a bit

792
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,539
about who we are and how we work

793
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,100
um so the board of violence monitoring

794
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,380
network is a horizontal self-organized

795
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,419
Network that's denouncing pushbacks and

796
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,760
other human rights violations against

797
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,039
people on the move at and within

798
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,740
European borders so we're 14 member

799
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,379
organizations active since 2017

800
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,139
stretching from Greece all the way up to

801
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,000
Austria and turkey covering the whole

802
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Western Balkan route

803
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,320
and basically what we our field

804
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,839
volunteers do is they contribute to a

805
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,119
shared online database which brings

806
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,440
together first-hand accounts of

807
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,739
pushbacks which are illegal board across

808
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,379
illegal cross-border expulsions without

809
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,899
due process individualized assessment or

810
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,520
any opportunity for appealing those

811
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,500
decisions made so they're completely

812
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,839
occurring outside of new legislation and

813
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,520
are illegal

814
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,199
um so the testimonies that are gathered

815
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,418
by reporters in the field

816
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,580
um these are done using a standardized

817
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,099
reporting methodology and those

818
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,440
testimonies then come together in our

819
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
biggest publication that we do which is

820
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,560
the Black Book of pushbacks which is

821
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,480
here which people can take a look at

822
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,260
when they want to later but basically we

823
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,359
bring together all of the evidence all

824
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,220
of the testimonies that we have with an

825
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,020
accompanying analysis of Trends and

826
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,480
patterns in different countries but also

827
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,339
new emerging developments and this is

828
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,020
the new version of the book which is

829
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,380
over 3000 pages and that's all of the

830
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,560
testimonies we've collected since 2017

831
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,240
and in this version of the book which we

832
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,640
didn't have in the 2021 we have a new

833
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,700
chapter on the use of new technology and

834
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,980
artificial intelligence so this is

835
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,540
something that we've seen

836
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,780
um as a new rapidly expanding area of

837
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,820
migration management and we've seen

838
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,460
Artificial Intelligence being advertised

839
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,380
as a sort of technical Panacea for the

840
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,599
ongoing consequences of failed migration

841
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,480
policies since the 2015 crisis the

842
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,660
so-called 2015 crisis

843
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,480
and the the real world implications of

844
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,099
these new tools have been widely

845
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:56,280
documented for years including as many

846
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,780
people here have spoken about the

847
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,660
inherent bias and racism of algorithmic

848
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,400
machine learning and the problematic

849
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,619
consequences of risk-based or predictive

850
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:06,260
policing

851
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,060
but it is important to point out that

852
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,460
artificial intelligence is not in and of

853
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,220
itself the problem here because some of

854
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,780
these new technologies might have

855
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,780
positive impacts like using drones to

856
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,700
identify people on the Move in

857
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,920
situations of risk and to organize

858
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,260
search and rescue operations just like

859
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,060
the Sea Watch drone does along the

860
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,280
central Mediterranean route so the

861
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,440
problem is not with the technology but

862
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,079
with how it's being used and our data

863
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,540
shows that how it's being used is to

864
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,339
contribute to the facilitation of

865
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,339
push-back practices and to enhance the

866
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,079
ease with which they can be carried out

867
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,380
so we see devices like drones thermal

868
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,680
imaging Canada cameras vehicle scanners

869
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,560
being weaponized against people on the

870
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,380
Move making them easier to detect and

871
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,460
therefore compounding their

872
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,619
vulnerability and the dangers that they

873
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,140
face but on top of this there's a

874
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,079
concurrent trend of suppression and

875
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,119
destruction of the technology owned by

876
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,060
people on the Move by state forces so

877
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,920
when Transit groups are apprehended

878
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,900
they're normally stripped of their

879
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,240
belongings including their cell phones

880
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,339
and power Banks and these are things

881
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:18,960
that can be used not only to navigate

882
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,300
the route but to document the human

883
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,859
rights violations that are being

884
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,740
perpetrated against them so the theft

885
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,920
and destruction of mobile phones has

886
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,079
been consistently documented in between

887
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,660
50 and 75 percent of our testimonies

888
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,720
each year since 2017 but what we're

889
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,400
seeing recently in for example

890
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,740
Lighthouse reports investigations is p

891
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,180
people on the Move filming the

892
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,680
violations that are being enacted

893
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,660
against them to prove that these

894
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,060
violations are occurring so not only is

895
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,160
technology being used against them but

896
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,780
the technology that they might use to

897
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,700
empower themselves to record violations

898
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,040
is being stripped of them so we have

899
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,220
these two concurrent Trends happening

900
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,859
but then we also have new technologies

901
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,020
that are being weaponized to facilitate

902
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,900
border violence and illegal pushbacks so

903
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,480
across our database we see a range of

904
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,800
different types of surveillance

905
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,040
equipment being used and we also see a

906
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,339
biometric uh information being gathered

907
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,560
from people on the move so we have

908
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,420
widespread collection of the personal

909
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,240
data of persons prior to their pushbacks

910
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,520
often when they're held in detention so

911
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,380
people's fingerprints are being taken

912
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,140
photographs of them their countries of

913
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,880
origin are being asked they're being

914
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,180
forced to sign papers so in our database

915
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,160
respondents were forced to sign papers

916
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,339
in 17 of all testimonies normally those

917
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,099
are untranslated they were photographed

918
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,400
in 24 of all testimonies and had their

919
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,280
fingerprints taken in 15 of all

920
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,339
testimonies and on top of this various

921
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:56,099
testimonies point to a breach of EU data

922
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,900
protection regulation by frontex

923
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,300
officers specifically we have a number

924
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,579
of testimonies where respondents claim

925
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,980
that frontex officers or officers that

926
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,040
they identified as frontext took visual

927
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,960
footage of them during apprehension

928
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,900
often on their personal phones and these

929
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,880
forms of data collection are virtually

930
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,800
never accompanied with clear and

931
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,380
informed consent translation about the

932
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,720
procedures that are happening nor with

933
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,119
uh nor with any information about the

934
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,099
purpose of the collection or how it will

935
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,500
be processed none of this is articulated

936
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,660
to the people who these procedures are

937
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,579
being applied to and these are all

938
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,740
violations under current EU legislation

939
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,440
around the collection of biometric data

940
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,359
but an even more violent usage of

941
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,980
technology and pushbacks comes in the

942
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,839
form of drones and thermal imaging

943
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,000
cameras either Standalone or attached to

944
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
surveillance Vehicles so since 2018 we

945
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,339
have collected 36 testimonies where

946
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,680
respondents mentioned drones prior to an

947
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,420
apprehension that then results in a

948
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,760
pushback and that affects approximately

949
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,119
over 1 000 people because all of our

950
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,280
testimonies are group testimonies so

951
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,280
each one refers to a wider Transit group

952
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,560
so there are drones that are being flown

953
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,020
in Border areas often accompanied with

954
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,359
thermal imaging sensors to detect groups

955
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,400
to then go and find them and illegally

956
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,760
push them back so obviously this is how

957
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,099
technology is being used against and

958
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,980
weaponized against people on the move on

959
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,320
top of this drones are collecting vast

960
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,839
amounts of data and the way they operate

961
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,119
makes it virtually impossible for

962
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,619
individuals to be aware that they're

963
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,660
even being surveilled which obviously

964
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,880
raises ethical concerns as well as

965
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,460
potential human rights Human Rights and

966
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,099
Freedom infringement around freedom from

967
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,920
discrimination the right to privacy data

968
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,020
protection issues and impacts on civil

969
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,119
liberties and human dignity

970
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,920
but this is not just happening in one

971
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,079
border area or just a few border areas

972
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,240
we've recorded these kinds of

973
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,280
Technologies used to detect and push

974
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,140
back people on the Move in Croatia

975
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,320
Greece North Macedonia Hungary Bulgaria

976
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,079
Serbia and Romania so this is happening

977
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,780
across the region and across the route

978
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,700
so this again brings us back to the

979
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,800
point that new technologies are not

980
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,900
inherently bad these drones and thermal

981
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,880
imaging cameras like I said before might

982
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,800
be used to detect people at risk and

983
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,480
organize search and rescue operations

984
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,300
but they're not being used for this and

985
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,859
I'll just quickly come back to the AI

986
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,480
act on that because one of the huge

987
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,460
issues that we are seeing is that all of

988
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,680
the obligations are being placed on

989
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,020
developers and creators of the AI

990
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,880
systems and there's virtually no

991
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,339
obligations on users so the issue is

992
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,320
that the it's the usage of things like

993
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,060
drones that are being weaponized against

994
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,740
people on the move not the drones

995
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,500
themselves so this Gap in accountability

996
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,240
for users is also a massively

997
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,920
problematic issue

998
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,380
and I'll leave it there for now

999
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,859
thank you hope um yeah you gave

1000
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,680
um great and terrifying overview What's

1001
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,560
um happening on the region of the

1002
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,119
western Balkan State the so-called back

1003
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,440
on Route

1004
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,960
um the important work of Border violence

1005
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,180
monitoring Network and

1006
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,700
um so thank you uh for being here and

1007
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,640
sharing with all of us your work and

1008
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,440
also thank you for pointing out this

1009
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,380
very very important aspect of the

1010
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,680
regulation of AI based systems which is

1011
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,260
the context of use and which is critical

1012
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,220
when we are advocating for and including

1013
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,579
high risk list of systems because as you

1014
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,440
pointed out it's it's not about the

1015
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,420
technology per se but the use and the

1016
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,280
example that you that you gave about

1017
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,280
drones is it's it's it's instrumental we

1018
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,740
have Sea Watch

1019
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,440
conducting certain rescue operation with

1020
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,359
the use of drones but we have front

1021
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,079
decks using drones to indicate the

1022
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,119
position investors to the Libyan Coast

1023
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,280
Guard and facilitating a pullback

1024
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,640
towards the Libyan Shores

1025
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,500
so and I invite everyone later just to

1026
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,440
come here and take a look to this

1027
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,440
massive piece of work

1028
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,560
um in the last 20 minutes that we are

1029
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,420
given if we want to have some space Also

1030
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,460
for questions if you if you have for our

1031
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,060
speakers we would like to zoom a bit out

1032
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,319
from the AI act and look more in general

1033
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,480
uh to other pieces of European

1034
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,240
legislations which are legalizing and

1035
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,319
normalizing the use of Border technology

1036
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:29,760
and the reason why I would like to do

1037
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,760
this exercise is to show how pervasive

1038
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,839
uh

1039
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,720
these normalization process is and that

1040
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,420
we should all be aware and be able to

1041
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,280
connect the dots between

1042
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,099
racist and oppressive migration

1043
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,160
policies and digital files

1044
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,480
so to go back to the same

1045
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,480
order as before I would like to ask

1046
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,380
every one of our speakers what other

1047
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,260
um EU legislative files we should look

1048
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,160
at when we want to monitor the rise of

1049
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,500
Border attack and I would like to start

1050
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,140
with Simona since you have a quite broad

1051
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,079
overview of this intersection of

1052
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,099
migration and digital files thank you

1053
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,560
thanks well yes we've already heard that

1054
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,040
it's being facilitated and legitimized

1055
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,660
um by the commission by the member

1056
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,220
states and we see this in funding but

1057
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,260
now also in laws and not only in one

1058
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,040
because the AI act already legitimizes a

1059
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,920
couple of very worrying uses the emotion

1060
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,740
recognition the LIE detectors the risk

1061
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,599
profiling in the context of migration

1062
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,220
but

1063
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,079
um it's spread across all different

1064
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,060
files because what I'm very worried

1065
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,700
about is the Schengen borders code where

1066
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,400
in the revision Article 13 now says that

1067
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,160
in the case of instrumentalization of

1068
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,099
migrants those are situations like we're

1069
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,680
in Belarus

1070
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,720
when they were sending people over the

1071
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,839
border to Poland they call that

1072
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,280
instrumentalization of migrants which

1073
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,359
already I find quite a dehumanizing term

1074
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,880
um now the commission gives the member

1075
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,200
states a huge discretion to send mobile

1076
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,540
units

1077
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,380
drones and all kinds of sensors to the

1078
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,780
borders to reinforce the borders and yes

1079
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,319
as the previous panelists already said

1080
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,240
obviously what they're doing there is to

1081
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,180
facilitate pushbacks it's not to welcome

1082
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,260
them with uh food blankets and a safe

1083
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,540
environment and health checks it's to

1084
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,160
make sure they don't cross the border

1085
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,000
and this is in law they can may use all

1086
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,160
technical means so that's when I'm very

1087
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,599
worried about

1088
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,819
and another worrying development apart

1089
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,140
from the AI Act and the Schengen

1090
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Borden's code is that I see that these

1091
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,819
huge databases we've been speaking about

1092
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,520
and there are really many that

1093
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,500
increasingly all being linked to each

1094
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,839
other we see already in europol that

1095
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,220
currently there's another interesting

1096
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,440
session about that

1097
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,480
um they're basically using all these

1098
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,960
huge databases to be able to train AI on

1099
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,599
it in the future and use that in very

1100
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,819
dangerous ways as we saw for example in

1101
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,280
the Child Benefits affair

1102
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,079
um and in the screening regulation that

1103
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,300
for example tunica's Shadow on so I'm

1104
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,760
working on for the digital aspects we

1105
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,460
also see these databases coming back

1106
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,040
constantly and we initially voted

1107
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,900
against these databases in the first

1108
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,460
place because we think they're really

1109
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,020
dangerous and don't contain enough

1110
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,260
safeguards but now we see in all the

1111
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,020
future legislation as well all these

1112
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,359
databases are now an established fact

1113
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,599
and constantly coming back and screening

1114
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,980
for example

1115
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,680
one of the first steps is check all the

1116
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,200
databases and we're trying to push back

1117
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,000
and say okay but then it shouldn't have

1118
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,460
any new consequences people shouldn't

1119
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,339
then suddenly be rejected while they're

1120
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:06,920
effectively

1121
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,940
non-entry enter entered into the

1122
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,980
territory yet

1123
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,020
um but it's really I found that really

1124
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,040
worrying

1125
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,920
what a small POS what brings a small

1126
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,619
positive note of Hope is that I see that

1127
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,520
especially since I think in

1128
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,760
2020 one in around July there were huge

1129
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,500
reports about

1130
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
sound cannons at the border to push

1131
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,579
people back lie detectors uh by EU

1132
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,599
funded and I think this did shock at

1133
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,460
least lawmakers in the European

1134
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,780
Parliament

1135
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,599
from left and even at that time to write

1136
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,260
we convinced them to to come in with us

1137
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,760
and ask questions to the European

1138
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,980
commission about this how is it funded

1139
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,079
and I think the more dystopian these

1140
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,079
Technologies get the less

1141
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,319
we see room to justify them and for

1142
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,000
example in the screening regulation and

1143
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,319
it's really compared to all the

1144
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,720
disastrous developments only a tiny step

1145
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,319
but it under negotiation now we have

1146
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,060
included in the screening regulation at

1147
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,579
least a part where

1148
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,859
um biometric recognition biometric

1149
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:20,280
categorization Predictive Analytics lie

1150
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,260
detectors and sound cannons will be

1151
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,720
prohibited in at least the screening

1152
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,540
facilities and reception areas so this

1153
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,619
is a tiny first step of Hope towards uh

1154
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,260
well a different approach to these

1155
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,760
Technologies

1156
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,740
thank you Simona and thank you for

1157
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,020
ending on a helpful note because clearly

1158
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,500
we need some some of that and yeah thank

1159
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,900
you for um giving some of these examples

1160
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,880
screening regulation Schengen borders

1161
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,660
code and also raising the issue of the

1162
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,180
Horizon 2020 funded projects and how

1163
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,599
they are the basis for legitimizing some

1164
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,240
of this technology I would like now to

1165
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,980
ask niovi what do you think are the

1166
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,560
other pieces of Regulation or policy

1167
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,460
making that we should be looking at

1168
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,500
um well if there was a glimpse of Hope

1169
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,140
prepare to have it uh completely

1170
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,440
uh yeah so you've been hearing a lot

1171
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,319
about databases and uh one thing to note

1172
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,240
is that there are six of them and

1173
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,460
they're going to be interconnected the

1174
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,500
problem is that the three of them are

1175
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,599
currently developed and the other three

1176
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:33,660
are under development including they are

1177
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,000
what's called interoperability I'm not

1178
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,160
gonna go through that there is I wrote

1179
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,380
700 pages from this I'm not going to

1180
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:44,400
discuss it now but uh because this uh

1181
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,980
pieces of legislation are still not

1182
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,800
fully enforced because the databases are

1183
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,460
under development we are we we have

1184
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,119
things to wait for so entry exit system

1185
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,819
etias the equivalent of Vesta or avetta

1186
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:04,280
for Canada and Australia

1187
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,839
and

1188
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,339
interoperability it means that the

1189
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,079
database are going to be interconnected

1190
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,200
but it's more than that essentially what

1191
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,079
we've come to understand is that because

1192
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,619
we have the databases interoperability

1193
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:20,940
allowed the use of artificial

1194
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,880
intelligence when you have separate

1195
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,500
databases you can't have entered

1196
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,400
interoperability in artificial

1197
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,339
intelligence being in place and then

1198
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,640
there's more that's not it the piece of

1199
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,220
the legislation themselves doesn't say

1200
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,880
everything so there is a huge amount of

1201
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,280
delegated and implementing acts and by

1202
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,280
that I mean more than 50 which are

1203
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,440
currently negotiated without the

1204
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,000
involvement of the European Parliament

1205
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,319
because they are delegated and

1206
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,680
implementing acts and many of them are

1207
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,619
not even published so we can have even

1208
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,980
access to see what is being discussed

1209
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,859
even with access of information requests

1210
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:08,579
they are not giving us the access to

1211
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,980
even the proposals because for security

1212
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,760
reasons and if that's not bad enough we

1213
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,160
have new piece of legislation because

1214
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,160
migration is only a part of a big puzzle

1215
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,920
mobility in itself is an inherently

1216
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,200
suspicious activity and it's not just

1217
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,619
migrants who are a problem but the

1218
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,780
mobile person so a new piece of

1219
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,480
legislation is the European passenger

1220
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,339
information

1221
00:51:34,339 --> 00:51:37,260
regulation it's actually a proposal of

1222
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,180
two regulations one for migration

1223
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,339
purposes and one for law enforcement and

1224
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:46,619
in uh the near future they're going to

1225
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:48,480
be changes in the exchange of

1226
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,980
information for the second information

1227
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,619
system and something that I find it

1228
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:55,440
completely confusing the exchange of

1229
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,260
Border guards with information with

1230
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,319
their counterparts in third countries

1231
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,200
at the border so someone arrives and

1232
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,640
then the Border guard will have the

1233
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,720
possibility to speak to the Libyan the

1234
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,280
Tunisian counterpart on Exchange of

1235
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,079
information I found it's completely

1236
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,420
scary but still we're waiting for that

1237
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,700
proposal their chest consultation at the

1238
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,200
moment so

1239
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,300
there is a lot of work to be done and

1240
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,460
the fight never stops

1241
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,380
yes Hope destroyed but um yeah a lot of

1242
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,380
work to be done and and an organization

1243
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,680
uh to coordinate thank you I was not

1244
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,660
aware of this last example you gave so

1245
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,059
the picture is getting like um more and

1246
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:39,960
more

1247
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,920
um porcupine so Alina what do you think

1248
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,140
are the things that we should look at on

1249
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,619
top of of the elements that nyavi talked

1250
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:50,640
about

1251
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,520
well my colleague Marta in peacom has

1252
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,020
also been following the the Schengen

1253
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,240
border code

1254
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,619
revision and uh shares the concerns that

1255
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:02,940
have already been expressed and I think

1256
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,160
it's it's interesting and maybe relevant

1257
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,780
to also just underscore that the

1258
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,059
commission itself has acknowledged that

1259
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,740
the new measures increase the risk of

1260
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,359
racial profiling and discriminatory

1261
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,460
selection of persons being checked in

1262
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,680
Border zones so this is something

1263
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,040
this this is something understood uh by

1264
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,260
those who prepared The Proposal that um

1265
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,359
that these risks exist of perpetuating

1266
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:27,599
further uh discrimination so that the

1267
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,099
the other things that I was going to

1268
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,380
note are not maybe so much legislative

1269
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,619
files but more kind of programs

1270
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,319
um that that I know that others in this

1271
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,119
conference today are following closely

1272
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,440
in terms of how europol for example is

1273
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,960
also part of this whole picture on the

1274
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,280
processing of data for immigration

1275
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,380
control linked to what we've heard about

1276
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,859
these Mega databases on migration and so

1277
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,180
some of you may have heard about this

1278
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,119
Pedra program processing of personal

1279
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,640
data for risk analysis again this idea

1280
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,760
of risk coming back into this

1281
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,500
and the intention is that front tax

1282
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,839
officers would gather information about

1283
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,260
migrants about those who are suspected

1284
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,700
of being involved in smuggling

1285
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,000
trafficking or terrorism

1286
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,819
um and this data is shared and processed

1287
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,859
together with europol

1288
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,680
um and according to a report by the by

1289
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,800
Balkan insight

1290
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,500
frontex has shared more than 11 the

1291
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,599
personal data of more than 11

1292
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:33,300
000 people with europol between 2016 and

1293
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,940
2021 and my understanding is that since

1294
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,339
2021 when the data we're speaking about

1295
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:40,559
includes

1296
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,599
at least the possibility of connecting

1297
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,020
collecting genetic data and alongside

1298
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,240
biometric data information about

1299
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,160
religious beliefs and sexual orientation

1300
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,500
so I mean we're really talking about

1301
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,079
sweeping amounts of personal data that

1302
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,579
are collected in the context of this

1303
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:58,079
program

1304
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,700
um and then maybe just another program

1305
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,300
that um that I myself had only just

1306
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,520
learned about that was operating in

1307
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,260
parallel your poll program called

1308
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,559
secondary Security checks

1309
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:11,640
involving the use of facial recognition

1310
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,380
technology in camps in Greece and Italy

1311
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,700
that is extended to other countries

1312
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,520
again with the purpose of identifying

1313
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,319
so-called suspected terrorists and

1314
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:22,280
criminals so I think again we see this

1315
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,720
notion of

1316
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,640
um

1317
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,819
of identifying suspects of crimes being

1318
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:33,839
completely co-mingled with migrants and

1319
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,119
immigration in a way that is really

1320
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:38,339
justifying the use of increasingly

1321
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,700
invasive Technologies

1322
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,520
so I think and oftentimes very very

1323
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,260
opaque in terms of the nature of these

1324
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,660
programs

1325
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,099
so yeah I think those are some

1326
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,079
additional developments that

1327
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,220
um

1328
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,520
fortunately there are

1329
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,700
um there I guess for me the the spark of

1330
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,980
hope is precisely that there are people

1331
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,380
here today who are following these

1332
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,540
issues who are paying attention and

1333
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,880
increasingly working together

1334
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,520
um to really try to to come up with ways

1335
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,760
to uh to to respond

1336
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,800
um to react to give visibility there's

1337
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,599
increasingly attention to these issues

1338
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,480
by journalistic groups by investigative

1339
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,480
journalism so I think that is what gives

1340
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,300
me hope because so much of this is so

1341
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,000
hidden and is so easy to kind of just

1342
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
absorb as part of the status quo about

1343
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,460
how migration policy works and we're

1344
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,140
starting I think to see more and more

1345
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,200
people realizing what's going on and

1346
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,420
really being concerned and being

1347
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,980
mobilized around trying to do something

1348
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,500
so that is my spark of hope in this

1349
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,240
context but there's a heck of a lot of

1350
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,160
work to do

1351
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,440
thank you Lena and thank you for closing

1352
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,960
with this spark of hope

1353
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,559
um which yeah it's it's clearly like um

1354
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,720
collaborating working together it's

1355
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,059
clearly a necessity because as you are

1356
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:05,040
all proving right now

1357
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,760
um The Border industrial complex is

1358
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,579
scattered all around is not only in the

1359
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:14,880
Air Act but in in many different places

1360
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,640
so um it's indeed a necessity to work

1361
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,020
together and maybe destroying a bit of

1362
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,280
Hope but

1363
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,859
um hope could you tell us what we should

1364
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,619
be looking at yeah so I was also going

1365
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,059
to mention the Schengen borders code

1366
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,220
reform so obviously we're all aware that

1367
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,500
that's a very important file

1368
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,160
um but yeah I think the cat the

1369
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,020
instrumentalization regulation together

1370
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,059
with that and the articles about

1371
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,680
instrumentalization in the Schengen

1372
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,020
borders code speak specifically about

1373
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,599
increased usage of new technologies and

1374
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,460
about an increased role of frontex who

1375
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,780
would have control over those new

1376
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,819
technologies so this is a really

1377
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:55,619
important area to focus but some

1378
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:58,140
tentative hope is that the draft report

1379
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,500
that came came out the Articles around

1380
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,180
instrumentalization were removed so we

1381
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,980
just have to hope that they stay removed

1382
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,200
in the following debates but that's a

1383
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,720
small bit of Hope and there's also in

1384
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,339
the Schengen borders code reform a lot

1385
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:13,559
about internal readmissions within

1386
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:16,020
States within Schengen and those would

1387
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:20,220
rely heavily on racist policing and risk

1388
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,200
policing which we wrote a paper about

1389
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,619
with asji who have documented at the

1390
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,500
Italian border people being profiled

1391
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,240
based on their race and then checked for

1392
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,440
their documents and then being

1393
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,260
internally referred returned which is an

1394
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,960
illegal pushback to Slovenia and then

1395
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,280
obviously we have cases of chain

1396
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,740
reefalment all the way from Italy to

1397
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,200
Slovenia to Croatia back to Bosnia so

1398
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,299
and all of this is facilitated by racist

1399
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:47,460
policing and new technologies and that's

1400
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,140
all legislated for in the Schengen

1401
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,819
borders code reforms so we definitely

1402
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,559
have to keep an eye on if those things

1403
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,960
are brought back in during the

1404
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,960
negotiations another very important area

1405
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,319
is again not necessarily a particular

1406
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,819
piece of legislation but again going

1407
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:05,099
back to databases this is something that

1408
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:07,920
we are monitoring very closely with the

1409
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,799
new so-called bulk and DAC system so

1410
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,440
we've obviously seen since 2017 an

1411
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,140
increasing externalization into the

1412
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,839
Western Balkan region of the eu's

1413
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,880
migration problem so trying to put

1414
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,920
people back in Serbia in Bosnia in

1415
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,119
Albania and giving these states funding

1416
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,740
through the IPA the instrument for

1417
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,240
pre-excession and giving them all

1418
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,359
candidacy status for accession and what

1419
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,119
we're now seeing is the promise that

1420
00:59:36,119 --> 00:59:38,819
there will be databases made in these

1421
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:41,400
Western Balkan states which people are

1422
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,160
calling the bulk and DAC which will then

1423
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,099
be with a view to be interoperable and

1424
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,799
interconnected with eurodac but there's

1425
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,079
no guarantee that that will be

1426
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,480
post-accession so there's no guarantee

1427
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,339
that these databases will be regulated

1428
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:58,380
by EU legislation because they're taking

1429
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,980
place outside of EU member states and

1430
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,020
the only people who technically have

1431
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,780
access to these databases is frontex

1432
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,579
frontex can access the national

1433
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,160
databases in the areas of operation and

1434
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,740
can access eurodac obviously we know the

1435
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,900
huge issues with frontex given the Olaf

1436
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,900
report that came out that they are

1437
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,359
complicit in illegal pushbacks at the

1438
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,180
very least so allowing frontext to have

1439
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,240
access to these two different databases

1440
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,819
which are not necessarily legislated for

1441
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:32,220
under EU law is a blatant violation so

1442
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,500
this area of databases and further

1443
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,540
externalization into the Western Balkans

1444
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,760
to set up this sort of hotspot approach

1445
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,400
whereby people can be fingerprinted in

1446
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,319
the Balkans then found in member states

1447
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:45,540
then returned to the Balkans then the

1448
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,339
Balkans become this hot spot region

1449
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,020
where we're Outsourcing our migration

1450
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,760
management there so that's something

1451
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,260
that's very important to keep an eye on

1452
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,119
re databases

1453
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,960
thanks not very hopeful sorry

1454
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,420
not very hopeful but certainly important

1455
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,299
um yeah to raise also how maybe

1456
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:05,940
migration policies try to reinforce idea

1457
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,099
that we have borders but at the same

1458
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:10,200
time this kind of collaborations seems

1459
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,760
not to have borders

1460
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,380
um since there is the expansion of

1461
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,859
digital surveillance beyond the European

1462
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:19,680
geographical borders so this is a really

1463
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,079
important

1464
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:24,359
example that you gave thank you so it

1465
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:28,559
seems that we were perfectly on time to

1466
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,339
save some some minutes for questions

1467
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:34,740
um I'm sure you received a lot of

1468
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,180
information

1469
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,819
um so I see that we have some hands

1470
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:42,599
raised already one two and three so I'll

1471
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,500
give you the microphone

1472
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,359
can I please ask you to mention whether

1473
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,040
your question is for one particular

1474
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,160
speaker or for all of them

1475
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,020
thank you very much Ariel thank you very

1476
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,640
much for the very interesting panel

1477
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,760
Sarah presyani from aromat rights uh

1478
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,760
it's not too specific person but it's

1479
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,200
more related to the second question

1480
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,780
which other legislative file because

1481
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,780
looking at the migration context we see

1482
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,099
the external Dimension the

1483
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:16,140
externalization policy is the pillar now

1484
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,680
of the EU policy so and mainly related

1485
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,780
to border management so we are providing

1486
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,520
all these

1487
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,040
um Tech tools among them all artificial

1488
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,960
intelligence one two countries such as

1489
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,119
Egypt Libya Tunisia you have been

1490
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,040
mentioning the collaboration with the

1491
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,079
Libyan Indonesian Coast Guard so I would

1492
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,780
like to have more information on in

1493
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:39,720
which policy framework is for seeing

1494
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,160
this kind of collaboration but more

1495
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,220
generally which kind of way to challenge

1496
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,799
the use of you budget for providing this

1497
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,440
kind of tools for Border management to

1498
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,780
Third Country that related human rights

1499
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,420
and their citizen rights and migrants

1500
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,220
and Refugee Rights and I'm thinking on

1501
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,460
countries such as turkey Libya Egypt and

1502
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,559

the maternal region thank you

1504
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,160
do you want to answer now or do you want

1505
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,180
to take a couple more questions

1506
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,400
can I see okay

1507
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,619
uh thank you so my name is halit Kayan

1508
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:21,780
I'm a researcher at Kai Learning Center

1509
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,859
for writing iplo I have one question and

1510
01:03:25,859 --> 01:03:28,920
one comment or no ask comment or counter

1511
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,619
argument so I'll start with the last one

1512
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,200
okay I'll start I'll only ask the

1513
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,119
question

1514
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,460
uh okay so

1515
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,299
um

1516
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:42,480
so Alina mentioned that uh Charter or

1517
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,460
fundamental rights and and European

1518
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,079
conventional human rights apply to

1519
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,119
everyone but EU currently tries to

1520
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,540
circumvent them by referring to criminal

1521
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,579
procedures or security and nearly

1522
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,380
imagine that there's not much case law

1523
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,720
right now but all these all these issues

1524
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,859
we are discussing right now and

1525
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:03,900
other speakers also mentioned similar

1526
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,520
things like Simone mentioned on

1527
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,359
transparency and and hope mentioned

1528
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:10,980
pushbacks and we are actually talking

1529
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,579
right now here about not so when we talk

1530
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:18,780
when we say pushbacks we should uh we

1531
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,520
should accept the fact that we are we

1532
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,799
are talking about killings not always

1533
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,460
maybe but also also killings and

1534
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:29,280
some people may find my my thoughts very

1535
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,059
bold but uh migration the the use

1536
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:35,880
approach to migration is kind of in my

1537
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,980
opinion the the greatest failure of

1538
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,660
European values and and European idea

1539
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,500
RPM project and

1540
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,760
I wonder

1541
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,480
um whether you you are aware of any case

1542
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,859
law uh to be to be produced soon or or

1543
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,540
you think

1544
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:01,619
um there will be some some some change I

1545
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:04,140
mean not change but some some case law

1546
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,460
uh showing that uh such such practices

1547
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,220
or such and such an Air Act will go

1548
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,579
against the human dignity uh the the the

1549
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,540
the the the right to live and and all

1550
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,599
other fundamental human rights and also

1551
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,599
I would like to ask everyone here uh

1552
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:28,260
whether you are planning or currently

1553
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,220
doing any any work on uh legislative

1554
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,280
procedures for example right now I I'm

1555
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,440
well aware of the fact that access now

1556
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,559
does much on this area for example or

1557
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,339
other ngos or address so do you do you

1558
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:47,099
plan to I don't know logic file or

1559
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,119
anything or or support anyone uh

1560
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,280
suffering from these these kind of

1561
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,660
mistreatments and uh and yeah I think I

1562
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,780
should I should make it not any longer

1563
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,920
thank you

1564
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,140
thank you and we had another question

1565
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,059
hello

1566
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:13,920
um this could be answered by anyone and

1567
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,299
everyone

1568
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:17,220
um I really want to take it back to the

1569
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,980
The Hope and practical applications of

1570
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,559
this because it's great to be here and

1571
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,380
be well informed but you want this to

1572
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:27,180
translate into kind of mobilization

1573
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,520
Grassroots mobilization

1574
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,099
and I really wanted the panel to speak

1575
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:35,160
to that because uh we've seen the

1576
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,839
Overton Windows shift even further right

1577
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:39,599
and migration is often a proxy for you

1578
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,760
know it's it's a shorthand for

1579
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,500
center right

1580
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,680
Woods to the far right to kind of

1581
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:50,280
distract from economic discontent and

1582
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,660
unfortunately the times we're living in

1583
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,420
now that's easily weaponized as we see

1584
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,280
in across Europe

1585
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,599
um Continental Europe as well as in the

1586
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:58,740
UK

1587
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,780
and so unfortunately you have people

1588
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,240
even who are

1589
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,559
who are descendants and migrants of

1590
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,480
cells who will parrot these kind of

1591
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,200
far-right rhetoric or or very migrant

1592
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,599
suspicious rhetoric and so I'm trying to

1593
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:14,700
and I don't have as much hope in the EU

1594
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,500
projects or the EU value system because

1595
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,000
when you have senior EU officials

1596
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,400
talking about Europe being a garden that

1597
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,720
needs to keep out the jungle and the

1598
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,220
rest of the world I I don't think I

1599
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,599
think that reflects really the True

1600
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,660
Values more so than any other kind of um

1601
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,660
uh official rhetoric about

1602
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:33,119
um uh about respecting

1603
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:33,900
um

1604
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,700
um rights across the board regardless of

1605
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,220
origin so I guess I'm just asking what

1606
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,039
would you

1607
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:43,020
in terms of mobilizing the Grassroots

1608
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,760
and getting people to getting the public

1609
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,200
need to shift

1610
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,819
because this is where you can this is

1611
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:49,020
where you have the resistance this is

1612
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,240
where you have the backlash and Alina

1613
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,039
gave an example of a small victory in

1614
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,420
Holland

1615
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,700
um in terms of a racist policy that was

1616
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,920
kind of shut down because of you know of

1617
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,500
the of the um resistance from the public

1618
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,440
so uh and also just for us here what can

1619
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,480
we do to kind of

1620
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,140
um facilitate uh some kind of uh

1621
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,000
Grassroots movement to make sure that

1622
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
these uh dehumanizing policies don't see

1623
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,100
the light of day thanks

1624
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,140
thank you and we've got five minutes

1625
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,359
left so I'll give it to the speakers

1626
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,040
whether you want to answer these

1627
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,020
questions maybe or take more yeah okay

1628
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,439
that um you all maybe will take

1629
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,380
one minute to answer the questions and

1630
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,779
you decide what I'm going to pick but

1631
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,100
thank you everyone for these very

1632
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,920
interesting comments and questions

1633
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,140
um does anyone wants to start or should

1634
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,759
we follow the order Simona do you want

1635
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:47,279
to go first yeah fine to go first and

1636
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:49,920
I'll try and keep it very brief to

1637
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,839
answer the first speaker on the funding

1638
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,880
of these Technologies this is something

1639
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,920
where also really very worried about and

1640
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,560
what we're doing now especially is Case

1641
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,960
by case written questions

1642
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,500
um on specific cases of bizarre border

1643
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,719
Technologies we encounter also again

1644
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,439
with thanks to Civil Society

1645
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:13,020
investigative journalists academics so

1646
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,600
that also combines my answer with the

1647
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,080
the last question how can we keep up the

1648
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,600
good work mobilize people

1649
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,759
um change the public opinion I think is

1650
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,620
really bringing these cases to light

1651
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,198
because the more we know about these

1652
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,880
bizarre

1653
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,460
um practices at the board orders around

1654
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,698
reception areas during screening and

1655
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:38,698
assigning procedures the more the

1656
01:09:38,698 --> 01:09:41,460
outrage about it is fueled I think and

1657
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,560
uh um well on the funding we're really

1658
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,120
trying to get X anti-fundamental rights

1659
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,560
conditionality in because now what

1660
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,479
happens is the answer to all our written

1661
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:54,000
questions are well we don't fund things

1662
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,400
in violation of fundamental rights but

1663
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,280
it's up to the member State itself to

1664
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,380
look into fundamental rights violations

1665
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,960
by itself

1666
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,640
right

1667
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,980
doesn't sound very convincing so for us

1668
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,840
the thing we're really trying to push is

1669
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,000
X anti-fundamental rights conditionality

1670
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,880
to EU funding and especially in these

1671
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,340
Innovation and Border funds

1672
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,800
and on the court cases I wouldn't really

1673
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,100
know but Shameless promo Tina gastric is

1674
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:27,480
a migration professor and has a Blog in

1675
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,880
which she shares all her legal views so

1676
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,260
maybe there might be interesting stuff

1677
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,540
on there sometime soon thank you very

1678
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,340
much

1679
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:38,040
you have one minute I know uh on cases

1680
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,500
uh one case when I border control

1681
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,020
program or not on the fundamental rights

1682
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,800
problems but on transparency

1683
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,880
irrespect of

1684
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,920
um having documentation about impact

1685
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,140
assessments or the new funded research

1686
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,560
project Patrick should be here today I

1687
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,719
saw him on the program he is he's

1688
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:00,600
litigating the case and one case

1689
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,520
relating to machine learning click the

1690
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,080
dry man on PNR and there it prohibits

1691
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,980
self-learning systems which aren't

1692
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,260
supervised but this is the only thing

1693
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,820
and this case has already been

1694
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:15,120
criticized as unrealistic

1695
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,199
um with regard to mobilization and there

1696
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,600
are many ways unfortunately I believe

1697
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,400
that unless it becomes personal to

1698
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,679
European citizens they will not get that

1699
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,159
much mobilized that's why I think that

1700
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,380
these Technologies are only tested on

1701
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,600
migrants and if they become also applied

1702
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,120
on citizens and then people are going to

1703
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,280
become more mobilized unfortunately in

1704
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,760
the meantime strategic litigation I wait

1705
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,460
for that email that there is an

1706
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,760
applicant that we can take it to court

1707
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,219
and finally there is a fundamental

1708
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,140
rights agency e-learning tool being

1709
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:54,239
developed at the moment by myself and a

1710
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,880
colleague which will provide more

1711
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,880
Awareness on people and that's it

1712
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,420
fantastic job uh see all of this in a

1713
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,000
minute and 10 seconds Alina are you up

1714
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,739
for the challenge

1715
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:10,620
so I'm so glad we were asked about what

1716
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,199
the role is of potential litigation and

1717
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,460
I'm so glad we were asked about

1718
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,380
mobilization and Grassroots I mean all

1719
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,900
of it all of it has to happen

1720
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,880
um I mean I'm not an expert but my sense

1721
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,440
is part of the challenges as we heard

1722
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,640
earlier that as far as these

1723
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,280
interoperable systems these are what

1724
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,719
we're dealing with not only in terms of

1725
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:28,980
those but in terms of any of these this

1726
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,140
is EU level legislation that itself is

1727
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,179
in conflict with itself so we have the

1728
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:34,500
gdpr we have the law enforcement

1729
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,760
directive on the one hand we have the

1730
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,679
charter fundamental rights and then we

1731
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,719
have this other legislation that seems

1732
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:43,199
to actually just like

1733
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,480
forget that that exists so it's about

1734
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,360
how do you we also the opportunities to

1735
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,719
actually challenge EU legislation but I

1736
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:53,280
think at the national level in terms of

1737
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,480
implementation not all of it's

1738
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,760
implemented yet but we already see some

1739
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,719
work

1740
01:12:57,719 --> 01:12:58,500
um

1741
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,900
Homer digitalis for example challenging

1742
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,480
the Greek smart policing program before

1743
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,060
the DPA the the national level data

1744
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,640
protection office so I think there are

1745
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,320
opportunities

1746
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,199
to do more at the national level where

1747
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,179
we already see implementation happening

1748
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:18,300
in a widespread way mobilization there

1749
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,739
are really important challenges because

1750
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:21,480
of how opaque a lot of this is because

1751
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,640
how complicated a lot of it seems but

1752
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,020
again what we were saying earlier I

1753
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,820
think we're starting to it's really

1754
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,739
important to connect the dots that this

1755
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,739
is not fundamentally technical

1756
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,420
technological issue this is a racial

1757
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,699
justice issue a migrant rights issue a

1758
01:13:35,699 --> 01:13:38,100
democracy issue so our existing

1759
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,260
movements need to find ways to speak to

1760
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:45,000
each other and to to the Grassroots as

1761
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,800
well and actually tomorrow we have a

1762
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,060
session with peacom's membership

1763
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,159
together with your med rights to have

1764
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,840
that dialogue together about how this

1765
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,460
work at the EU level connects with their

1766
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,900
experience

1767
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,080
fantastic job thanks hope okay I will

1768
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,699
try to just really quickly say two

1769
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,100
things so first of all in terms of the

1770
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,900
externalization and all the funding to

1771
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,340
third countries

1772
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,440
um to go an even higher level to the

1773
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,360
international level the UN is also now

1774
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,520
developing its focus on new technologies

1775
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,860
they're creating a global digital

1776
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,739
compact this year so that's the kind of

1777
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,239
instrument that maybe it's useful to

1778
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,920
look at those mechanisms at the

1779
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,260
international level what can the EU be

1780
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,080
mandated through un procedures

1781
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,699
um they're even currently looking into

1782
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:29,280
the use of new technologies in enforced

1783
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,260
disappearances so in pushbacks

1784
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,060
essentially so it's really important to

1785
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,320
look at what's developing on the UN

1786
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,760
level

1787
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,800
um as well and I'll just jump to the

1788
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,739
last question quickly so our all of our

1789
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:43,380
testimonies are public we it's one of

1790
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,360
the largest open source databases in

1791
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,400
Europe and lots of people have used this

1792
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,040
as a resource so we've had people create

1793
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:52,920
theater plays out of our testimonies

1794
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,480
print them off take them to government

1795
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,179
build things use them in protests so

1796
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:59,100
obviously this huge book we don't have

1797
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,560
that many copies of but the database

1798
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,199
itself is online and we create this open

1799
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,420
source evidence for people to use in

1800
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,699
different forms of mobilization it's all

1801
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:10,920
public so use it in all different forms

1802
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,600
of Grassroots mobilization it's all

1803
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,420
there for you to use thank you

1804
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,100
thank you

1805
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,860
um thanks everyone thank you speakers

1806
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,960
for sharing your knowledge your

1807
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,540
experiences your expertise thank you for

1808
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,360
being here it was a great discussion

1809
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,380
um yeah
