00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,500
privacy Camp is

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,380
um this is the Brussels activist

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,920
conference Gathering Civil Society

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,200
Academia industry and decision makers

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,280
including EU officials to strategize and

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,680
learn about human rights and privacy in

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,540
the digital age

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,400
um

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
privacy Camp is meant to be a free

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,740
accessible conference pre-cpdp

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,020
unfortunately now since the pandemic

41
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,900
cpdp has been moved to may but we hope

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,880
that in the future we managed to gather

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,240
the two events again together

44
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,579
but as technology is becoming a more and

45
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,700
more important part of our lives

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,259
and that's our relations to technology

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,200
has evolved so has privacy Camp so I'm

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,320
really pleased to see old friends as

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060
well as newcomers people from Human

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,580
Rights organizations from social justice

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,860
and climate Justice groups as well so

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,319
just could I have a quick show of hands

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,300
as to who is attending privacy camp for

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,840
the first time

55
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,360
yeah

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
quite a few new people and how about

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
those who've attended already privacy

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,459
camps online or

59
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,680
all right

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,660
okay thank you that's quite interesting

61
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,940
to see as well the evolution of this

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,860
beautiful conference

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,440
um today's topic is a reflection of the

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,160
gloominess of the storm of crises that

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,920
we are facing on so many fronts the war

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,519
in Ukraine the energy crisis the cost of

67
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,280
living crisis the climate crisis but

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,739
also the the the the rise of the far

69
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,739
right so we wanted to explore today how

70
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,260
we think about technology in this

71
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,379
context is technology fostering

72
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,220
amplifying these crisis

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,260
should we rethink our relation to

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,659
internet and access to Internet as a

75
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,540
common good and these are some questions

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,580
that we hope this community can continue

77
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,760
to address together we hope

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,440
this community can continue to question

79
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,500
the power abuses the exploitation the

80
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,959
oppressions that are at the core of this

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,959
crisis and that's collectively we can

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,239
also Imagine in technology that works

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,480
for all and reclaim our rights our

84
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,360
democracy and our planet so I really

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,099
look forward to some very interesting

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,200
conversations whether

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,480
on the intersection of digital rights

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,659
and the climate crisis whether

89
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:54,200
rethinking internet platforms

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,580
surveillance technology and how it

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,220
impacts people on the move but also

92
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,840
police surveillance and thinking about

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,120
abolitionist Frameworks

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,739
um so I really hope you enjoy today's

95
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,360
content

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,299

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,099
needs throughout the day please contact

173
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,259
Guillermo Paris from the from the

174
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,639
edgware team

175
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,060
and that's it we're gonna start now and

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,880
run until approximately 11 where we have

177
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,099
the coffee break then there are another

178
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,380
there are other rounds of sessions for

179
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,300
about an hour and 20 minutes and then

180
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,699
lunch lunch will be in the foyer where

181
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,759
we you just had coffee

182
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,800
and after lunch we have two rounds of

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,020
sessions again and we will finish here

184
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,819
at five so I really hope you enjoyed

185
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,099

186
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,919
are online that you can really um

187
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,759
yeah listening and and and follow all of

188
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,620

191
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,840
talking

192
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,419
um so announcing that here just right

193
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,279
now will be the discussion on

194
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,500
Reinventing platforms

195
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,559
um that will be led by Valencia Pavel we

196
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
have the rise of Border Tech so Ai and

197
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,380
migration in the boudoir

198
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,000
and the workshop on europol in the salon

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,820
so we will have people introducing these

200
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,040
sessions in the respective rooms thank

201
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,899
you very much I hope you really enjoy

202
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,140
today

203
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,760
welcome to the session on rematching

204
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
platform ecosystem this session will be

205
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,140
a hybrid session and will be moderated

206
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,480
by Valentina Pavel she's a legal

207
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,519
researcher as at other Lovelace

208
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,260
Institute and I immediately give you the

209
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,500
floor

210
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,360
hello everyone

211
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,720
to see you here thanks for choosing this

212
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
session

213
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,580
um we're going to talk about

214
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,399
reimagining platform ecosystems

215
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,019
um

216
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,959
and um

217
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,600
I I have some little surprises in for

218
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,660
you today but let's uh let's get started

219
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,019
on some some context and housekeeping

220
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,959
and Logistics first

221
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,899
um

222
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,600
so uh I'm a legal researcher at the Ada

223
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,540
Lovelace Institute we are an independent

224
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,760
Research Institute based in London and

225
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,279
in Brussels and our mission is to ensure

226
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,200
that data and AI work for people in

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,500
society and in November we published a

228
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,260
report called rethinking data and

229
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,140
rebalancing digital power that looks at

230
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,000
four interventions across infrastructure

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,920
institutions governance and public

232
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,899
participation

233
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,899
that can help us uh

234
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,660
think more ambitiously about our digital

235
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,620
ecosystem and transform how platforms

236
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,720
work towards the needs of people and

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
Society instead of them serving

238
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,779
corporate agendas and one of these

239
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,920
interventions is interoperability as a

240
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,120
way to transform how platforms work

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,420
and

242
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,959
I today it's it's very good to open this

243
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,360
discussion together with you and our

244
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,000
panelists and think more critically

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,240
about what would a new vision for

246
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
platforms look like

247
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,980
um

248
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,800
and what would it mean for for online

249
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,500
platforms to work for us uh what would

250
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,279
we'd like to see when it comes to uh to

251
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,680
digital systems

252
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,540
um

253
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,959
and uh one of the ways we can think more

254
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,620
critically about this is to introduce

255
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,940
interoperability mandates

256
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,660
that can introduce a higher degree of

257
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,300
modularity and customization in

258
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,160
platforms for example replacing

259
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,180
different third-party algorithms

260
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,220
but we're going to develop more into

261
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,339
that in in a second

262
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:51,839
in terms of housekeeping as you know

263
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,300
this the session is being recorded and

264
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,440
streamed we have a hybrid panel and this

265
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,860
is my first hybrid panel so I'm counting

266
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,200
on your tolerance if there are technical

267
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,440
glitches and I want your support in case

268
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,779
things get um

269
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,360
sidetracked a little bit

270
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,200
um

271
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,120
so we have

272
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,459
um two of our speakers in the room two

273
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,880
of our speakers uh online but I know

274
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,579
there's also very great expertise in the

275
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,380
room and I'd like to invite your

276
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,839
questions and comments very early in the

277
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,839
discussion if you're on social media

278
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,860
please tweet with the hashtag

279
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,740
privacycam23 and hashtag rethinkingdata

280
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,220
and if you have questions please do use

281
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,380
these these hashtags

282
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,360
um

283
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,620
uh I'm gonna ask my colleague Connor but

284
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,740
maybe he's not yet in the room

285
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,959
to help me monitor social media but if

286
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,820
not I'll find another

287
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,959
uh another volunteer

288
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,899
um and I do have

289
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,920
one provocation for you we're in January

290
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,500
and January usually is the time when we

291
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,720
look forward when we make predictions

292
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,260
when you when we think about the future

293
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,040
so just as a way to warm up those

294
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,620
hashtags I'd like to invite you to type

295
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,800
in your predictions for 2023 in terms of

296
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,700
where do you see platforms this year

297
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,639
given given the fact that the dma and

298
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,459
the DSA are going to to come into

299
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:36,920
application

300
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,660
and where would you like them to be in

301
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,720
5-10 years from now what changes would

302
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,660
you like to see so as you're typing in

303
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,660
your answers I'm going to introduce our

304
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,899
panelists and then ask them to to also

305
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,980
share their predictions and their

306
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,600
wishes and hopes for for digital

307
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,880
platforms so

308
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,500
we have Ian Brown computer scientist and

309
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,260
internet regulation expert with us in

310
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,160
the room

311
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,440
we have Victorio Bertola ahead of policy

312
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,339
and Innovation and open at open xnet we

313
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,779
have Chantal yoris legal officer Article

314
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,519
19 and John Von trichner CEO and and

315
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,139
founder at Vivaldi and I'm extremely

316
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,380
grateful to have you all here especially

317
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,800
because some of you are

318
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,260
with a big time zone differences behind

319
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,540
of us so I'm really grateful to all of

320
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,660
you

321
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,420
um and just to up the games in terms of

322
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,699
using those hashtags and you posting on

323
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,639
social media preferably on Mastodon uh

324
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,860
you can tag me uh edry and Ada Lovelace

325
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,500
um on Mastodon

326
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,980
um you'll find us very easily uh or on

327
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,380
Twitter Twitter is still still a thing

328
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,019
unfortunately but we will accept we'll

329
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,720
accept and I have some

330
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,180
um

331
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,480
some little

332
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,040
incentives for you to do that those

333
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,120
tweets

334
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,800
so this this is an Ada Lovelace mug and

335
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,680
it says what would Ada say so what would

336
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
Ada say about platform regulation this

337
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,440
year and in five years from now and the

338
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,199
the three most interesting uh

339
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
predictions are going to to win three

340
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
mugs and I need a judge for that

341
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,079
does anybody want to volunteer to be a

342
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,220
judge and monitor Mastodon and Twitter

343
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,199
to offer these presents because I I

344
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,240
don't want to be a judge I did study law

345
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,860
but yeah

346
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,459
I'm more of an activist to be honest

347
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,040
I'm gonna volunteer you if if you're not

348
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,920
gonna raise your hand

349
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
and I'm gonna volunteer the the person

350
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,380
who has uh their phone ringing because

351
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,800
obviously obviously they are very well

352
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,920
connected to social media

353
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,620
you're going to decide who gets the the

354
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,440
three uh coffee mugs

355
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,620
okay so uh

356
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,899
please do type in your answers you have

357
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,339
until the end of the session to that

358
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,139
we'll announce the the winners at the

359
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,680
end and now uh Ian and

360
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,440
would you like to

361
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,420
share with us what's your what's your

362
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,839
vision for platform ecosystems where do

363
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,779
you think interoperability fits in and

364
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,899
what would be some of the advantages and

365
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,160
disadvantages that you see

366
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:59,480
with your with your sort of theme of

367
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,320
revolutionary change which I like

368
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,759
because I spend most of my time thinking

369
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,980
about incremental change

370
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,900
um I think we're already seeing a lot of

371
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,419
interesting incremental change and and

372
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,660
we'll hopefully get a lot more of it via

373
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,640
interoperability mandates in the dma

374
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,699
next year I mean it it comes into Force

375
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,500
I mean it's in force but it the The

376
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Gatekeepers will be designated uh in the

377
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,819
summer I think it's September the

378
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,619
commissioner has to do that by and then

379
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,380
those Gatekeepers will have to

380
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,900
um follow the obligations in the dma by

381
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,020
Next by next March March 2024 and then

382
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,000
there's an even further stage with the

383
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,860
interoperability obligation other

384
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,080
companies that want to connect to it

385
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
will almost certainly be WhatsApp and

386
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,620
iMessage and perhaps some of the other

387
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,780
big messaging platforms have to request

388
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,520
it and then The Gatekeepers have three

389
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,000
months so I hope later next year

390
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,100
a very concrete hope I can delete

391
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,679
WhatsApp finally I deleted Facebook

392
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
years and years ago and never regretted

393
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,940
that but of course one of the arguments

394
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
for an interoperability

395
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,960
um obligation is it's very hard if all

396
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,400
your friends and family and colleagues

397
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,679
and school kids teachers and Community

398
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,500
groups and so on have um lots of

399
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,480
discussions on one platform which really

400
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
you need to be on you know if you want

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,960
to have a social life if you want to

402
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,059
know when your kids school is closed

403
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,280
tomorrow because of snow a whole a whole

404
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
variety of reasons so that's my very

405
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,640
Concrete Hope

406
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,679
I hope we'll see a lot more innovation

407
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,559
in platform businesses generally and

408
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,380
again other bits of the dma have you

409
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,640
know it's not just the messaging

410
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
interoperability obligation which got

411
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,059
which got a lot of the media coverage

412
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,679
there's stuff relating to operating

413
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,900
systems app stores search engines and so

414
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,860
on

415
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,860
um and I hope that will make you know we

416
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,100
have examples like DuckDuckGo and and

417
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,620
Signal more privacy Focus platforms they

418
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,419
still have very they still have a very

419
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,419
small market share overall and I hope

420
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,059
the dma will help them to significantly

421
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,160
increase in quality and and user numbers

422
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,220
so that's the evolution on the on the

423
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,780
revolution side

424
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,820
um one thing I look I really liked in in

425
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,940
the report that Valentina and and

426
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,799
colleagues did with Ada last year was

427
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,039
platforms tend to be monolithic today

428
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,520
um sometimes they'll let you plug in

429
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,620
components ask Facebook and ask Twitter

430
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,140
do that serve the interests of those

431
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,059
platforms but of course there's always

432
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,860
the risk as we just saw with Twitter

433
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,380
last week I mean here's another quick

434
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,140
question Who was using tweetbot or

435
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,020
twitterific or one of the third party

436
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,000
um clients to read Twitter rather than

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,380
Twitter's own

438
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,960
uh platform and sadly we no longer are

439
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,780
because Elon Musk decided last week he

440
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,460
was no he was no longer going to allow

441
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,880
alternative Twitter clients to connect

442
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,500
um to connect to Twitter so we're all

443
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,600
thrown back onto the main

444
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,520
um Twitter platform

445
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,059
that's the risk of interoperability of

446
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,820
complementary Services if the platform

447
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,280
itself always gets to decide well which

448
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,320
of these services do I want to allow to

449
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,480
connect or not of course they're not

450
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,039
going to allow services to connect that

451
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,660
they think threaten their their business

452
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,460
that's what that's what musk has said

453
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,380
and that's where I think regulation is

454
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,220
important but imagine imagine platforms

455
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,020
which went much further than that which

456
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,240
technically speaking it would be more

457
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,860
complex but it would be possible that

458
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,559
you could decompose platforms into lots

459
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,539
of different bits of functionality and

460
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,700
plug in alternative

461
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,380
um stuff of your choice

462
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,960
um the one which Article 19 which I'll

463
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,520
leave Chantal to talk about has been

464
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
working on I think is a really

465
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,880
interesting idea of changing the

466
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,860
recommendation and curation algorithms

467
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,620
in social media platforms but you could

468
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,380
imagine all sorts of other ways to give

469
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,179
people a lot more choice about how

470
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,340
platforms worked

471
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,100
um to let to give opportunities to smes

472
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,440
to come up with new Innovative

473
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,900
functionality that are a big platform

474
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,020
might not think was so interesting so

475
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm I'm still as passionate about

476
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,460
interoperability as I was when I started

477
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,460
researching it in 2008 I've been I've

478
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,500
been pushing for it ever since and it's

479
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,360
wonderful it's in the dma and I hope it

480
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,700
will go a lot further

481
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,520
thank you thank you Ian Ian has a very

482
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,679
great contribution in our rethinking

483
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,660
data and rebalancing digital power

484
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,480
reports so I do recommend you you read

485
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,580
that because it it goes into the

486
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,380
Practical implementations of

487
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,679
interoperability mandates but Chantal I

488
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,880
also want to come to you

489
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,900
and ask you to share us your vision for

490
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,700
for platforms

491
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,500
um and yeah what are your your

492
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,440
predictions what's coming up next

493
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,419
thank you Valentina and good morning

494
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,220
everyone it's a pleasure to be with you

495
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,940
today

496
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,240
and so I I work for Article 19 and we're

497
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,400
an international freedom of expression

498
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,679
organization so that is basically the

499
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,260
lens through which review

500
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,940
um interoperability

501
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,320
um and and platforms more generally

502
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,600
um first of all I I do agree basically

503
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,640
with all the excellent points that were

504
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
made by Ian

505
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,740
and from a freedom of expression

506
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,299
perspective more specifically

507
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,940
um of course uh we we would wish the

508
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,820
internet was this open

509
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,460
um space for for debate exchange of

510
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,480
ideas uh where users can can connect and

511
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,700
and express themselves

512
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,440
um freely and and of course you

513
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,419
understand as well that today this is

514
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,340
this really is not the case

515
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,059
um it might seem unrestricted but a few

516
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,659
a handful of of dominant uh companies

517
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,240
and platforms really have a lot of power

518
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,520
over over the internet at the

519
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,320
infrastructure level but also when it

520
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,539
comes more specifically to like social

521
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,760
media companies and they have an

522
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,179
enormous amount of power over the the

523
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,299
information we get to access and the

524
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,299
ways we can we can express ourselves

525
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,240
and so our vision really is also we know

526
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,980
as well that the the business models

527
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,659
that have been adopted by many of the

528
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,820
dominant players are not exactly

529
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,700
conducive to a healthy debate uh the way

530
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,340
they recommended systems work and I will

531
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,039
I will talk about that aspect

532
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,700
um in a bit uh a bit later on but the

533
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,260
way these recommend their systems work

534
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,080
they tend to amplify the content that

535
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,200
tends to engage users more which leads

536
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,299
to dissemination and amplification of

537
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,360
harmful content of this information

538
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,039
etc etc

539
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,659
um so in that sense we think that

540
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,100
our vision is basically that the

541
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,539
internet goes back and these private

542
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,799
companies as you mentioned at the start

543
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,620
uh Valentina also that they work again

544
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,520
for users and enabling users

545
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,039
um to to again Express themselves and

546
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,860
participate in in public debate and we

547
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,080
think that the the solutions generally

548
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,820
that we've proposed to the article 19s

549
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,179
are are two one is of course the sort of

550
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,240
more traditional focus on human rights

551
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,280
due diligence

552
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,679
um transparency of platforms procedural

553
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,080
rights Etc which are more aspects that

554
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,120
we've talked about in the context of the

555
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,419
DSA the Digital Services act and then as

556
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,799
well we think

557
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,220
um that the that the companies which are

558
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,880
Gatekeepers also in the sense of our

559
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,820
enjoyment of human rights that their

560
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,100
their Market power needs to be needs to

561
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,440
be curved because otherwise there there

562
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,720
will not be enough incentive for new

563
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,120
players to come in and for users to make

564
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,640
a choice which service they want to use

565
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,159
without as Ian mentioned losing all

566
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,799
their all their contacts because for

567
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,820
instance they want to leave Facebook

568
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,820
because they think their respect for

569
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,580
privacy it doesn't live up to the

570
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,299
standards I today if I if I wanna if I

571
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,919
want to make a choice to leave Facebook

572
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,679
I lose all my context essentially right

573
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,659
so we do think it can bring in new

574
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,760
players that may have an incentive to

575
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,400
focus more on reputational risk around

576
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,100
human rights or how they respect the

577
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,840
right of privacy the right to freedom of

578
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,460
expression

579
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,580
um so also in terms of prediction we now

580
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,159
obviously have the the DSA

581
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,020
and the dma

582
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,320
um both of them we think are a step in

583
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
the right direction they might not have

584
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,419
been as ambitious in in certain way as

585
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,880
we would have wanted them to see but but

586
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,559
for sure the fact that the

587
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,720
interoperability now has become part of

588
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,400
the dma and that these human rights

589
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,860
considerations have become part of the

590
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,539
discussion of the competition discussion

591
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,059
and the discussions in the dma

592
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,799
um are positive

593
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,380
um also when it comes I mean we really

594
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,200
as a matter of principle or or generally

595
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
we we basically only see upsides from

596
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,080
introducing more and more

597
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,059
interoperability of course if this is

598
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,100
introduced it needs to come with

599
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,260
um with relevant protections to privacy

600
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,380
security etc etc but we don't see any

601
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,380
downside per se of making the platforms

602
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,080
as interoperable as possible

603
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,419
thank you thank you very much Chantal

604
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,559
that was excellent uh Jan can I can I

605
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,399
turn next to you

606
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,860
so

607
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,679
um I think where I'm coming from is a

608
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,220
little bit of a different place

609
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,200
I've been on the internet for a really

610
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,900
long time since 1992 building two

611
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,760
browser companies are now on my second

612
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,520
one and and I'm kind of pissed off about

613
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,400
the idea that

614
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,779
companies are getting away with

615
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,600
basically being spyware and collecting

616
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
information about what we are doing and

617
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,820
and in my humble opinion the first step

618
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,740
that we need to go to is to basically

619
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,360
ban this

620
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,659
um that this level of collection of data

621
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,820
shouldn't be allowed and I'm not saying

622
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,240
you can't use any data whatsoever but I

623
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,640
do think it's really important that we

624
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,340
we we stop this misuse of data the

625
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,980
profiling of users and the utilizing of

626
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,740
that profiling to to place content so

627
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,480
instead of giving people a choice of

628
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,299
algorithms to to show content I want to

629
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,179
to basically ban this way of selecting

630
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,720
content and in particular band The

631
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,179
profiling I think the damage to society

632
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,400
is significant and I don't really think

633
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,679
technically speaking there is a simple

634
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,919
way to do this uh I mean reading the

635
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,860
report there's a lot of details in your

636
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,720
report about all the things that need to

637
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,120
be done to deal with the fact that you

638
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,620
have data

639
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,900
uh in my humble opinion it's a lot

640
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,360
simpler to just take data out of the

641
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
equation

642
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,059
now that doesn't mean that I'm not

643
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,100
excited about kind of new ways of doing

644
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,840
things and I hope everyone will be

645
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,600
moving over to the more Open Standards

646
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,360
there's a new open standard with the

647
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,380
activity Pub uh which enables you to

648
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,559
write a new uh Technical Solutions to

649
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,440
which are distributed but just to be

650
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,840
clear Solutions like Mastodon and the

651
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,539
like that are built on top of that

652
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,460
they're not data is not part of the

653
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,340
equation there so the idea of forcing

654
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,039
data to be part of that equation I think

655
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,799
is is not a good thing you still have

656
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,279
the ability to move from one platform to

657
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,860
another and and I think that's a really

658
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,240
good thing and I think it's good that

659
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,039
that's being a focus that you are able

660
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,320
to move between platforms I'm just

661
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,620
afraid of cementing the the rights of

662
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,200
big Tech to be collecting our data and

663
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,299
that we just normalize it instead of

664
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,279
saying it's wrong that we say okay we

665
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,279
have to live with it and I I think

666
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,200
that's a very dangerous thing to do I

667
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,360
think we're seeing the consequences of

668
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,039
what they've been doing I think they

669
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,720
should never have been allowed to do

670
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,220
that in the first place I think they

671
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,740
should have had the ethics to stop doing

672
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,360
it as soon as they understood that what

673
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,940
they were doing was wrong and I think

674
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,919
obviously I think all of them realize

675
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,840
that

676
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,399
so we need to change there

677
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,159
um and I think fixing the kind of issues

678
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,320
that we have with with data collection

679
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,659
and privacy and the like it needs to be

680
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,880
done that way so so from the one side

681
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,380
basically Banning the use of of

682
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,260
profiling and data for the display of

683
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,440
data and ads and and the like and the

684
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,200
other hand I think anyone should be

685
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,179
embracing those new standards because

686
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,740
suddenly we actually have something

687
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,520
that's standardized uh which is uh where

688
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,580
we have a the w3c behind it so the

689
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,200
worldwide back control tune which is

690
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,140
kind of uh the guys that gave us the web

691
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,940
uh obviously starting with Tim

692
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,880
berners-lee uh that's what we should be

693
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,620
supporting that should we do and that's

694
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,320
by the way that we've we asked the first

695
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,720
browser company and and all this coming

696
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,539
after us uh I have jumped in and are

697
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,880
putting up our own servers and and again

698
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,000
trying to explain how this all of this

699
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,940
works all the institutions companies

700
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,080
foundations and the like should be

701
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,700
putting up their own servers and

702
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,380
engaging in that and I think there's an

703
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,779
opportunity now in particular with the

704
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,940
focus of the misuse and focus of what's

705
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,919
happening on Twitter for this to take

706
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,419
off and I think we all should be

707
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,980
supporting that and that's actually

708
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,960
maybe one of the faster ways to see a

709
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,140
change

710
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,080
thank you thank you very much for uh for

711
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,120
bringing those concerns in and uh

712
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,059
Vittorio let us know if there's any way

713
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,760
we can address some of the points that

714
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,980
that Jan mentioned and if

715
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,520
interoperability does uh does help or

716
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,620
does more harm with that

717
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,860
yeah no of course interability helps so

718
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,779
I mean I'll start from the question of

719
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,220
what are the platforms going to do

720
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,559
tomorrow and I think they're going to do

721
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,760
the same thing that they've been trying

722
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,799
to do every day so they conquer the

723
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,899
world so it is really a mission for

724
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,279
Conquering the entire knowledge of the

725
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,200
world and closing it down and using it

726
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
to build multiple Gardens and so this is

727
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
the stake I will I mean many people

728
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,620
especially outside of Technology do not

729
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,779
really understand what's at stake so now

730
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,760
this is endangering really the Democracy

731
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,640
in the basics of our of our society and

732
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,320
and so they're going to build more World

733
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,480
Gardens and titles just opening up these

734
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,980
ones they will resist implementation of

735
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,440
the dma they will resist the additional

736
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,240
load so we'll send law boosts everywhere

737
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,520
to all the capitals and all the offices

738
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,640
here and they they will try to basically

739
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,799
make all this talk of digital

740
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,039
sovereignty Sovereign Cloud Mood by just

741
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,440
giving very good offers to all public

742
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
administrations in Europe so that they

743
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,220
use Office 365 or Google Suite or

744
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,980
whatever so did they have that things

745
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,679
that that are both based on in on the

746
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,179
legal side but also on the business side

747
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,039
and also on the technical side usually

748
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,779
they try to use their Global

749
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,299
standardization uh bodies to to push

750
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,760
certain technologies that suit their way

751
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,440
and I have a word of caution about

752
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,539
encryption which is good and we all like

753
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,340
it and we've been pushing for it but now

754
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,659
they are trying to build this kind of

755
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,520
encrypted overlay Network so that you

756
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,260
have a phone on you or something you're

757
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,299
a vocal assistant in your home and this

758
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,039
just opens up an encrypted channel to a

759
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,539
server in the US and escapes and

760
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,520
European law and any control you don't

761
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,440
even know which data are being sent from

762
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,240
your home to the servers and somewhere

763
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,860
in the cloud so they're actually they

764
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,539
are using encryption to disempower the

765
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,980
users so then so in the end the the

766
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,659
point is rather

767
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,520
interoperability is important because it

768
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,899
is one of the key elements of any

769
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,899
alternative that we want to build into a

770
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,120
post this actually it was the original

771
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,100
principle of the intern so if you if you

772
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,380
look at how the intent was designed in

773
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,120
in the last century now I mean until the

774
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,340
end of the 20th century it was based on

775
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,080
interoperability and the services that

776
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,059
came out of that phase like email or the

777
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,820
web were interoperable services and we

778
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,919
actually are still today the the I mean

779
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,419
in a way even if they are trying to be

780
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,460
dominated by the issuance aspects they

781
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,559
are still the most open ones the ones in

782
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,760
which you can actually choose different

783
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,679
providers and you can actually use third

784
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,200
party applications to send messages or

785
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,299
connect to web pages all over the world

786
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,039
without having to go through the

787
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,059
platform and so we are not really trying

788
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,320
to propose anything new with

789
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,299
interoperability it's really being just

790
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,980
keeping the promise of the internet

791
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,440
which was that even if you were not in

792
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,000
California not in Europe not in China

793
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,740
but in I mean somewhere in Latin America

794
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,340
or or in Africa or in Vietnam I mean you

795
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,019
could just download the specifications

796
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,600
and learn how to write the code and

797
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,159
build something that would work all over

798
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,539
the internet without having to ask for

799
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:56,340
permission to anyone to any government

800
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,320
but also to any company

801
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,019
so the sad thing that I mean that we are

802
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:03,000
now in the middle of is that we

803
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,860
discovered that I mean we defended the

804
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,539
global borderless and regulated nature

805
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,399
of the internet from governmental

806
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,199
intervention and then we discovered that

807
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,820
if you go too far in that direction

808
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,040
there are no laws and there will be a

809
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,418
few private companies will just take

810
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,399
over the internet and close it down so

811
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,719
we don't want the governments to close

812
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,280
down the internet but we also don't want

813
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,320
big global companies to close down the

814
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,699
internet we have to find the good middle

815
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,679
ground and I think this will be the

816
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,139
discussion from the next few years where

817
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,580
do you set this Middle Ground so that

818
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,040
you have some lows some regulation but

819
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,199
not too much that that goes in the

820
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,000
opposite direction

821
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,239
uh thank you thank you Victoria uh so

822
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,339
you heard

823
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:45,119
um a range of perspectives uh so I I

824
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,280
want to

825
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,080
incentivize you bringing in the the

826
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,260
first question to the panelist with uh

827
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,379
giving you an ADA sticker so whoever

828
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,660
raises their their hand first are going

829
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,240
to to receive stickers

830
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,859
um

831
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:05,339
and if you're not ready for that yet I

832
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,619
do have a set of questions for all our

833
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,720
panelists

834
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,440
um for for Yan um for Ian in if if we

835
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,220
think from a competition perspective

836
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,420
um

837
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,140
how can we

838
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,660
enable this new type of uh of

839
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,240
infrastructure wind interoperability and

840
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,960
and change and rebalance market dynamics

841
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,119
uh what would this mean for for users

842
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,579
what would how would it look like in in

843
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,040
its most desirable form

844
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,920
and I also want to you to touch on this

845
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,480
point about

846
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,700
um something that was mentioned in the

847
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,859
European data protection supervisor's

848
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,640
opinion uh which said that

849
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
um the the provisions on

850
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,800
interpretability in the digital markets

851
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,099
act are actually have the potential to

852
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,320
advance gdpr goals and we've also heard

853
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,599
Yeon being less optimistic about privacy

854
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,480
and data protection so how do we put

855
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,980
everything in balance and how do we

856
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,320
negotiate this

857
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,040
in terms of what legal Provisions legal

858
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,960
obligations for interoperability look

859
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,460
like we've we've got a number of

860
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,040
examples concrete examples now we have

861
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,320
the we have the dma in its final form

862
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,079
there was a lot of negotiation

863
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,480
um that led to the exact language about

864
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,579
messaging interoperability obligations

865
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,740
it's a real shame that the European

866
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,020
parliament's version of the dma which

867
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,380
also had a social media

868
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,119
interoperability obligation didn't get

869
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,400
past the European Council so that's not

870
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,099
in the final version but I I think I I

871
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,599
think there are still ways over time

872
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,280
that might be addressed but there's

873
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,859
legislation in the U.S Congress that

874
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,740
would impose very similar obligations if

875
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,880
you want to look it up it's called the

876
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,680
access act

877
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,400
um it it didn't obviously did not pass

878
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,040
yet whether the Democrat now that the

879
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,839
Republicans are in charge of the House

880
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,940
of Representatives I imagine there won't

881
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,560
be a lot of change for the next couple

882
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,420
of years but we will we will see after

883
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,060
that actually China has done a lot on

884
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,160
interoperability obligations you you'll

885
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,800
I'm sure you're aware that uh you know

886
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,780
we have Gaff we have gatham dominating

887
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,540
the world largely outside China in

888
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,220
inside China there are Chinese

889
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,800
equivalents massive platforms that don't

890
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,380
even even more to an extent than gafam

891
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,480
do elsewhere

892
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,579
um like Alibaba and tencent and the

893
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,020
Chinese government is

894
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,579
um first of all put pressure on those

895
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,400
companies to open up their services to

896
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,579
to a larger degree than they had before

897
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:46,020
but China is also changing its

898
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,480
anti-monopoly law and putting new

899
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,280
um consumer protection Provisions in

900
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,920
place to require interoperability so in

901
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,480
terms of you know what does the law look

902
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,640
like to require interoperability we've

903
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,440
we've got a we've got a number of

904
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,480
examples

905
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,760
in terms of what the European data

906
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,220
protection supervisors opinion has said

907
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,900
I mean that's always been one of my

908
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,140
motivations as well in in advocating for

909
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,079
interoperability obligations because the

910
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,180
hope is that

911
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,579
um and by the way just to make clear I'm

912
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,280
not saying this can replace the gdpr and

913
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,079
strong privacy laws

914
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,359
it can complementate complement it I

915
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:27,180
think if you give people more choice and

916
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,460
people care about privacy which as we

917
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,700
know from lots of surveys over the years

918
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,320
many people do

919
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,160
um

920
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,079
if you give them the ability to pick

921
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,839
signal not what's up to pick DuckDuckGo

922
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,900
not Google you know privacy focused uh

923
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,880
Services freedom of expression focused

924
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,099
Services as Chantelle was talking about

925
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,480
that's one way to um Advance rights I'm

926
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm personally not excited by

927
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,020
interoperability because of you know

928
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,359
commercial factors it's it's always been

929
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,280
that that um that I've found most

930
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,320
interesting and that is what the Ed the

931
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,740
edps said in their opinion um I agree

932
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,500
with it there was some criticism last

933
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,859
year when the when the EU institutions

934
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,079
announced they had reached political

935
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,060
agreement on the dma including

936
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,040
interoperability

937
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,619
um they weren't clear about exactly what

938
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,240
they meant which I think was a mistake

939
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,440
because then there was a lot of

940
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,140
speculation online about exactly what

941
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,940
does this mean and actually will it

942
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,980
damage privacy and security

943
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,780
I don't think it does I think the dma

944
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,820
has got it right in the way it sets out

945
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,920
data very detailed Provisions in article

946
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,460
7 on those on those aspects but I think

947
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,320
that this is something I've heard

948
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,820
Victoria talk about as well and very

949
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,560
much agree with you

950
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,079
yes keep thinking about the impacts of

951
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,599
on privacy of data flowing between

952
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,480
organizations with explicit user consent

953
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,839
but also keep in mind this other Factor

954
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,880
well if you're giving people more

955
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,859
genuine Choice over the services they

956
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,079
use that means you're enabling people

957
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,839
that value privacy to actually switch

958
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,460
service and hopefully generate more

959
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,339
Market pressure alongside strong gdpr

960
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,760
enforcement and to do that

961
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,060
thank you and Chantal I'm gonna turn to

962
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,320
you first

963
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,160
um

964
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,920
if we go beyond the digital markets act

965
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,200
and we think about interoperability

966
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,440
measures that would allow us for example

967
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,960
to replace uh different core

968
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,900
functionalities like news feeds content

969
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,000
moderation

970
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,820
um what what would be the implications

971
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,520
from a freedom of uh expression point of

972
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,099
view because on the one hand side we can

973
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,460
say that this offers more more choice

974
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,339
and it's uh it's better for for the

975
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:49,740
individual user but at the same time we

976
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,040
also have concerns when it comes to

977
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,440
entrenching the the position of of large

978
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,740
platforms is in the indispensable

979
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,300
infrastructure so

980
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,820
um

981
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,980
where do we where do we situate this uh

982
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,880
from your point of view

983
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,140
yes um

984
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,880
um so first of all I need to give a

985
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,820
quick shout out to my colleague Issa who

986
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,339
is the the competition expert in our

987
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,020
team and has been working a lot on this

988
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,320
on our policy on interoperability

989
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,420
um when it comes to these core

990
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,079
functionalities of of the platforms

991
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,780
um so yeah so for Article 19 we have

992
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,760
been pushing as part of again our

993
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,920
freedom of expression advocacy generally

994
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,079
and and on our work on platform

995
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,760
regulation

996
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,280
um that that these core functionalities

997
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,560
should be opened up so um we

998
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,119
categorically think that this will be

999
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,900
positive uh for freedom of expression

1000
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,119
um so because the vast majority as we

1001
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,740
have it now obviously the social media

1002
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,900
platforms that provide the hosting

1003
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,839
Services also in the same bundle provide

1004
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,720
decoration Services as well as the

1005
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,520
content moderation everything is done by

1006
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,680
the same player generally

1007
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,980
um and we do believe that if dominant

1008
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,280
platforms would have to allow for third

1009
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,099
parties to come in and for instance to

1010
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,700
provide alternative content creation to

1011
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,900
users

1012
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,720
um then these users could have obviously

1013
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,540
again a more active choice in what sort

1014
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,420
of content they access and in that sense

1015
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,220
a much more active

1016
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,859
um exercise of their right information

1017
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,680
right and we do think it will be

1018
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,900
beneficial from a freedom of expression

1019
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,320
perspective in in many ways so

1020
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,560
um I think if we give true I agree with

1021
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,599
yarn on that point if we give users the

1022
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,180
choice to and and level the playing

1023
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,700
field a little bit between the users and

1024
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,260
the companies because the users can

1025
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,640
leave if they don't like what the

1026
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,440
companies have to offer we can

1027
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,680
incentivize these private players to go

1028
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,660
in directions that Regulators basically

1029
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,460
have failed to do so for instance when

1030
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,180
it comes to the the collection of the of

1031
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,460
uh vast amount of personal data the

1032
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,920
profiling and and other harmful

1033
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,119
practices so where Regulators have have

1034
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,480
not managed to impose certain conditions

1035
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,980
that will be more beneficial for human

1036
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,560
rights we think that perhaps through

1037
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,079
more user choice and and through more

1038
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,780
empowerment of users that can be forced

1039
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,079
in different ways uh upon companies

1040
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,020
um so on on the one hand

1041
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,579
um we've talked a lot about how

1042
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,220
recommended systems again can have uh

1043
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,260
harmful effects how they are designed

1044
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,599
many times harmful effects on the public

1045
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,859
debate if users are given a choice and

1046
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:50,099
if different companies have to compete

1047
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,319
to be able to provide these creation

1048
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,180
services to users then it will

1049
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,560
incentivize them to provide better

1050
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,720
quality right and better quality can

1051
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,660
also mean again better respect for human

1052
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,260
rights less privacy invasive

1053
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,579
ways um of of collecting data profiling

1054
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,599
users and and for instance access to by

1055
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,460
the variety of sources these are all

1056
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,940
things that we know that many users wish

1057
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,500
to have but they don't really have

1058
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,160
viable Alternatives uh at the minute

1059
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,140
um at the same time we think it can be

1060
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,720
so we see obviously around the world

1061
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,560
many governments want see a problem with

1062
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,800
the dominance of certain companies and

1063
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,859
how they can promote and amplify harmful

1064
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:42,000
content but their remedy has been to

1065
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,040
regulated them in a manner that

1066
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,400
restricts user speech and in fact gives

1067
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,859
them more control to check what users

1068
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,020
should say or should not say online so

1069
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,359
we are categorically against such

1070
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,480
repressive regulatory Solutions and we

1071
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,720
do think that regulatory solution based

1072
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,880
more on interoperability open markets

1073
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,440
etc etc can provide maybe an alternative

1074
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,119
to more repressive answers that we've

1075
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,000
seen from government hopefully basically

1076
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,839
keep have governments opt for these type

1077
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,780
of measures if they work and refrain

1078
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,180
from adopting more repressive answers to

1079
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,940
to the same problem basically

1080
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,480
um and and so we think that this can

1081
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,460
work for Content creation services for

1082
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,319
Content moderation Services as well

1083
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,000
certain people might have different

1084
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,819
levels of Tolerance and which is uh fair

1085
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,060
enough uh and so they they might want to

1086
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,980
have a choice of what sort of content

1087
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,880
they get exposed to without that being

1088
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,940
imposed on all users in the same way so

1089
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,500
again we do think

1090
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,040
um diversifying the environment and also

1091
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,240
there are many ways if we have new

1092
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,619
players coming in there are also many

1093
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:01,319
ways these will be Innovative new actors

1094
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,079
which maybe we can't imagine right now

1095
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,359
as well so we think there's just like a

1096
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,880
whole host of possibilities of how we

1097
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,980
will be able to interact

1098
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,800
um online engage online uh participate

1099
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,560
in in public discussions Etc so we

1100
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,660
really think that

1101
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,060
um that that this will be fully positive

1102
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,520
as I mentioned at the start and to the

1103
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,400
point where you said that it might

1104
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,800
further console it day power because

1105
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,280
they will be seen certain companies were

1106
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,020
seen as less providing the necessary

1107
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,000
infrastructures for new players to come

1108
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,700
in I mean the way it is now they they

1109
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,960
don't provide only the necessary

1110
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,119
infrastructure they are the only uh

1111
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,060
alternative without any other option of

1112
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,440
any other player to use this

1113
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,440
infrastructure and their user base to

1114
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,640
provide

1115
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,140
um a different recommended system

1116
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,880
different content moderation tools so

1117
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,000
you know the the more we can also

1118
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,680
diversify on the infrastructure level

1119
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,480
and maybe some player will come in that

1120
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,240
that will become even more powerful

1121
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,700
outside the pure content creation

1122
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,180
service the better but we do think um it

1123
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,740
will not consolidate further the power

1124
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,660
of the dominant platforms it will it

1125
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,940
will definitely be a first step in the

1126
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,300
right direction

1127
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,359
thank you Chantal uh Jan if I can turn

1128
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:22,500
to you

1129
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,260
um and ask you to maybe reflect on some

1130
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,760
of the points that that were mentioned

1131
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,020
by by Chantal and and others and ask you

1132
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,260
um how do you see interoperability

1133
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,180
potentially being exploited by large

1134
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,839
platforms and

1135
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,099
what measures do we need to think about

1136
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:43,680
in order to avoid further dependencies

1137
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,260
on big Tech and I I did hear your your

1138
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,599
point loud and clear on

1139
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,780
um Banning attack and looking at the

1140
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,540
data level and trying to to figure out

1141
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,599
measures for data collection but um it'd

1142
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,839
be great to to hear your reflections

1143
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,119
yeah I think there's a number of points

1144
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,480
here and I think I mean for me it's

1145
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,339
obviously the elephant in the room is

1146
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,740
that the dealing with data and I and I

1147
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,800
think in a way uh we need to address

1148
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,960
that and that needs to be according and

1149
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,180
I think everything else becomes a lot

1150
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,940
easier in other ways but even when you

1151
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,500
have open systems you still have

1152
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,180
problems and I can tell you about that

1153
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,040
anyone that's for example trying to

1154
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,740
provide an email service

1155
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,720
um and we provide free email to our

1156
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,480
users as an example you'll run into

1157
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,339
systems where the big players will

1158
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:36,900
actually block you now they will block

1159
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,240
you for a reason because you're actually

1160
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,920
having

1161
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,740
um issues with uh with spammers and the

1162
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,020
likes of spammers try to utilize the

1163
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,119
different platforms but in the case of

1164
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,980
the big platforms they'll just block the

1165
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,020
block you fully right so there's an

1166
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,060
interoperability thing but then there's

1167
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,920
they have a reason to block you because

1168
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,440
there are spammers on your platform so

1169
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,480
they block the whole platform that you

1170
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,760
have instead of locking

1171
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,180
um just the spammers so there's things

1172
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,480
like that now when it comes to consent

1173
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,700
uh there's a lot of talk kind of that

1174
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,680
this is just a question of individual

1175
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,079
kind of decisions on what people want to

1176
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,420
do but the reality we know that and

1177
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,520
we've seen that before that content

1178
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,940
doesn't work uh basically people are not

1179
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,520
really actively given choice they don't

1180
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,280
understand obviously kind of what

1181
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,319
they're consenting too but also there's

1182
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,420
just a question to me what kind of

1183
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,180
things are you supposed to be allowed to

1184
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,880
ask people for and I just think that

1185
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,220
it's gone quite too far and we've seen

1186
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,040
that with gdpr and the like I mean where

1187
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,040
we are seeing the pop-ups asking can we

1188
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,500
utilize your data and there's a huge

1189
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,300
difference between how the data might be

1190
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,940
used but the dialogues may be very

1191
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,920
similar so there's there's a problem

1192
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,359
there I just don't think that it works

1193
00:50:00,359 --> 00:50:01,440
um

1194
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,460
to to be asking users those questions at

1195
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,460
all uh I think

1196
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,980
in reality they find ways to get around

1197
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,980
making it a real question and I also

1198
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,480
just think that people don't necessarily

1199
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,220
have the knowledge to understand what

1200
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,140
they're being asked and they think about

1201
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,700
it from a personal point of view and

1202
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,079
they think hey I don't really have too

1203
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,900
much to to hide and then they accept

1204
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,240
Okay to get access to the platform I'll

1205
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,420
just do uh exactly so I I think we need

1206
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,480
to change that now as I said I'm very

1207
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,660
excited about the uh the new Technical

1208
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,760
Solutions like with the activity Pub and

1209
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,859
the Macedon and the like and I would

1210
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:43,200
urge everyone to get on onto those

1211
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,240
platforms because I think that can

1212
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,300
provide a catalyst for change and I

1213
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,780
think obviously um the dma and and the

1214
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,460
digital Service Act and the like all of

1215
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,859
those can help with competition and I

1216
00:50:55,859 --> 00:50:58,500
think that's a that's a positive thing I

1217
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,780
mean I'm seeing the digital markets act

1218
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,400
as something that can make a significant

1219
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,740
difference but we just have to remember

1220
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,240
uh the big guys have a lot of different

1221
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,720
ways to create issues they can create

1222
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,000
incompatibilities and again I mean given

1223
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,740
that I've been doing this for a really

1224
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,960
long time I can probably describe a

1225
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,240
hundred different ways that they've made

1226
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,180
to to get around issues where they block

1227
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,579
a competition in one different way or

1228
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,980
another so again there's the concern

1229
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,780
there even if you're okay you can choose

1230
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,640
your own algorithm but you end up using

1231
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,099
the default one it's kind of like any of

1232
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,559
you noticed with the Microsoft I mean

1233
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,960
don't maybe it's getting there fully but

1234
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,000
kind of if you try to download the

1235
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,740
different browsers into the Windows

1236
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,140
operating system how many different ways

1237
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,900
do they try to persuade you not to do

1238
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,420
that or block it or you can just do it

1239
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,520
like apple does and not allow it in the

1240
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,319
first place or with Windows 10 ads and

1241
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,599
you don't allow it either so there's a

1242
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,180
lot of different ways to get around any

1243
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,280
kind of interoperability or Choice

1244
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,700
mechanisms which is why for simplicity's

1245
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,920
sake and not to have a situation where

1246
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,400
we put regulation in place and then kind

1247
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,900
of it doesn't really work and then we

1248
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,700
need to do it again and again and at the

1249
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,940
same time potentially cementing uh the

1250
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,680
position of the big guys because we're

1251
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,480
seeing that okay they're they're in the

1252
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,859
position they are so we can't do

1253
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:23,160
anything about it so we we kind of end

1254
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,960
up doing things around the edges I think

1255
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,359
we have to go a lot further uh and

1256
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,920
actually and a lot shorter in some ways

1257
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,359
because it's a lot simpler what I'm

1258
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,000
proposing which is kind of coming from

1259
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,740
the computer world it's the kiss keep it

1260
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,839
simple uh and and I think that's

1261
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:38,880
basically what we need we need to see

1262
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,619
that there is a

1263
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,260
clear regulation what we can do I I

1264
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,780
think the interoperability aspects that

1265
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,220
we are seeing with Technical Solutions

1266
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,020
like Mastodon and the like is very

1267
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,180
exciting because you can switch between

1268
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,480
servers and the like but I I also think

1269
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,880
it's it's not enough in itself you also

1270
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,740
need to deal with the elephant in the

1271
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,420
room which is the data collection and I

1272
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,819
don't think we should mandate kind of

1273
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:05,520
data collection and and kind of more

1274
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,200
people have access to it because I don't

1275
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,359
really think that will solve solution we

1276
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,280
need to deal with those things

1277
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,500
separately if we if we deal with the

1278
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,260
data collection ban it the misuse of

1279
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,420
data and at the same time we look at

1280
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,119
ways to to to be able to switch services

1281
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,740
and like I think then we are talking

1282
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,419
about solutions that will work

1283
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,700
uh thank you but I I do have a follow-up

1284
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,099
question for both uh

1285
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,260
you and Vittorio and basically everybody

1286
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,140
that's technical in the room

1287
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,800
um

1288
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,440
if we operate with Open Standards

1289
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,220
doesn't that mean that when a new player

1290
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,460
introduces Open Standards uh that

1291
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,339
potentially perform better than

1292
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:52,099
you know existing

1293
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:56,819
uh better than how current services are

1294
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:59,280
are running doesn't that create a sort

1295
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,160
of a race to the top in terms of

1296
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,579
new Services replacing the old and bad

1297
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,520
ones and users actually moving towards

1298
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,220
those Services

1299
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:13,859
is this uh is this happening Victoria is

1300
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,839
this a myth or

1301
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,079
well in general the the creation of new

1302
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:20,339
standards takes quite some time I mean

1303
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:22,079
the technology around the standards and

1304
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,119
the protocols changes relatively slowly

1305
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,000
what happens is that they evolve and so

1306
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,740
this is why the interoperability Clauses

1307
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,359
are designed so that you have a common

1308
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,099
layer of common functionalities and then

1309
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,900
you have ways to extend them which could

1310
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,420
actually be be unilateral by the

1311
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,760
specific services that and this could

1312
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,859
actually create this rise to the top and

1313
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:43,200
in general what you do I mean by

1314
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,240
mandating people to talk to each other

1315
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,800
is that you actually create competitions

1316
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,599
so I mean I'm clearly business guy

1317
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,520
because I have a jacket but you know I'm

1318
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,700
actually an engineer and my employer

1319
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,559
actually is an open source software

1320
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,359
maker we make some of the applications

1321
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,400
for email Indian DNS that are in any

1322
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,880
Linux distribution so so and I'm making

1323
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,099
this point because I do want to stress

1324
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,500
that that this this all this talk is not

1325
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,900
against businesses is not destroying the

1326
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,059
economy you know I was two months ago in

1327
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,980
a conference in Berlin organized by the

1328
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,300
other Network Foundation and there were

1329
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,400
politics editions by a certain German

1330
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,740
party saying that gdpr is the worst

1331
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,880
thing that ever happened to Europe

1332
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,920
because it's stifling business and it's

1333
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,380
okay and I raise my hand I said it's the

1334
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,720
exact opposite I mean for the European

1335
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,880
internet industry today if there is one

1336
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,440
competitive advantage against the

1337
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,420
Americans it's the gdpr it's the fact

1338
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,980
that you can tell the people that if you

1339
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,540
store your data in Europe and you use

1340
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,220
your services they will definitely be

1341
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,380
more private and less privacy including

1342
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,579
that in the American all the Chinese

1343
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:44,760
ones and so they'll I mean they and so

1344
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,260
this is why I think that this is a step

1345
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,240
forward even for for businesses because

1346
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,099
today if you want to create let's say

1347
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,020
let's talk about instant messaging since

1348
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,760
this is where the vulnerability is first

1349
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,579
coming into deployment so if you if

1350
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:58,559
today you want to create a new instant

1351
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,500
messaging app uh well good luck I mean

1352
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,000
yes you can create it maybe it's much

1353
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,220
better than WhatsApp and whatever but no

1354
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,540
one will use it because we already have

1355
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,980
like 10 different things that messaging

1356
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,420
apps and we don't want to install the

1357
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,520
11th and even if you do install the 11

1358
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,680
so you you as the maker convince people

1359
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,540
to install the 11th then there's no one

1360
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,520
they can talk with because all the users

1361
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,160
on the other side so if you change these

1362
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,720
so that all the apps can talk to each

1363
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,800
other at least for the basic

1364
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,720
functionalities what happens is that I

1365
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,579
mean the user can actually install this

1366
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:28,440
new app and immediately use it to talk

1367
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,660
with all their previous friends and

1368
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,180
contacts it's not that there's actually

1369
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,460
some useful this app and if the app is

1370
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,740
better actually can start gaining market

1371
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,500
shares and and we can use them maybe all

1372
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,640
the others will see you that you're

1373
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,500
using it and they will move to that app

1374
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,240
as well so this is creating

1375
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,099
opportunities for competition and for

1376
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,140
business but at the same time it's also

1377
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,880
giving users a choice and this is very

1378
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,339
important so if if the user is

1379
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,319
dissatisfied with WhatsApp they can

1380
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:56,940
actually move to something else without

1381
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,380
losing all their contacts and

1382
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,300
conversations and whatever you know that

1383
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,359
there was a study when when a couple of

1384
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,940
years ago sorry WhatsApp changed their

1385
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,680
terms and conditions there were people

1386
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,240
that really wanted to stop using

1387
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,920
Whatsapp because they were I mean the

1388
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,839
new conditions were worse and the the

1389
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:15,359
service said that over 100 people that

1390
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,520
tried only one percent in the end

1391
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,740
managed to completely move away from

1392
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,319
WhatsApp and distance and install it I

1393
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,480
mean some I mean like one-fourth I

1394
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,740
actually installed the new apps but

1395
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,359
still kept WhatsApp for the old

1396
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,160
conversations and most people just gave

1397
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,140
up and didn't change even if they really

1398
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,420
did not want to use WhatsApp anymore so

1399
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,280
this is actually the effect we also

1400
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,540
giving for you and there's more of that

1401
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,460
I mean why do we have to have 10

1402
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,960
applications that do the same thing I

1403
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,400
mean the only difference is usually the

1404
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,800
the color of the buttons I mean this is

1405
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,900
consuming resources it does have an

1406
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,760
environmental impact on I mean through

1407
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,220
consuming your battery and whatever I

1408
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,559
mean we don't need to to I mean to waste

1409
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,359
the resources to to have bigger phones

1410
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,859
and because you need to keep them

1411
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,599
messaging apps that's operating at the

1412
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,460
same time then I don't know if I mean we

1413
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,040
should discuss about the the myths that

1414
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,599
the big Tech expansion is pushing that

1415
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,700
this is going to to be against privacy

1416
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,859
and security because I mean you have

1417
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,200
this very secure WhatsApp application

1418
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,059
that is not letting your data be

1419
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,700
accessed by anyone except

1420
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,119
meta but uh so if you bring other other

1421
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,619
applications in the loop there will be

1422
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:21,480
other companies that can spy upon you

1423
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,940
and I mean this is really not true I

1424
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,859
mean it's like like for email if you

1425
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,960
don't don't trust the applications the

1426
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,520
system that the other person you want to

1427
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,020
talk with is using just don't send

1428
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,260
Communications and in the the railway in

1429
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,240
but in the end all the standards today

1430
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,339
are made so that way I mean what happens

1431
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:40,200
with browsers you have browsers you have

1432
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,180
web servers and they negotiate the good

1433
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,559
level of encryption the best level of

1434
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,420
encryption that they can give you and

1435
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,099
this is automatically and then that you

1436
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,359
don't have to do anything and it doesn't

1437
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,680
mean that all the traffic is not

1438
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,140
encrypted so that there are solutions of

1439
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,700
all these as well

1440
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,299
but just to complement uh just

1441
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:00,059
compliment the the question earlier if

1442
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:02,280
we look today at instant messaging apps

1443
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,559
they all run on the same encryption

1444
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,520
protocol right so signal signal came in

1445
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,260
at what point with the signal protocol

1446
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,440
and then everybody adopted it it was a

1447
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,020
pressure uh from the user side for them

1448
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,359
to adopt the protocol correct yeah I

1449
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,880
mean the signal is a sort of ambiguous

1450
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,559
position interpreter on interoperability

1451
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,480
but I understand them because they say

1452
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,000
yes we're in principle we agree we would

1453
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,559
like to interpolate but at the same time

1454
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,660
we are worried that if we interoperate

1455
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,280
with other apps that are not as secure

1456
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,040
as we are then our users might lose some

1457
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,740
security but the pro the point is that

1458
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,480
if you establish a standard for privacy

1459
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,980
and security you have to meet to connect

1460
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,140
then everybody will get at least that

1461
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,960
minimum level so I mean you can you can

1462
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,020
be ensured that that will happen and so

1463
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,880
of course it's there are also you know

1464
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,339
commercial positioning and Market

1465
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,260
positioning by all the various apps so

1466
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,359
if you have built all your credibility

1467
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,579
on saying I mean correctly we are more

1468
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,020
secure and private than all the other

1469
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,720
apps I mean then you cannot admit that

1470
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,520
all the other apps will be using your

1471
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,619
same encryption as well but at the same

1472
01:00:07,619 --> 01:00:10,859
time I think it's in the end for users

1473
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,359
it's an advantage to be able to choose

1474
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:13,559
because they will I mean if someone

1475
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:14,940
comes up with something better you will

1476
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,040
just be able to switch finally to

1477
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,720
something that is more virusable into

1478
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,640
you even if just maybe because they have

1479
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,619
the servers in in your country and not

1480
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,299
somewhere in the world in other places

1481
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,319
which have less privacy protection

1482
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:31,079
thanks Victoria oh yeah great great I

1483
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,079
can I can share stickers now

1484
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,920
yay who was who was first sorry I I I

1485
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,599

1486
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,440

uh we have a mic here so let me let me

1488
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:52,220
let me pass this forward

1489
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,880
yeah okay

1490
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,319
um I was wondering

1491
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:20,760
um the part you mentioned about there

1492
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,880
being like a lot of different apps a

1493
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,520
result of that is for example

1494
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,180
um apps like if this then that

1495
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,599
um that connect different apps and they

1496
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,299
more like sort of arose from the idea of

1497
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:38,960
just being annoyed that um

1498
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,000
uh sharing data between apps is

1499
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,700
difficult but not really the idea of

1500
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,640
privacy

1501
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,119
and a lot of people look at uh

1502
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,819
the the operating system to fulfill that

1503
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:57,960
uh purpose like why does if this than

1504
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,240
that exist if Apple could

1505
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,940
you know connect those apps in the

1506
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,020
OS and I'm wondering how much of the

1507
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,640
discussion or the problem should be

1508
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,900
solved by the operating system of

1509
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,660
yeah basically as I said

1510
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,240
is this a question for somebody in

1511
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,339
particular on the panel or whoever wants

1512
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:23,280
to take it whoever wants to take it

1513
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,559
I I could I could try

1514
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:28,440
um yes often you can solve some of these

1515
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,660
issues at the at the OS level

1516
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,460
um the dma does include specific

1517
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,200
interoperability obligations for

1518
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,140
operating systems as well so for example

1519
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,660
and and this was one of the this was one

1520
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,000
of the examples that commissioner vestea

1521
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,980
used when she launched the original

1522
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,400
proposal for the dma that um if you have

1523
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,920
an iPhone you'll know you can you can or

1524
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,799
Android you can use it to pay

1525
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,839
at terminals with your if you put your

1526
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:58,079
card details on the iPhone Apple

1527
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,140
has specific Hardware in the phone to to

1528
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,480
carry out that transaction which Apple

1529
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,579
doesn't allow any of its competitors to

1530
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:06,960
access so

1531
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,000
all of all other final financial

1532
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,799
institutions that want to let their

1533
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,900
customers use Apple pay have to go

1534
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,220
through Apple basically have to go

1535
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,099
through Apple pay and the the dma says

1536
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:19,619
no when you're in a position like apple

1537
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:21,359
where you control the hardware and the

1538
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,880
operating system and you're doing things

1539
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,619
with it for you know using your own

1540
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:27,540
software you will also have to allow

1541
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,140
your competitors so you know I'm I'm not

1542
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,059
I and most people are not using Apple's

1543
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,740
Financial Services they've got a

1544
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,079
partnership with Goldman Sachs um but

1545
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,400
they're not a big Bank obviously

1546
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,040
currently I mean they could be perhaps

1547
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,280
um but why can't I use my Banks app

1548
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,260
without having to go through Apple pay I

1549
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,420
mean I I'm I'm generally an Apple fan I

1550
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,099
like I like generally speaking their

1551
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:51,660
attitude to privacy not so much their

1552
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,119
attitude to competition and

1553
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,440
interoperability but yes you can you can

1554
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,420
do some of this through os's through

1555
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,240
alternative clients so I mean uh Chantal

1556
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,099
and esis

1557
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:04,079
um one of the things Article 19 was

1558
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,000
doing was saying in the Digital Services

1559
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,579
ACT people uses a very large online

1560
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,619
platforms should explicitly have an

1561
01:04:10,619 --> 01:04:12,599
option to use a different recommendation

1562
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:15,720
or curation algorithm on Facebook and so

1563
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,480
on that's one way of achieving this a

1564
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,220
parallel way is more along the lines

1565
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,079
that you're talking about it's using

1566
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,880
alternative clients like I mentioned

1567
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,220
earlier tweet bottle twitterific and so

1568
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,839
on to view your social media feed

1569
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,480
because the client can can apply the

1570
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,099
different algorithms to the the

1571
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:34,920
prioritizing of the the post and so on

1572
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,619
um so I think a lot of these mechanisms

1573
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:40,640
are complementary

1574
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,960
I had a question on them because we are

1575
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,299
you were talking about the signal and I

1576
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:52,859
think one of the things I remember that

1577
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:54,359
the people from signal was saying is

1578
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:56,280
that they were against

1579
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,440
um the idea of decentralized servers

1580
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,520
because they thought that it was

1581
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,500
impossible to

1582
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,420
to basically deploy the kind of security

1583
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:05,700
that they were that they were providing

1584
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,260
you know in that way so something I

1585
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,000
would I thought would be if you can

1586
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,559
maybe open up a bit like the difference

1587
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,220
between interoperability as we see it

1588
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,380
decentralization and federal Federation

1589
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,880
because I think that all these things

1590
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,160
that we can we get them bundled up a bit

1591
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,160
you know and where our the fourth

1592
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,299
alternative which I think is something

1593
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,339
that's been you know dealt in the room

1594
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,140
which is like simply break them up you

1595
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,660
know and just like go on a straight you

1596
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,599
know anti you know like Monopoly just

1597
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,059
start breaking them in a separate the

1598
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,160
vertical integration

1599
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,799
that's a great question any takers

1600
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:47,339
because I'm not gonna nominate if not

1601
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,559
no well I agree I think we actually have

1602
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:53,280
to to have that discussion and uh

1603
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,260
part it is a philosophical so of course

1604
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,799
if I just stay alone in my room no one

1605
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,540
will actually have a way to communicate

1606
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,400
with me but that will be very secure and

1607
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,940
private so there's I'm not convinced

1608
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,420
that I mean people that say that they

1609
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,799
are the only people that can provide a

1610
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,500
secure service and I tend to disagree I

1611
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,079
mean I think that there are good public

1612
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,119
practice for security and if the

1613
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:20,400
standard is done good that there will be

1614
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,040
uh that will apply to everyone then I

1615
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,660
mean of course it's a matter of choice

1616
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,359
but interoperability is what enables

1617
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,160
Federation and the centralized

1618
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,220
decentralization but again users are not

1619
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,140
forced to take it if you don't want to

1620
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,480
interact with anyone else you just I

1621
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,039
mean you can have your own but by the

1622
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:39,839
way by by having Open Standards what you

1623
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,280
can do you can have private deployments

1624
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,500
so you can you can take that let's say

1625
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,299
the global instant messaging standard if

1626
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,339
that will ever happen and then you can

1627
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:49,079
install your own your server that you

1628
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,700
only use with your friends and you are

1629
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,780
the only ones that can communicate

1630
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,700
through it and I mean that happens with

1631
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,859
Matrix for example and it's another way

1632
01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:59,460
if you want to have additional security

1633
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,700
how is that answer are you

1634
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,059
do you want some

1635
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:07,200
complimentary remarks from Ian or

1636
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,520
somebody else

1637
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,640
just one very briefly I would say I mean

1638
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,980
I absolutely agree with Vittorio I I

1639
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,079
greatly admire I greatly admire signal

1640
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,880
you know as an organization and as a

1641
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,260
product they're not the only

1642
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,819
organization in the world that can run

1643
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:24,000
highly secure messaging service clearly

1644
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,220
um and uh I don't have any particular

1645
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,500
problems with signals privacy policies

1646
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,420
as such that's why I that's why I use

1647
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,799
them but

1648
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:34,079
um they are subject to U.S jurisdiction

1649
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,020
which which you know potentially puts

1650
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,700
all sorts of surveillance obligations on

1651
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,099
them the product is designed in a way to

1652
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:43,020
minimize the data that signal as an

1653
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:45,059
organization can find out about you but

1654
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:48,539
you know that's it's not zero and we we

1655
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:51,059
may not know now because the US

1656
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:53,520
government can place secret obligations

1657
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,880
on companies under U.S jurisdiction to

1658
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,339
share information with the with the US

1659
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,140
government so I would like the choice

1660
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,119
with signal actually to have my messages

1661
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,819
hosted in a European server not in a not

1662
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:08,720
in a US server

1663
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,480
thank you there's the personal line what

1664
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,059
I wanted to say so

1665
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:16,198
yeah

1666
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,420
um I just wanted to add from my site if

1667
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,460
you don't mind uh when it comes to the

1668
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,439
web and understanding kind of how the

1669
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,420
web works I think it's a great example

1670
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,339
of how things work when you have

1671
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:28,979
underlying standards I mean in reality

1672
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,620
you can you can in technically speaking

1673
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,460
you can connect any browser uh to to any

1674
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,738
site on the internet now obviously from

1675
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,540
a competitive point of view you will

1676
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,000
find that

1677
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,040
competitors try to to block things and

1678
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,738
particularly when they're in a

1679
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:48,600
positional power so this is where the

1680
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,580
digital markets act come in and the like

1681
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,979
but technically speaking if there's a

1682
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:56,100
will there's a way to to open up uh for

1683
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,500
interoperability in this way for for

1684
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,420
messaging services there's no question

1685
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,960
about that

1686
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:13,439
Brussels I have a maybe have my question

1687
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:17,520
is for uh first question is for Chantal

1688
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,660
and uh basically you know like could you

1689
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,120
say something about your experience with

1690
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,460
promoting you know like interoperability

1691
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,380
in the social media space you know in

1692
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,799
the policy uh Arena uh I have the sense

1693
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:34,979
that like we ran into pretty significant

1694
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,080
opposition from let's say the broader

1695
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,219
law enforcement uh community and

1696
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,140
um you know most of that opposition I

1697
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,540
think wasn't necessarily public but you

1698
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,698
know it was of the form like we prefer

1699
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:49,380
actually just a bunch of centralized

1700
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,060
platforms because they're much more

1701
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,640
effective in establishing relationships

1702
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,280
with and making sure that certain kind

1703
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,500
of harmful stuff and illegal content is

1704
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,420
being addressed and and generally kind

1705
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,520
of is a better situation for law

1706
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,840
enforcement and government to have

1707
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,900
leverage over social media spaces of

1708
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,000
course we also ran into that kind of

1709
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,340
being voiced quite publicly by by

1710
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,679
Francis Hogan you know said like all the

1711
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,719
interoperability is like the worst

1712
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,760
you can think about you know that's

1713
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,000
spreading the problems and um so it's

1714
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,159
like that is uh that's quite a

1715
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:24,900
significant opposition

1716
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,360
that exist in the in the social media

1717
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,280
interoperability space and I'm just

1718
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,500
curious where you where you feel that we

1719
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,080
we we landed and now that the DSA has

1720
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,060
been concluded and maybe then a question

1721
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,580
for the whole panel you know like so one

1722
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:39,960
of the things about the interoperability

1723
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,540
and let's say article 7 of the dma which

1724
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,699
has the interoperability requirement or

1725
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,739
the possibility of interoperability for

1726
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:50,100
the messaging services it takes actually

1727
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:52,860
a lot of work to do this in practice you

1728
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,960
know like you need to work on like the

1729
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,239
implementation it's it's it's it's a

1730
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:59,100
really labor intensive both on the

1731
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,500
industry and the service side the

1732
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,600
technical side but also for policy

1733
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,600
makers and and I I don't have the sense

1734
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,179
that uh it's a big priority for the

1735
01:11:09,179 --> 01:11:11,400
European commission there's a like just

1736
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,040
an enormous task in in starting to

1737
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,040
enforce the dma and I don't think this

1738
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,380
is very high on the list but what are

1739
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,840
the what are the ways in which this can

1740
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,900
be made into a higher priority

1741
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,060
for the for the commission but what are

1742
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,440
your thoughts on like pushing the

1743
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,120
commission and

1744
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,219
um people here in Brussels to take this

1745
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:35,780
more seriously in the implementation

1746
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,500
and I always think of this

1747
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,060
I can uh yeah maybe start thanks for the

1748
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,040
question it's a great question

1749
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,739
um so on the one hand yes um as you say

1750
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:49,620
precisely law enforcement

1751
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,140
um is very keen on having to deal all

1752
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:56,340
around the world um so UK turkey Tunisia

1753
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,560
wherever they are very

1754
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,679
um Keen of having to deal with only

1755
01:12:00,679 --> 01:12:04,080
quite few players and being able because

1756
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,500
that will facilitate them being able to

1757
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,140
control or or have as you say direct

1758
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,760
relationships

1759
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,440
um and in that and this is basically one

1760
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,120
of the reasons which confirms why we

1761
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,480
want more decentralization because we do

1762
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,820
not want um because it is also one of

1763
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,699
the means to basically limit government

1764
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,699
control on user speech because they will

1765
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:28,199
have many more actors that they will

1766
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,699
have to deal with

1767
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,219
um same with the requirements to host

1768
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:34,860
um data um physically as well in the

1769
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,820
country

1770
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,980
and so we have definitely encountered

1771
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,440
opposition from law enforcement of

1772
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,540
course also from the biggest companies

1773
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,699
who are not particularly Keen

1774
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:46,020
um to get

1775
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:49,620
um to get that competition and and also

1776
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,380
we need we need to clarify when it comes

1777
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:55,560
to sometimes the narrative is also a bit

1778
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,659
um that we are inviting any sort of

1779
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:00,120
Rogue actors to come in

1780
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,860
um that might be even less

1781
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:03,659
um human rights compliance in their

1782
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:06,719
policies and and the way and and their

1783
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,040
activities and the way they conduct

1784
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,199
their business then say meta but of

1785
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,000
course um and also maybe to respond a

1786
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,820
bit to John's point we don't say

1787
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,739
interoperability is the only solution it

1788
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:19,380
needs to go hand in hand of course with

1789
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,020
with respect for for human rights

1790
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,480
standards uh the collection of data as

1791
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,219
he's done today is a clear infringement

1792
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:28,679
of the right to privacy so these are

1793
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:30,840
complementary measures

1794
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,520
um and in that sense

1795
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:36,300
um we we do think that if if the human

1796
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,340
rights standards are clear for the new

1797
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,340
players as well and for the current ones

1798
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,980
that again this will this will be a

1799
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:46,440
beneficial overall and we do think that

1800
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,719
we have been able particularly with the

1801
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,239
digital markets act as I mentioned at

1802
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:53,719
the start to bring in this human rights

1803
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:56,820
component to to the competition debate

1804
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,520
so again it didn't go as far as we

1805
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,860
wanted to but we do see it very much as

1806
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,620
a start of a sort of anti-monopoly

1807
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,360
movement that is connected with a strong

1808
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,480
Human Rights Movement with civil society

1809
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,340
being at the table when it's about the

1810
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:13,080
enforcement of the dma and very much so

1811
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,760
as well with the DSA of course because

1812
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:19,140
also the DSA puts human rights lists as

1813
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,780
one of his core objectives it has a lot

1814
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,239
of mention two fundamental rights and

1815
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,880
Civil Society organizations etc etc so

1816
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,219
yes there is strong opposition but we do

1817
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:30,600
think

1818
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,560
um things in certain uh spaces and in

1819
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,659
the European Union are going in the

1820
01:14:36,659 --> 01:14:37,739
right direction and this is something

1821
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:41,239
that we can continue to build on

1822
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,360
and can I also invite all the panelists

1823
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,480
to reflect on on the second part of

1824
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,940
yours question when it comes to

1825
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:55,400
how can uh we how can the European

1826
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,140
commission put this more at the

1827
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,659
Forefront in terms of uh next policy

1828
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:02,760
objectives when there's so much concern

1829
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,820
about enforcement of the DSA and dma

1830
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,620
and um

1831
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:10,560
Victoria Yeah well yeah before coming

1832
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,199
today I'd like to just mention that my

1833
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,540
perception early last year this was was

1834
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,980
that the interoperability of social

1835
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,100
media was blocked not too much because

1836
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,219
of law enforcement proper let's say

1837
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:24,540
concerns but because of National

1838
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,060
Security concerns and political concerns

1839
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,580
on like uh basically to say they say

1840
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,920
this bluntly and don't quote me how are

1841
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,900
we gonna take down Russian propaganda if

1842
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,460
the rather than just having to deal with

1843
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,980
Facebook we have to deal with like like

1844
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,400
1000 different systems so that because I

1845
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,560
mean then especially last year this was

1846
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,260
yeah the top concern but I mean coming

1847
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:48,600
to implementation yeah well we have to

1848
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,280
create demand so we have to show that

1849
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,380
there are people out there that want to

1850
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,699
build the interoperable instant

1851
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:55,739
messaging applications or all the others

1852
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:57,239
you know just waiting for The

1853
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:58,860
Gatekeepers to open up the interfaces

1854
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,960
and this is a task for the free software

1855
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,120
community and well we actually have them

1856
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,560
because in the end we have Matrix I

1857
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,239
think most of us are also already using

1858
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,460
Matrix and the people from Matrix from

1859
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,960
Redmond are actually very active in this

1860
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,500
discussion so but I mean that that's the

1861
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,380
really what you have I mean we have to

1862
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:17,940
show that there are people waiting for

1863
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,620
these people and companies because as we

1864
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,739
said I mean if it's important for

1865
01:16:22,739 --> 01:16:25,080
digital rights activists to stand up but

1866
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,100
there are parts of the European

1867
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,840
Parliament that maybe say okay you know

1868
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,120
it's the usual activist and if

1869
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,460
businesses started to say European

1870
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:35,219
businesses we do this we want this and

1871
01:16:35,219 --> 01:16:36,840
then they start to list the more it's

1872
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,699
unfortunate but that's how it is and

1873
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,140
this is why companies like I mean all

1874
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,400
the European open source software

1875
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,199
industry is starting to become active

1876
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,320
and we've been doing things around this

1877
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,739
and technically it's not so complex I

1878
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:50,699
mean that there are by the way

1879
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:52,860
standardization efforts uh going on

1880
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:55,739
starting at the iitf and I mean that

1881
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:58,199
there's some it's really more of a

1882
01:16:58,199 --> 01:16:59,760
matter of convincing negative is not to

1883
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,860
do too much assistance and we we don't

1884
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:03,420
know how well we be but from a

1885
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,920
commission's Viewpoint the problem is

1886
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,199
that they they feel this is hard because

1887
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,760
they it's a new problem and they don't

1888
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,380
have the skills I'd say in the sense

1889
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,420
that that they have people that are very

1890
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,520
competent that regulation and Anti-Trust

1891
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,860
and but they don't have a technical

1892
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,320
experts in at least understanding not

1893
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,880
enough and not of the right type in the

1894
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,980
industry so the problem is how can we

1895
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,840
build something which is sort of a mixed

1896
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,659
effort between the commission and the

1897
01:17:27,659 --> 01:17:29,520
community that I mean everybody in

1898
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,560
Europe that cares about this so that we

1899
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,780
can maybe provide them with the

1900
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,520
technical and practical expertise on

1901
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,960
what they should be asking their Keepers

1902
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,760
to do and then of course we'll see

1903
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,540
whether they list them

1904
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,699
next on this question

1905
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,260
uh Ian can we hear from you

1906
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,500
yeah sure I I think in a way people need

1907
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,500
to realize that when it comes to privacy

1908
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,140
privacy is also security matter and I

1909
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,840
think in a way a lot of the issues that

1910
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,580
we're dealing with misinformation and

1911
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,800
the like would not be there if it wasn't

1912
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,860
for the recommendation engines right so

1913
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,520
again it's tied to the fact which is why

1914
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,440
I mean you look at someone I mean

1915
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,239
Facebook has been talking about how many

1916
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,679
people they have working on dealing with

1917
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,420
misinformation and the like so basically

1918
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,480
you create a system that propagates

1919
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,179
misinformation and then you hire a lot

1920
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:32,580
of people to deal with it now it's a lot

1921
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,800
easier if you look at the kind of how

1922
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,300
things worked in the old days if you had

1923
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,400
a crazy person saying something silly

1924
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,840
somewhere on the internet you wouldn't

1925
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,060
know because you would never see it now

1926
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,100
the algorithms now take that information

1927
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,560
and push it to the Forefront so we need

1928
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,440
to basically understand that again the

1929
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,880
algorithms are part of the problem

1930
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,480
distributed systems are better I think

1931
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,460
from a privacy perspective also from the

1932
01:18:56,460 --> 01:19:00,080
perspective of of dealing with uh

1933
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,699
all how the how the flow of information

1934
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:04,560
is going anyone that's playing with the

1935
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,360
new technologies I mean there's a lot of

1936
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,179
focus on the on the messaging apps now I

1937
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,620
think in some ways The Social Network

1938
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,620
apps are even I mean more interesting in

1939
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:16,020
in a way because again the algorithms

1940
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,580
deciding the content that you're seeing

1941
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,679
in the Leica part of that equation to a

1942
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,140
greater extent and and I really think

1943
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,320
that again those algorithms are a very

1944
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,659
big part of the problem so I think

1945
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:29,940
people have been thinking that okay we

1946
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,739
need to give a privacy for the sake of

1947
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:34,080
security I would like to go in the other

1948
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,420
direction and saying our lack of privacy

1949
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:39,239
is is a significant security problem and

1950
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:41,219
we need to resolve that and that's also

1951
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:43,560
why I mean I'm all for interoperability

1952
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,040
just not if it's cementing the the

1953
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,260
sharing of data about what we are and

1954
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,440
who we are and uh I mean that that's

1955
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,500
where it becomes of a problem right

1956
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,199
thank you we have uh one more question

1957
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:01,199
in the room and uh I'd like the

1958
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,760
panelists when they answer that question

1959
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,280
to also build in their final remarks as

1960
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,960
we're coming close to the end of the

1961
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,020
session and I hope our predictions uh

1962
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,199
judge did not forget to monitor Macedon

1963
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,540
and Twitter because we have uh three

1964
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:20,100
little Awards to uh to hand on

1965
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,400
um so please thank you you'll be really

1966
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,320
glad I don't have a question I just have

1967
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,920
a comment so uh if that's okay so my

1968
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,659
name is Duane from a small privacy

1969
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,940
wardrobe organization based in Croatia I

1970
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,280
just have a comment on The Narrative of

1971
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,960
the promise of third-party

1972
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,020
recommendation systems and what it can

1973
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,300
bring so even in this panel I see that

1974
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,159
most of the

1975
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,940
line of thinking is uh connected to you

1976
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,400
know quality of the public debate and

1977
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,520
misinformation but Francis Hogan

1978
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,620
testified that basically most of the

1979
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,540
things that we see as negative in social

1980
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:00,900
networks would just melt away if we

1981
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,900
dealt with the engagement based ranking

1982
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,380
so in a sense this ranking system is

1983
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,380
behind you know massacres in in Myanmar

1984
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,980
The Civil Wars in Africa uh teen Eating

1985
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:19,920
Disorders on Instagram uh so basically I

1986
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,199
would just suggest sort of uh painting

1987
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:24,480
the more broad picture of This Promise

1988
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,239
of new recommendation systems and maybe

1989
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:30,540
framing it as a well-being of the

1990
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:33,300
society and even the individual and I

1991
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,460
would opt for this especially in line of

1992
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:38,280
the growing scientific growing body of

1993
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,239
scientific work that directly links uh

1994
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,400
this pandemic of mental health issues

1995
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,400
among the young with the use of social

1996
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,159
media so in a sense this would not just

1997
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,679
Safeguard the public debate it would

1998
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,360
also Safeguard the well-being of a

1999
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,060
society and individuals and especially

2000
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,020
the young kids who have like

2001
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,600
increasing increasing rates of mental

2002
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,120
disorders which are continuing even

2003
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,000
today so that's just a small comment

2004
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,900
thank you thank you

2005
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:13,140
in the back do you have a real question

2006
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,500
uh if it's quick then we can take it is

2007
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,860
it quick

2008
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,219
and in the meantime I'd like the panel

2009
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:27,000
to to reflect on one final thought they

2010
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,360
they want to share uh with the audience

2011
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,280
or with the European commission if they

2012
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,440
do have recommendations for how to

2013
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,440
implement interoperability

2014
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,159
um in the 2024 mandate

2015
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:42,780
um

2016
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,239
and one more thing that I also forgot

2017
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:47,280
but let's let's let's hear the question

2018
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,360
first

2019
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,820
yeah I hope it doesn't broaden the scope

2020
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,560
too much but we've talked a lot about

2021
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,800
like messaging apps and the fact that

2022
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,800
and uh and praise the the rise of our

2023
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,159
Open Standards and the operability and

2024
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,380
and also many in the past have predicted

2025
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,199
the death of email and yet nobody is

2026
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,540
using gpg right and so I was thinking

2027
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,640
like in terms of interoperability and

2028
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,980
also the platform and also about like a

2029
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,080
competition and um

2030
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,659
and the the enforcement of privacy laws

2031
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:20,340
what

2032
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,100
what is your prediction about emails in

2033
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,280
the future of uh privacy laws and

2034
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,800
platforms

2035
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,080
okay I would to be honest I would go

2036
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,320
even more radical I would say like

2037
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,020
how can we reimagine the whole

2038
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,420
architecture of infrastructure like

2039
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:42,719
maybe separating the infrastructure

2040
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,140
layer from the user interface layer from

2041
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:47,820
the data collection layer and I think

2042
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:51,000
that offers a lot more opportunities in

2043
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,780
in terms of really rethinking how uh how

2044
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,840
platforms work but I know Ian also wrote

2045
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,679
um an article if I'm not mistaken

2046
01:24:00,679 --> 01:24:04,620
myth busting what uh Francis Hogan said

2047
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:07,080
about interoperability so maybe he can

2048
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,719
bring in that point very quickly and

2049
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:12,060
then uh one final thought from from our

2050
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,719
panelists

2051
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:18,960
well very specifically and

2052
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,960
um

2053
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,920
what Haugen said to the European

2054
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,900
Parliament was interpreted at one point

2055
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,360
as she was against interoperability that

2056
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,980
I then talked more to the people who

2057
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,260
basically had planned her grand tour of

2058
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,340
Europe

2059
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:33,960
um and what they said was she was

2060
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,820
talking about the DSA very specifically

2061
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,679
and not about the dma and its

2062
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,420
interoperability

2063
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:42,179
uh obligations I I

2064
01:24:42,179 --> 01:24:44,100
but bringing it that back to yoris's

2065
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:44,940
question

2066
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,560
um I think absolutely there were

2067
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,739
concerns about in in the EU Council

2068
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:51,300
about disinformation and what

2069
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,280
interoperable social media would do to

2070
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,679
attempts to reduce disinformation I

2071
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,780
think all those concerns have good

2072
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,159
answers

2073
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:00,480
um

2074
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,640
I mean I I don't doubt that what

2075
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,460
Vittorio said was correct Also I spoke

2076
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,080
to one of the most senior people in the

2077
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,060
council at the time

2078
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,580
um the dma was was being finalized and

2079
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,440
he his his

2080
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,260
concern was much much more basic and

2081
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,300
really I sort of slightly put my head in

2082
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,120
my hands afterwards this was a minister

2083
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,440
who said I can't imagine what

2084
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,120
interoperable social media looks like

2085
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,640
and I mean I tried to explain I mean

2086
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,620
what I should have I I found that

2087
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,659
baffling given you know Mastodon isn't

2088
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:33,300
only you know six months old Mastodon

2089
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,159
even at the time had four million user

2090
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:36,120
accounts

2091
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,960
um I mean it seems pretty

2092
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,000
straightforward to me but that that has

2093
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,920
been one of the problems in having these

2094
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,719
conversations with politicians they're

2095
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,120
not technical experts that's fine

2096
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,219
um but their their sort of vision of the

2097
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:49,679
world seems very constrained by what

2098
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,300
what they're familiar with themselves

2099
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,000
what tools they use clearly they hadn't

2100
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,560
used Mastodon

2101
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,239
um and I think

2102
01:25:57,239 --> 01:25:59,340
that's one of the positive things about

2103
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:01,500
the the dma messaging interoperability

2104
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,659
obligation it will make a lot more

2105
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,760
people familiar with the the idea of

2106
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,060
interoperability over time I hope

2107
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:12,600
I'm getting a very

2108
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,980
um

2109
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,719
you know expensive signs that

2110
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:18,120
unfortunately would need to to wrap up

2111
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,360
the session uh here uh I would like the

2112
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,699
to ask the panelists that the remaining

2113
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:26,760
panelists if they can still post their

2114
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,060
answers on Macedon or or Twitter so that

2115
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,940
we don't leave this discussion uh

2116
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:36,659
hanging in the air and
