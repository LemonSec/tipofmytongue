1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
once again

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,820
hello can you hear me well

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,720
thanks so welcome to this uh this

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,460
session on data retention you might

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,380
wonder why are we talking still now

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,140
today about the day retention again well

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,300
this is something we're gonna

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,180
get it into it's the title of the panel

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,439
is not really

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,159
um

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
it's a bit alarming but it's also

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,840
optimistic as you can see

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,120
um I'll be your mother the moderator

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,700
today I'm as a disclaimer I'm the

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,680

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,420
late

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,280
so while he's away I can still see what

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,719

and he he works for the greens IFA group

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,539
more generally

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,000
you may have noticed that data retention

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
is a topic that comes and goes we talk

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,680
about it as PDP actually I'm not here at

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
Price Camp it's been many years there's

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,240
been multiple panels but also multiple

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,380
court of justice cases

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,920
each with a slightly modified question

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,700
to the courts

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,240
um

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,598
so why are we here today what what has

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
changed since the last time

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620
you might wonder maybe you know that

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,739
there's not that much new compared to a

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,220
year ago well there's been at least one

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,020
new law that has been passed and there's

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,940
a couple that have been stricken down

52
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,459
we'll get into this

53
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,239
um

54
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,640
Patrick just arrived so we it's perfect

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,020
we're going to start

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,239
um let me start with you

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,640
you presented a couple months ago your

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,780
research at the Luis conference in Italy

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,459
it goes

60
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,940
um it's about how the security objective

61
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,099
in

62
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,900
correspond to the

63
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,239
sorry how the seriousness of the

64
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,860
security objectives pursued by the data

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,739
intention compared to in corresponding

66
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,599
compared to the seriousness of the

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,580
interference to from the fundamental

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,739
rights can you tell us more about this

69
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,840
research of yours and I'll give you my

70
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,700
thank you very much also for the

71
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,680
organizers for having me and for Simeon

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,620
for the introduction indeed you can also

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,080
find a lot of this informational

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,260
discussing today in on a presentation I

75
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,080
get on the caregiver 11 website

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,840
so I would like to discuss today the

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,360
judicial regulation of mass and data

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,260
retention and some challenges that arise

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,300
I imagine as experts you probably have

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,220
heard some of the things before but I

81
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,900
hope that we can engage into more

82
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,180
discussion in relation to three specific

83
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,780
challenges as mentioned by Simeon how

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,599
the court of justice has developed this

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,500
hierarchy whereby the more important the

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
policy interest objective is it must be

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,900
proportionate to the seriousness of the

88
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,599
interference in Gert by fundamental

89
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
rights to privacy and to data protection

90
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
so according to the court

91
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
and the most important security

92
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,599
objective it is capable of justifying

93
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,720
the more serious interferences and the

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,760
more processing operations are allowed

95
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,220
and on the top we have the safeguarding

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,739
of National Security

97
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,660
which is the most important security

98
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,720
objective in the middle we have the

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,720
protection of public security and the

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,300
fight against serious crime and on the

101
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,699
bottom we have the fight against Crime

102
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,960
which is allows for at least intrusive

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,600
and the non-serious interferences with

104
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
privacy and data protection

105
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,600
so what the court considers on the top

106
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
National Security allows it is capable

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,880
of justifying what the core refers to as

108
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,759
the more serious interferences and those

109
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,280
are for instance the preventive Mass

110
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,340
retention of

111
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,300
metadata electronic communications

112
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,400
metadata but also the real-time

113
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,740
collection and automated analysis of

114
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,020
metadata

115
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,820
in the middle the fight against serious

116
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,759
crime and protection of public security

117
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,340
for that purpose only serious

118
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,400
interferences may be justified and those

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,120
can be incurred by for example Mass

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,000
rotation of IP addresses and targeted

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
data metadata retention

122
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,440
and the fight against Crime can only

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,900
justify non-serious interferences such

124
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,419
as the mass retention of civil identity

125
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,500
data

126
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,740
so we already know that the EU the the

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,380
European Court the European judge has

128
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,900
allowed Mass data surveillance and I

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,880
would like to focus on three challenges

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,919
in relation to First the security

131
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,100
objective then or first the seriousness

132
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,660
of the interference then the security

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,060
objective and then the distinction

134
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,979
between mass and targeted

135
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,199
so first how can we

136
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,880
um

137
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,440
distinguish what the type of

138
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,360
interference whether it's serious or

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,400
non-series

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,919
to start with data retention in itself

141
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,440
regardless of any harm or sensitive data

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,960
being included constitutes an

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,360
interference and that conclusion is even

144
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,060
more Justified vis-a-vis privacy when

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,340
sensitive information is included

146
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,560
then the court has found that the

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,539
processing of data which do not allow

148
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,160
precise conclusions to be drawn about

149
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,400
individuals leads to a non-serious

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,740
interference and that was for example in

151
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,440
Ministry of skull the same conclusion is

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,380
here worth it is not worthy to to say

153
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,039
that the same conclusions was drawn with

154
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,139
regards to the processing of Passenger

155
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,020
Name Records data in the context of the

156
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,600
EU Canada International agreement

157
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,880
whereby the court had said at the time

158
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,979
that the processing of this large

159
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,440
amounts of data despite the fact that

160
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
they can reveal a lot of sensitive

161
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,280
information and are subject automated

162
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,979
processing does not constitute a serious

163
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,360
interference

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,220
the exact opposite was now recently

165
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,440
concluded with regards to passenger Name

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
Records data processing in the context

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,900
of the EU and as regards the PNR

168
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,940
directive and in there the court said

169
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,199
that the PNR data processing because it

170
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,500
is continuous systematic and untargeted

171
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
it undoubtedly entails a serious

172
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,819
interference

173
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,099
and a similar reasoning was also used in

174
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,960
the digital rights Ireland ruling

175
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,060
whereby the court mention of how this

176
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,160
wide-ranging data retention creates this

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,039
feeling of constant surveillance so we

178
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,380
can see that perhaps this um

179
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,780
element of constant and continuous

180
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,819
surveillance is important for assessing

181
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,160
seriousness of interferences

182
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,500
and finally what the court consider as

183
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,479
the more serious interference on the top

184
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,720
of the hierarchy is to my knowledge only

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,340
being discussed in the context of

186
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,319
National Security

187
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
so the most decisive Factor seems to be

188
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,819
whether there is sensitive information

189
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,039
and whether that information allows to

190
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,800
draw specific conclusions about

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
individuals lives private lives the

192
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,039
court is quite focused on privacy and

193
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,380
often assess this seriousness of

194
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,940
interference in a quite

195
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,099
conjoined assessment and here it is

196
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,979
perhaps interesting to to ask whether

197
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,020
assessing the right to data protection

198
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,139
alone and interferences with the right

199
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,260
to data protection could be assessed

200
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,080
independently not only as a means to

201
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,899
safeguard privacy but also pursuing

202
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,940
goals of safeguarding fundamental rights

203
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,300
more broadly as well as empowering

204
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,980
individuals against Power and

205
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,380
informational asymmetries so in this

206
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,860
case an interference should be a serious

207
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,560
and even more serious simply by the fact

208
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
that this vast amounts of data being

209
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,700
collected amplify quite significantly

210
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,100
the power and informational symmetries

211
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,339
between the citizen and the government

212
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,000
now the Second Challenge I would like to

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,620
discuss is how to distinguish between

214
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,500
this first objective or the more serious

215
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,019
objective of National Security and the

216
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,740
objective of protecting public security

217
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,420
um the court considers that these two

218
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,180
types of threats are distinguishable by

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,000
their nature seriousness and the

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
specific nature of circumstances and

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,820
mass data retention is allowed when

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,360
there is a present or at least

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,700
foreseeable threat against National

224
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,459
Security which is distinguishable by

225
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,740
their threats to public security which

226
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,620
are according to the court general and

227
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,060
permanent

228
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,860
however if we see how in EU law and case

229
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,680
law these two concepts are defined very

230
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,660
often a lot of the same terminologies

231
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
used and while National Security is not

232
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,560
defined in the law as such the Accord of

233
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,420
justice has given a sort of definition

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,660
and public security it was initially

235
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,360
kind of defined in case law regarding

236
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,360
the fundamental freedoms of movement

237
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,180
and now you also can find definitions on

238
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,740
public security within the law

239
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,420
enforcement data protection directive

240
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,060
and the regulation on the free flow of

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,940
data and in those definitions we see

242
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,560
that both National and public security

243
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,140
are defined by making references to the

244
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,180
protection of fundamental interests of

245
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,519
society protecting Assessment Services

246
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,700
the survival of the population

247
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,260
Interstate relations and even military

248
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,680
interests

249
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,380
an area which is traditionally appointed

250
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,540
National Security is now also used to

251
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,700
describe public security

252
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,959
so nothing to that of course is the

253
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,380
thorny topic of terrorism which is

254
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,720
falling under both and that has been

255
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
explicitly recognized for example in

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,200
Lakota Nets and while terrorism is part

257
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,019
of National Security on the other hand

258
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,200
in for example the PNR directive ruling

259
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,480
that I mentioned earlier there the court

260
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,880
was more reluctant to accept that actual

261
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
intelligence services will have access

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,860
to this data because they also pursue

263
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,040
this same objective

264
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,380
so the guidance from the court on how to

265
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,560
differentiate these two

266
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,260
types of threads might be a little bit

267
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,480
limited and neglecting that definitional

268
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,920
confusion as well as how in practice

269
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,200
security agencies are increasingly and

270
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,360
more closely collaborating further

271
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,940
blaring the lines ultimately the most

272
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,740
decisive Factor seems to be a temporal

273
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,899
one between present and foreseeable and

274
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,660
general impairment and in in such a

275
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,300
dynamic environment such as security it

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,060
might not be as clear and as easy to to

277
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,700
draw the lines there either

278
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,740
so as invoking a different security

279
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,000
purpose allows for mass or Target the

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,980
data retention the question inevitably

281
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,440
arises whether member states will try to

282
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
label more operations as protecting

283
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,700
against foreseeable threats to National

284
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,640
Security in order to impose Mass data

285
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,019
retention

286
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,360
and finally the third challenge I would

287
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,779
like to uh bring forward relates to the

288
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,700
issue on how to delineate between what

289
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,980
constitutes massive Mass data retention

290
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,920
and targeted retention according to the

291
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
courts mass is general and

292
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
indiscriminate while targeted is a debt

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,459
retention measure that is targeted in

294
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,880
relation to a specific time period a

295
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,399
geographic location

296
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,320
a person is likely to be involved in any

297
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,959
way to crime or persons who could for

298
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,300
other reasons contribute to the fight

299
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,980
against Crime

300
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,100
so insofar as restricting rotation to

301
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,620
geographical area is concerned there the

302
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,540
court has heard they're clarified that

303
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,839
this can happen for example by

304
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,000
restricting data retention to all the

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,700
people within a location that is

306
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,360
um

307
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,839
chosen because for instance of its

308
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,120
vulnerability or high risk of crime such

309
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,079
as airports or Maritime ports

310
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,899
so these criteria seem to neglect first

311
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,000
of all how targeted from a criminal

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,240
procedural perspective should be should

313
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,480
be more linked or related to a

314
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,180
reasonable suspicion and should be more

315
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,459
specific

316
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,920
um in relation to a specific threat or

317
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
crime and they also seem to neglect the

318
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,779
reality of advanced algorithmic tools

319
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,459
increasingly being used

320
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,300
the court has made a caveat that the

321
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,040
effectiveness of modern investigation

322
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
techniques should not lead to mass

323
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,399
surveillance

324
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,940
so this seems to imply that we should

325
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,040
find a balance between ensuring

326
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,920
effectiveness of new tools and not

327
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,339
leading to collection of data being Mass

328
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,920
however it might be difficult to draw

329
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,519
lines on what is considered an objective

330
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,339
link between the data to be collected as

331
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,740
targeted and the fight against Crime

332
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,560
when we have automated iron Predictive

333
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,200
Analytics employed which are notoriously

334
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,079
known as objective as initially thought

335
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,360
and they are inherently looking for

336
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,700
previously unknown threats and their

337
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,560
effectiveness actually depends on having

338
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,339
more rather than less data

339
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:47,639
so that could potentially make the link

340
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,680
between the threads and the broad

341
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
amounts of data to be collected more

342
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,880
easily established

343
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,100
and after all data contributing to the

344
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,440
fight against Crime maybe all the data

345
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,000
that helped to create an update

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,100
assessment criteria as is the case with

347
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,800
the aforementioned PNR directive whereby

348
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,980
one of the purposes of processing all

349
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,839
the passenger Name Records data of all

350
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,779
passengers within Europe is exactly to

351
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,000
create and update the pre-established

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,540
models on the basis of which we can make

353
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,519
risk assessments of passengers

354
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,260
so in this way even if member states

355
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,019
limit their practices on targeted data

356
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,360
retention that might still be not as

357
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
targeted as the court might think and to

358
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,720
wrap this up I would bring all this

359
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,420
regulation that the court has built is

360
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,320
built on the premise that data retention

361
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,019
is has a legal basis in a way in the

362
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,820
Privacy directive

363
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,899
and with the draft privacy regulation

364
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,360
further questions arise first of all

365
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,639
because the current draft for instance

366
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,920
exclude National Security from its

367
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,720
applicability

368
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,600
bringing conflict potentially with the

369
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,240
case law and second because actually

370
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,399
retention the references to retentions

371
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,040
have been deleted and there is only a

372
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,899
general restriction clause

373
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,920
so to conclude do we want to have the

374
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,199
regulation of mass and targeted data

375
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,100
retention by the courts or by the EU and

376
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,279
if it's so by the legislator should that

377
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,839
happen through

378
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,600
um secondary law like the Privacy that

379
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
concerns the confidence health of

380
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,500
communications or should we have a more

381
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,779
specified

382
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,279
framework and in that regard I think

383
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,560
that perhaps a new dedicated instrument

384
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,680
with a proper impact assessment having

385
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,019
sufficient empirical evidence on what

386
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,600
are exactly the security needs between

387
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,360
linking specific data to specific types

388
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,720
of crimes and the harms incurred not

389
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,660
only on privacy but also vis-a-vis data

390
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,060
protection as an empowering tool and

391
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,380
also taking into account of course

392
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,540
otherwise right Fair trial and

393
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,060
discrimination then we could perhaps

394
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,020
have a more clear regulation

395
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,799
yeah thank you very much

396
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:12,000
I think a couple of things that you've

397
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
said will be touched upon the next

398
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,140
speakers as well both about the

399
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,140
targeting of the retention and about the

400
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,839
new possible tools for for the EU as

401
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
well as about the effectiveness

402
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,400
um uh empirical evidence about the

403
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,299
effectiveness and needs for these tools

404
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,160
to begin with

405
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
um before I continue let me just I

406
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,720
started this panel very quick because we

407
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,240
were getting slightly late but I forgot

408
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,299
therefore to remind you that this is

409
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,860
live streamed

410
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,340
and that if there are

411
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,880
questions also from the online audience

412
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,100
these can be asked through the

413
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,980
intermediary of

414
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,559
Twitter or Mastodon but since I'm

415
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,240
sitting here and moderating this panel I

416
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
need someone from the audience to look I

417
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,260
need a volunteer thank you to look for

418
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,400
um

419
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,700
any questions with the hashtag hashtag

420
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,000
privacycam 2223 and hashtag data

421
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,860
retention so those of us who those of

422
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,440
you who are watching this online know

423
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,299
that you can still interact with us and

424
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,600
ask questions through

425
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,480
um through Twitter unless and with these

426
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,400
um hashtags

427
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,460
the audience is also uh invited even

428
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,400
though also those who are in person in

429
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,100
the event to ask questions I will give

430
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,380
the floor both at the end but also in

431
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,600
between speakers so if you have

432
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,160
questions please note them down or keep

433
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,480
them somewhere because otherwise you

434
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,940
might forget them happy to take them in

435
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,160
between different speakers

436
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,220
um

437
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
is there any question on what has been

438
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
said right now before we move to the

439
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,140
next was anything unclear or does any

440
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,419
specific point needs to get a bit more

441
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,900
in depth

442
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,480
if not we'll move on but think of your

443
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,299
questions uh ahead for the next ones

444
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,640
please amazing

445
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,700
um so

446
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,100
um you represent the Liga and the league

447
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,679
yes

448
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,080
um I assume you you're going to speak

449
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,820
about the Belgian data retention model

450
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,320
was adopted last August and specifically

451
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,919
about the topics of what is targeted in

452
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,940
a general indiscriminate manner in the

453
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,940
sorry when does a data retention law

454
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,919
that does something that is both

455
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,700
targeted and uh indiscriminate find the

456
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,080
balance

457
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,460
um

458
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,240
the floor is just

459
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,760
okay good afternoon

460
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,679
I hope that you understand what I want

461
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,539
to say because my English

462
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,660
is not so good

463
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,120
okay I am the lawyer from the league for

464
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,780
human rights the Flemish and French

465
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,059
league of human rights in Belgium we

466
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,500
have two legally human rights leaks

467
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,960
and I in Belgium there are at this

468
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
moment three

469
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,460
data retention lows

470
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,299
the first was from 2000 I give you a

471
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,900
short history to follow the discussion

472
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,080
the first low Belgian low data retention

473
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,020
low was from 2013.

474
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,320
and the Belgian constitutional Court

475
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,160
annulate this this low in 2016. first

476
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,460
law second low was from 2015

477
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,660
and the Constitutional Court annulates

478
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,080
this law in 2021

479
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,039
they annulate the second law after an

480
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,900
interruption by the European Court of

481
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,059
human rights to put so-called

482
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,059
presidential questions preliminary

483
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,679
questions

484
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,620
we were two days in the

485
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,140
The Fairly beautiful Hall of the

486
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,820
European court of justice in Luxembourg

487
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,340
you must go there when you want to see

488
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,700
the real work of the European court of

489
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,780
justice

490
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,020
we were there two days

491
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,659
to discuss the questions not only from

492
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,460
the Belgian constitutional court but

493
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,640
also France and the United Kingdom but

494
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,580
in the same procedure also prejudicial

495
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,960
questions to the European Court

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,080
it's remarkable that in this procedure

497
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,039
in Luxembourg 15 European countries do

498
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,740
an intervention normally when you go to

499
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,380
the European Court of human of Justice

500
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,860
the road to e45 European countries who

501
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,559
come in but in this case there are 15

502
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,260
countries present and also the European

503
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,860
Commission that underline the importance

504
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,880
of the the discussion that was happened

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,539
in September 2019 by the European court

506
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,280
of justice

507
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,679
the European court of justice maker that

508
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,159
Norm at that moment the so-called

509
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,640
judgment like

510
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,280
it's because it was the French party it

511
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,100
was the first party but it was also a

512
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,020
party of Great Britain and from Belgium

513
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,880
we were there with the leak for human

514
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
rights with the Barrow from the the

515
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
lawyers maybe some other persons

516
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,500
I come back on like quadrature because

517
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,860
it's a very important decision

518
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,980
then in 20 July of this year

519
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,159
20 July of this year the Belgian

520
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,700
Parliament vote a new the third new uh

521
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,340
anti-date data retention I say antibiot

522
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,159
data retention low

523
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,640
and we have time just at 6 February to

524
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,900
make appeal by the Belgian

525
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
constitutional court and we are at this

526
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,600
moment not I alone but also

527
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,700
to other lawyers we are preparing the

528
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,880
appeal by the Virgin constitutional

529
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,539
court for the third time we go there

530
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:38,159
we hope to win it but I will give you

531
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,260
some

532
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,620
continue about the third Persian law

533
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,020
that's the first part of the history the

534
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
Belgian situation

535
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,340
the second part of the history that's

536
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,320
what's happened by the European court of

537
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,020
justice because it's very important

538
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,299
because my opinion is that the European

539
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,120
court of justice

540
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,280
always take a good position

541
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,760
in this question also when the pressure

542
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,620
of all of many European countries was

543
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,179
fairly High

544
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,940
in the discussion when we were in

545
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,400
Luxembourg the representative of Ireland

546
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,340
say when you don't follow our position

547
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,419
you will have problems with your court

548
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,980
literally say that literally the the

549
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,740
pleasure the intimidation of the Court

550
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,140
was very very high

551
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,179
the court make the first decision about

552
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,760
the data retention was in

553
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
2014

554
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,179
the basic law

555
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,140
for the the a privacy

556
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,400
Direction directive

557
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,659
is from 2000 to 2002 then because at

558
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,320
that moment the the European uh

559
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
Parliament and other realized them that

560
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,100
they have to do something about the

561
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,360
communication the e-communication

562
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,780
because it was coming up it was happened

563
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,940
more and more that people did

564
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,360
communication by uh

565
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,360
digital elements

566
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,240
first decision of the European Court

567
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,940
digital rights

568
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,080
2014 second judgment

569
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,900
from 2016 and then we have the

570
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,960
quadrature the net

571
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,620
from 2020 and it's very important also

572
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,740
after like regardless there were two

573
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,020
other procedures by the European Court

574
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,320
about the same discussion also the

575
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
discussion about the German law

576
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,900
because there was a similar German

577
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,659
low-light the Belgian although but they

578
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,460
waited to take a decision about the

579
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,260
German law after that they take a

580
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,200
decision about the Belgian French and

581
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,779
law of the United Kingdom

582
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,500
there was a

583
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,559
important decision with the name

584
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,559
Commissioner of Anne Garda I think it's

585
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,880
from Ireland

586
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,640
in April 5 April 2022 last year fairly

587
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,000
recent and the most recent decision

588
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,220
Judgment of the European court of

589
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,539
justice was from 20 September of three

590
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,400
four months ago about the the German law

591
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,320
the name of that decision is space net

592
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,000
there's a Korean name to to speak about

593
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,020
this decision 20 September

594
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,140
2023 22.

595
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,580
that means that

596
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,120
in in this decision of space net the

597
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,440
European Court bring all their

598
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,840
statements together it's the basic to

599
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,240
discuss at this moment for instance the

600
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,000
third version

601
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,720
data retention law

602
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,000
and also later in the decision of space

603
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,960
net

604
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,940
uh

605
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,679
you have to know that the central

606
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,179
discussion

607
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,120
is about article

608
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,840
15.1 of the e-privacy directive

609
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,380
and this article was also Central in the

610
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,600
discussion in Luxembourg and this

611
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,740
article say that European elective that

612
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,320
there can be restriction

613
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,600
from privacy when it's necessary

614
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,120
appropriate and proportionate measure

615
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,419
within a democratic Democratic Society

616
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:58,020
to safeguard National Security defense

617
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,600
public security and the prevention

618
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,760
investigation detection

619
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,299
and prosecution of criminal offenses or

620
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,840
of an authority authorized use of the

621
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,340
electronic communication system

622
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,419
what's important

623
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,820
is the the word in a Democratic Society

624
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,100
many people forget it but they think

625
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,600
yeah it's about discussion

626
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,840
proportionality and and necessarily also

627
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
that but the fundamental political

628
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,100
discussion is what how far can we go in

629
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,880
a Democratic Society to to stop and to

630
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,120
to survive the the communication of the

631
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,919
people that's the fundamental discussion

632
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,440
that people say yeah but look to China

633
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,020
look to Russia look to the United States

634
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,059
no that's not the discussion in Europe

635
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:53,940
the discussion is how far will Europe go

636
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,080
and Belgium go to to stay a Democratic

637
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,140
Society and how far will we go

638
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,240
okay what did uh

639
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:11,539
uh there's a the chart the the the

640

point of view of the European court of

651
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,620
justice

652
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,779
the Lord

653
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,779
just with a few of time since the

654
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,279
background might be already known by

655
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,700
some or perhaps most of the the audience

656
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,460
could you go a bit into the Belgian

657
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,980
analysis

658
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,360
that might be I know you're giving the

659
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,460
the framework for for understanding

660
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,200
what's happening in Belgium but just

661
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,260
with a view of time okay but the

662
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,899
question is when you discuss the Belgian

663
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,000
love you have to know about what was the

664
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,539
position of the European Court of just

665
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,000
that okay

666
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,720
you can find my uh

667
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,020

in order to explain this very

671
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,940
complicated uh question okay the Belgian

672
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,880
law

673
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,220

674
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,899
with the new Belgian law

675
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,299
in Belgium there is a

676
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,200
some men say when when men do something

677

English it seems to be in English Fox is

681
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,340
not caught twice in the same snail

682
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,779
and when I see to the third Belgian low

683
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,240
but also to the second one the second

684
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,460
one is worse than the first one and the

685
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,679
third one is still worse than the second

686
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,659
one

687
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:31,320
they in the in they do the opposite of

688
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,679
what the law the Belgian constitutional

689
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:36,659
court and the European court of justice

690
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,580
what they say

691
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,779
what is word sir

692
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:44,419
you have to make distinction between

693
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:48,200
Sterling of data

694
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,899
retaining of data on one side and the

695
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,179
access to that are two different

696
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,340
elements

697
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,120
about the stalling of data Belgium

698
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,200
in the new Belgian law say make a

699
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,179
difference between Sterling in

700
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,820
geographical zones and

701
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,159
the European Court

702
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,860
say you can do that storing in

703
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,220
geographical zones but under many

704
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,860
important conditions not not like that

705
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,740
Belgium low third version low

706
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,679
say that there must be starting in five

707
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,820
different geographical zones

708
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,779
first are the judicial judicial

709
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,960
districts and police districts with a

710
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,240
certain number of crimes per thousand

711
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,340
inhabitants

712
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,539
on average over the past three years

713
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,120
that means that when there are three

714
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,620
crimes

715
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,940
on Thousand persons in certain judicial

716
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,340
statistics of ballistic six

717
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,059
the they can order the operators to

718
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:09,679
collect the data from the people

719
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,399
that's

720
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,879
three

721
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,779
it's very low

722
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:27,840
they were controlled by the general Data

723
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,539
Bank from the police but in this data

724
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,880
Bank everything comes in this data bank

725
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,600
that's not make for this purpose and in

726
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,580
my opinion is that they never can do it

727
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,539
on on a good way second geographical

728
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:46,640
Zone or the zones or entire territory

729
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,799
determinated by the coordinating body

730
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:53,220
for treats analyze in Belgium is the

731
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,860
name Oak cuts

732
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,340
in case of tweet level three

733
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,000
level three and then they can do a

734
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,539
general and undifferentiated detention

735
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,379
I repeat your P the Luxembourg accepted

736
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,500
but also on the very strict conditions

737
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,540
and these conditions are not uh not in

738
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,440
in the Belgian though level three from

739
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,440
the Tweets in Belgium is the not the

740
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,060
highest level

741
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,540
the highest level is level four and

742
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,940
there is a important difference between

743
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,739
the third level and the fourth level I

744
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,780
think that maybe only in the fourth

745
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,159
level they can maybe applicate do an

746
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,440
application of this question

747
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,679
third Zone the areas particularly

748
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,139
exposed to treats to National Security

749
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,280
and serious crime

750
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,359
what are these areas

751
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,040
the 19 different

752
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,839
locations or areas

753
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,839
for instance all the Metros all the

754
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,780
prisons of the Armed dealers and

755
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,220
shooting Rangers the

756
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,020
municipalities with critical Network

757
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,119
Central and provisional Data Center

758
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,460
building and so on 19 different places

759
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,099
who also called a treat can be a treat

760
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,540
to National Security and serious

761
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,400
94 Ford Zone

762
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,180
the zone you can may post serious treats

763
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,599
to vital interests of the country or

764
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,300
essential population needs

765
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,579
what all these

766
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,099
Jonas

767
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,859
all the neutral zones and the Parliament

768
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,339
and all what's in in

769
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:01,980
in that position all the motorways all

770
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,540
the motorways and the packing of the

771
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,520
motorists you know Belgium is a very

772
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,040
small country you have everywhere motor

773
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,400
race

774
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,000
all the town halls all the townhouse the

775
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Royal Palace okay

776
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,619
the Royal domains the Constitutional

777
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,859
court and so on and also the Border

778
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,900
municipalities it's all the board

779
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,500
municipalities from this small country

780
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:37,140
can be see as a Zone to collect the data

781
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,599
the last synonym

782
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,720
or the potential potentially seriously

783
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,579
threatening the interest of

784
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,400
international institutions

785
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,859
established on national territory or

786
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,680
disease the European Union the

787
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,280
parliament of the Zona Schumann plan

788
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,780
Schumann place and so on the NATO the

789
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,060
European economic area the U.N

790
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,220
institutions in Belgium and so on

791
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,820
important is that this is in the law but

792
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,820
the law also said for the five zones

793
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,960
that the the government by Royal Decree

794
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,079
can make them broader

795
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,800
there are still very very broad when

796
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,859
when you look to the second important

797
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,160
point is that they say it depends also

798
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,500
from the pyramid how long will you go

799
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,560
with this Zone there is no perimeter in

800
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,579
the low

801
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,579
the law of say it's a Royal Decree who

802
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,880
can this can decide how long the

803
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,040
perimeter will be that can be one

804
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,099
kilometer that can be 20 kilometer

805
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,119
that's that makes a great difference

806
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,700
that is in the low not a minimum or a

807
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,040
maximum from the perimeter that they

808
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,200
have to uh to to develop

809
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,839
then that's

810
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,980
all the

811
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,780
the geographic zones then very short

812
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,000
second Point what kind of data Master

813
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,420
operators collect

814
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,940
when you in the discussion can you can

815
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,820
give me an example to see if this is in

816
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,460
the in the data I think that everything

817
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,700
you can think about what operator can

818
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,520
collect is in this data it's more than

819
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,420
40 more than 40 different data that they

820
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,359
have to collect

821
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,000
traffic data General data data about

822
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,140
individual persons in the low the

823
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,540
European law of European court of

824
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,359
justice say you can collect

825
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,140
storage do from

826
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,619
IP addresses and

827
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,800
identification addresses but not not in

828
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,440
fact not fairly much more than that

829
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,839
and when you do this you can do it on

830
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,520
the on the spatial conditions for

831
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,640
instance then that can be a problem to

832
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,880
for the treats against children the

833
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,220
pornography against children and things

834
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
like that they are very

835
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,220
exact conditions in the decisions of the

836
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,780
European Court

837
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,320
and then the third point the first

838
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,420
second what the operators have to

839
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,320
collect

840
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,880
third point is the access

841
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,099
which authorities can have access to the

842
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,480
data from The Operators

843
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,200
I've

844
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,900
I follow I know the first law I know the

845
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,599
secret law and I know the third low in

846
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,240
the first low there were four

847
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,060
authorities who can have access in the

848
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,579
second law there are six authorities who

849
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,320
can have access

850
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,619
I ask you how many

851
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:00,180
authorities or no in the in the third

852
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,260
law

853
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,579
then

854
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,800
different authorities who can have

855
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,140
access on certain conditions okay but

856
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,180
who can potentially have access to

857
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,680
this data uh what's a little bit normal

858
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,720
that are the intelligence and Security

859
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,020
Services

860
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,800
that or the competent

861
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
authorities for software

862
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,180
for yeah

863
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,820
to to follow at least that even of our

864
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,339
judicial authorities competed to prevent

865
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,339
investigative detect prosecute serious

866
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:39,720
crime

867
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,940
okay you can discuss about it

868
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,020
but also

869
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,640
administrative or judicial authorities

870
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,099
competent prevention investigation

871
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,760
detection prosecution criminal offense

872
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,900
not serious crime it's so in the law an

873
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,200
infected the discussion is serious crime

874
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,599
that's the only possibility to to to

875
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,540
collect data to have access to data it's

876
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,780
literally in in the the new Belgian law

877
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,599
that also administrative and judicial

878
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,560
authorities can have access for criminal

879
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,220
offense not serious crime

880
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,020
in some other seven others also

881
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,619
well I can can stop here I will finished

882
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,540
with

883
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,460
uh one citation

884
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,320
of the Belgian

885
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,000
protection authority the Privacy

886
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,640
commission uh

887
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,060
they look to this low and they give an

888
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,940
advice about the project of the law but

889
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,500
between the real law and the project

890
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,099
there was not so many uh

891
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,040
difference

892
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,740
what did the Belgian Authority say

893
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,480
however

894
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,280
and also the Belgian constitutional

895
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,920
Court say that however it should be

896
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,359
noted that the preliminary drafts low

897
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,119
does not really

898
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,780
entail the change of perspective as

899
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,119
acquired by the judicial Dance of the

900
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,520
European court of justice and the

901
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,640
Constitutional Court in its opinion

902
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,240
The Authority notes that the preliminary

903
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,180
draft law intends to impose new measures

904
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,579
for retention of traffic and location

905
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,780
data which could lead to de facto

906
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,680
de facto reintroduction of generalized

907
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,420
and indiscriminate data retention

908
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,240
obligations while at the same time

909
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,060
increasing the possibilities for Access

910
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,079
until search data is further expanded

911
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,940
that I normally when you look at that

912
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,839
you stop it you stop it is slow

913
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,099
and to finished

914
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:05,640
the same Authority it is therefore

915
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,400
crucial to ensure that the draft law

916
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,920
does not reintroduce the uni or de facto

917
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,300
generalized obligation to retain the

918
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,599
traffic or location data of all or to

919
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,760
many of the users of electronic

920
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,980
communications in Belgium I finished

921
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,500
with that because it it gives a very

922
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,839
good summary of what of the problem

923
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,819
who's happened at this moment with the

924
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,040
third law in Belgium thank you

925
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,920
thank you very much this was very good

926
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,920
to hear so we have very clear issues

927
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,020
that we need answers to in terms of what

928
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,240
is serious crime what is the data that

929
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,760
you need to come from can it be targeted

930
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,579
while de facto reinstating Mass

931
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:50,220
surveillance all these would like to

932
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,700
have the audience ask more specific or

933
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,880
in-depth question about so if you have

934
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,579
any feel free to ask them now

935
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,619
um otherwise keep them for later but

936
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,599
happy to have them now

937
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,500
um

938
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,140
you touched also on a couple points that

939
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,839
Patrick I believe will will go into for

940
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,960
example what the the Dynamics are in

941
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,540
terms of of pressure what the direction

942
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,819
taken is

943
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,400
um you mentioned IP addresses being been

944
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,140
retained

945
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,700
Etc

946
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,859
um Patrick I believe you're going to

947
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:28,859
speak about uh

948
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,660
situation in Germany in the space net

949
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,200
case but also uh the Alternatives so I

950
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,060
want to ask you why are we still here

951
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,980
today given there have been so many

952
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,660
cases at the court of justice and other

953
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,540
other courts as well

954
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,220
um has not has everything not been said

955
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,780
why

956
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,780
um is there so much pressure from a

957
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,819
legal but also political point of view

958
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:54,839
since you are both an MEP and a judge

959
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,220
um for this Mass surveillance

960
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,300
in can we say all member states

961
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,960
not quite all but nearly all I'm first

962
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,119
of all happy to be having this panel on

963
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,920
on data retention and that so many of

964
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,900
you are interested in the topic because

965
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,420
it's an old topic but also one where

966
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,460
Civil Society has been really successful

967
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,220
in pushing back against this the court

968
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,380
of justice and null the European um

969
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,720
directive on data retention and really

970
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,060
set red lines to this type of mass

971
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,040
surveillance so

972
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,160
um it is so important that we keep

973
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,359
fighting and defending it and thank you

974
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,940
for all your your work in in doing so

975
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,520
also in Belgium now as to the situation

976
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,980
in Germany

977
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,079
um we also have a history of a First

978
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,880
Data retention law 2009 that was

979
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,040
annulled by the Constitutional Court in

980
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,099
2015 another data retention law came

981
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:52,560
into Force but administrative courts

982
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,140
decided soon after this is in plain

983
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,300
violation of the case law of the

984
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,619
European court of justice and they

985
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:00,599
suspended this law and that's basically

986
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,300
the legal situation we are at in

987
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,040
September of last year as we've heard

988
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,420
the court of justice annulled or

989
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,000
basically declared the German

990
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,480
legislation in violation of fundamental

991
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,800
rights of the EU karda and the main

992
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,040
reason it gave was that this data could

993
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,560
reveal habits of everyday life a

994
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,900
permanent or permanent temporary places

995
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,599
of residence daily or other movements

996
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,240
the activities carried out the social

997
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,940
relationship of those persons and the

998
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,460
social environment frequented by them so

999
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,319
the court understands very well just how

1000
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,500
sensitive this data is is but as has

1001
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,900
been said previously it no longer

1002
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,780
applied these principles to the

1003
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,060
indiscriminate and general retention of

1004
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,280
IP addresses which is a huge problem

1005
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,280
because these IP addresses allow for

1006
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,099
tracing your activity on the Internet

1007
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:01,680
it's like a fingerprints that you are

1008
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,079
leaving on whichever websites you visit

1009
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,020
they usually keep exact logs of your

1010
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,960
activity even if you're not signed in

1011
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,800
they will retain logs of your IP address

1012
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,859
and what exactly you were reading or

1013
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,859
posting online and the fact that this is

1014
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:21,540
being treated differently by the court

1015
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,819
is a huge problem

1016
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,160
the court also allowed for a so-called

1017
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,680
quick freeze procedure which would then

1018
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,339
be used to

1019
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:35,700
preserve data on a case-by-case basis

1020
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,240
that could be needed to prosecute

1021
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,579
serious crime

1022
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:45,540
in Germany then in ensured a fierce

1023
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,980
debate within the government which

1024
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,160
consists of liberals and greens that

1025
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,319
have always opposed General data

1026
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,420
retention but also social Democrats that

1027
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,980
have actually enacted the law that was

1028
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,740
subject to the judicial review

1029
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,960
and so in October of last year the

1030
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,780
German Minister of Justice a liberal

1031
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,119
proposed a law that would replace the

1032
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,680
current data retention regime altogether

1033
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,400
by a quick freeze regime and notably not

1034
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,119
using the opportunity for a general and

1035
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,740
indiscriminate IP retention

1036
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,079
and the quick freeze regime that they

1037
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,540
propose would mean that at the first

1038
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,300
step it would generally require a court

1039
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,000
order or in Urgent cases an order by a

1040
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,579
Judicial Authority the prosecutor to um

1041
00:48:37,579 --> 00:48:41,940
preserve a certain data of specific data

1042
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,240
and in the second phase there would

1043
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,339
another order would be required to

1044
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:48,560
actually access

1045
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,359
the retained data if needed for a

1046
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,020
specific investigation

1047
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,440
and um so um this quick freeze procedure

1048
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,780
which is targeted it is certainly a much

1049
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,940
better alternative because it's a

1050
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,119
case-by-case basis it doesn't uh place a

1051
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,440
general suspicion on the entire

1052
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,720
population so

1053
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,119
um this is the right way to go but I

1054
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,000
think the scope is too wide because the

1055
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,940
proposal doesn't provide clearly

1056
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,480
um how restricted these freeze orders

1057
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,440
would be so it's worded so vaguely that

1058
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,000
you could basically

1059
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,960
um have them very a general and say in

1060
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,900
order to investigate a certain uh

1061
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,380
a suspect we basically need to preserve

1062
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,819
every data because everything could be

1063
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:41,520
relevant and that is a great risk in the

1064
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,380
current wording of The Proposal but

1065
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,339
anyway

1066
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:46,500
um there is a deadlock in in government

1067
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,900
because

1068
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,060
the other side the minister of the

1069
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,880
Interior who is a Social Democrat keeps

1070
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,420
calling for a general retention of Ip

1071
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,619
records of the entire population and

1072
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:01,380
will not agree to anything less

1073
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,720
and what they are mostly arguing with is

1074
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,400
child protection

1075
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,619
however I don't see that a general IP

1076
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,540
data retention would actually improve

1077
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,099
the situation when it comes to

1078
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:17,760
Prosecuting a child sexual exploitation

1079
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,680
and I will provide you with some

1080
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,119
arguments

1081
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,000
first of all we know because of a

1082
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,440
parliamentary question that Germany

1083
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,960
fails to trace only three percent of

1084
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,060
Nike make reports of alleged child

1085
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,140
pornography even so there is no a

1086
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,660
general IP data retention in place at

1087
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,119
current only three percent of reports

1088
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,859
cannot be retraced they are just very

1089
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:43,380
fast and usually they can retrace IP

1090
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,300
addresses within the few days that the

1091
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,300
providers will keep them for business

1092
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,059
purposes anyway

1093
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,619
furthermore

1094
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,240
um

1095
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,200
Germany anyway is able to prosecute more

1096
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,680
than 90 percent of all

1097
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,380
CSM investigations without IPA blanket

1098
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,319
IP data retention being in in force and

1099
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:10,380
also a research by the European

1100
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,940
parliament's research service that I

1101
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,760
commissioned found that throughout the

1102
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,599
European Union there is no statistically

1103
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,359
significant impact on crime or crime

1104
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,940
clearance rates When comparing those

1105
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,400
countries with IP data retention in

1106
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,319
place to those countries that do not

1107
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,680
have as such a regime

1108
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,960
and also we can see that in in EU

1109
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,940
countries that have IP data retention in

1110
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,400
place the crime clearance rate is also

1111
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,440
at present no no higher than in other

1112
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,420
countries so that's why I think that

1113
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,059
there is a lack of evidence that

1114
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,040
um this actually significantly

1115
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,559
contributes to uh Prosecuting this these

1116
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,480
types of crime

1117
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,420
um governments still tend to to push for

1118
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,760
it and we can see at EU level where

1119
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,260
there is indeed a discussion on

1120
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,839
reintroducing a a new European

1121
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,180
instrument on data retention that the

1122
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,680
greatest consensus among National

1123
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,640
governments is on mandating IEP data

1124
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,220
retention which is a great risk because

1125
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,559
basically even in those countries where

1126
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:15,420
the Constitutional courts or the

1127
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,640
parliaments have decided against it they

1128
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,480
would be forced by Union law to

1129
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,700
reintroduce it and that would in the end

1130
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,720
make every online activity traceable

1131
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,280
it would not affect a criminals because

1132
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,440
they can easily hide between

1133
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,700
um anonymization Services

1134
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:40,500
data retention is ineffective for um

1135
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
the

1136
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,940
covert investigations that are needed

1137
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,400
for example to um

1138
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,160
prosecute a child porn rings that

1139
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,500
usually use self-hosted forums and

1140
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
encrypted archives data retention cannot

1141
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,420
be used in that area but it takes very

1142
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,880
targeted investigations

1143
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,940
so what we need to talk about and what

1144
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,220
is what I think is the greatest threat

1145
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,500
to fundamental rights is the lack of

1146
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,740
discussion on real solutions and and

1147
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,200
Alternatives that are not as easy as a

1148
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,020
piece of legislation that Parliament can

1149
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,280
simply decide

1150
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,240
so um what kind of alternatives are

1151
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,220
there if we want to protect children and

1152
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,920
we all want to do that

1153
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,720
um let me just name a few that I've

1154
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,240
noted down here what about an emergency

1155
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,720
number for children or um if somebody

1156
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,760
has knows that some children is in

1157
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,559
danger what about well-equipped

1158
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,900
counseling centers they keep complaining

1159
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,160
that

1160
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,720
um they are suffering from a lack of

1161
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,880
funding what about Anonymous content

1162
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,380
contact points also for perpetrators who

1163
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,500
seek help there is therapy on offer but

1164
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,460
not enough places for

1165
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,740
pedophiles who want to receive therapy

1166
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,880
what about public education campaigns

1167
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,319
mandatory child protection programs in

1168
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,960
schools sport clubs churches all these

1169
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,880
are places where child sexual abuse

1170
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,300
often typically it takes place

1171
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,480
trained Child Protection officers

1172
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,000
police units that are specialized and

1173
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,880
and trained in in processing this uh

1174
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,160
these crimes if you distribute the

1175
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,059
prosecution to local police offices they

1176
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,119
often don't know how to deal with it

1177
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:31,559
professionally they don't know how to

1178
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,839
identify victims they don't know what to

1179
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:34,940
prioritize

1180
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,440
that is a problem we are seeing with law

1181
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,119
enforcement at present

1182
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,180
what about online police patrols or

1183
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,359
login traps that will be able to

1184
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,140
um

1185
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,660
preserve the IP address of a suspect the

1186
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,540
next time they log in that usually works

1187
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,640
for services that require a login

1188
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,839
without IP data retention in place so

1189
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,760
there are so many Alternatives that need

1190
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,440
to be thought of and that would be so

1191
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,500
much more effective but not as easy to

1192
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,440
to put in place so we certainly need

1193
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,900
more dialogue between Child Protection

1194
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,960
experts and fundamental rights experts

1195
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,700
and um

1196
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,380
we need to learn from

1197
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,079
experiences such as the horrific case in

1198
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,079
Germany in ludica where children

1199
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,260
suffered 20 years of abuse and the

1200
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,280
report on this actually concluded that

1201
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,260
this was due to a failure of authorities

1202
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,319
and a lack of Investigations and the

1203
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:40,020
same is the case often when it comes to

1204
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,859
abuse within Church authorities no more

1205
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,200
surveillance is needed for that

1206
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,079
so let me get close with um two uh

1207
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:53,400
remarks the first is a very recent and

1208
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,500
pending case on daily retention we still

1209
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,880
have with the European code of justice

1210
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,200
is the hadoopy case which is about what

1211
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,740
are the conditions for accessing IP data

1212
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,260
retention the code of justice said you

1213
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,760
couldn't retain it indiscriminately but

1214
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,380
you can use it only for prosecuting

1215
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,900
serious crime and now The Advocate

1216
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,760
General in this Adobe case actually

1217
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,819
proposes to drop this requirement and

1218
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:21,359
allow to access your generally retained

1219
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,520
IP addresses even for prosecuting any

1220
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,280
crime including copyright

1221
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,720
a law which is of course a huge

1222
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,960
expansion of of purposes and would

1223
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,780
result in many more accesses to to

1224
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,760
retrace your internet activity

1225
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,119
and finally a remark on what Ralph

1226
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,180
described and how the governments deal

1227
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,940
with this case law and Belgium is just

1228
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,940
one example of many a similar ones we

1229
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,339
really have a crisis of the rule of law

1230
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:54,800
in the EU if you see how they deal with

1231
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,420
this case law on data retention how they

1232
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,359
show contempt for it and how they try to

1233
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,640
circumvent it to to use all sorts of

1234
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,920
Tricks but sometimes openly disregarded

1235
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,680
or even make laws that are worse than

1236
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,980
the ones that have been annulled and the

1237
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,780
governments even put pressure on the

1238
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,140
courts as as you described it to some

1239
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,599
effect actually the court starts to

1240
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:20,339
introduce exceptions

1241
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,260
but the EU commission is completely

1242
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,420
standing idly by it would be their job

1243
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,200
to enforce the case law on the Privacy

1244
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,359
directive and not a single enforcement

1245
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,680
procedure has been brought forward

1246
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,200
because the response of a commissioner

1247
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,180
interior commissioner Johansson is

1248
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,440
herself in favor of data retention and

1249
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,720
so this is really a crisis of the the

1250
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,780
rule of law the EU keeps

1251
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,280
saying that Hungary and Poland have

1252
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,280
problems there but in fact when it comes

1253
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,740
to data retention this is a crisis

1254
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,140
nearly throughout the EU where

1255
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,240
governments are not willing to to follow

1256
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,220
the rulings and to protect our

1257
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,859
fundamental rights and that's why it's

1258
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,800
important that we stand up for our

1259
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,680
fundamental rights that we reject any

1260
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,540
kind of of General data retention which

1261
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,760
would affect

1262
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,460
450 million EU citizens place them under

1263
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,280
a generous suspicion massive violence is

1264
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,380
the opposite of what European values

1265
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,619
embody and you already mentioned the

1266
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:26,940
Democratic Society what does it take to

1267
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,020
have a Democratic Society and the the

1268
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,059
threat we are seeing is the ignorance

1269
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,460
for finding real solutions we need to

1270
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,220
work on Alternatives and we need to

1271
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,619
engage experts in in doing that and

1272
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,099
that's the positive outlook that I have

1273
00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:46,140
that it is possible and we have an

1274
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,559
opportunity to convince the policy

1275
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,500
makers of of better approaches

1276
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,760
thank you Patrick thank you very much

1277
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,880
this is at the same time Bleak and also

1278
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,920
optimistic

1279
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,740
um I mean hopeful looking

1280
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,460
um

1281
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,960
what's really good is that you provide

1282
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,440
Alternatives I I think in that you don't

1283
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,660
come with just we don't want this

1284
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,220
therefore it's out and we don't want

1285
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,260
discussion even

1286
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,319
um

1287
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,960
does the urgents have ideas about other

1288
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,099
Alternatives that have not been

1289
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,440
mentioned for example or before we move

1290
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,260
on to specific questions other than this

1291
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,839
is anyone aware of Alternatives that

1292
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,940
have that exist and have not been put on

1293
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,140
the table

1294
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,200
um

1295
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:42,200
if not we'll move on to the questions

1296
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,220
I think this is there was a question

1297
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,879
from online

1298
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,040
just from Twitter uh Nicholas

1299
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,440
um was if

1300
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,960
um panelists can address what is the

1301
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,619
role of aeropol to gather and process

1302
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:07,859
personal or like a communication data

1303
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:10,500
that's the question

1304
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,940
can you keep the microphone and give it

1305
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,380
to anyone who has questions following

1306
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,599
this in the meantime while we answer

1307
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,520
this question you may think of your own

1308
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,319
questions if you have any doubts or any

1309
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,780
Clarity who wants to take this question

1310
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,819
on the role of oral Paul in gathering

1311
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:26,119
data

1312
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,359
yes um maybe just a quick information

1313
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,359
for the first part europol stores all

1314
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,099
the data that they receive from member

1315
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,980
states so it turns out and there is a

1316
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,660
procedure with pending with the European

1317
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,760
data protection supervisor that they are

1318
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,000
storing masses of data and also bulk

1319
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,540
data on millions of citizens

1320
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,220
um

1321
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,319
um uh which the European data protection

1322
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,660
supervisor says is illegal but europol

1323
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,859
refuses to um to delete and they have

1324
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:01,380
now gone to court against the revised

1325
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,319
europol regulation and mandate which

1326
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,200
seeks to legalize this bulk storage of

1327
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,799
data on on citizens some have said that

1328
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,680
what your poly stirring goes beyond what

1329
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,500
the NSA is storing and this is really

1330
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,200
worrying and for the other part with the

1331
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,780
new europele reform europol has received

1332
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:26,700
the power to directly request data from

1333
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,700
private companies so they can ask for

1334
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,200
data however the companies are not

1335
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,640
required to hand it over and maybe data

1336
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,920
Privacy Law May prevent them from

1337
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,980
serving those requests we don't know at

1338
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,619
this time how often they use these new

1339
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,079
powers we don't know whether companies

1340
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,299
will agree to handing over data but

1341
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:54,660
there is a mandate

1342
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:55,920
thank you Patrick

1343
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,720
is there any other question right now

1344
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,220
otherwise

1345
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,200
we I may have questions for the pendants

1346
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,299
myself or I may allow them to go into

1347
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:05,339
greater depths about things that have

1348
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:07,380
been mentioned in that would benefit

1349
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,480
from having more details I'll give you

1350
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,240
30 seconds without saying anything so

1351
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,740
that the

1352
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,420
those of you who are brave enough can

1353
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,440
raise their hand

1354
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,799
oh

1355
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,160
hi Patrick Williams

1356
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,540
um from Manchester United University

1357
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,740
um everyone on the panels made reference

1358
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,440
to the problem of crime definitions of

1359
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,359
crime and I think the final point you

1360
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,099
were making Patrick around the fact that

1361
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,099
the vast majority of child abuse will

1362
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,799
take place in the home and in the family

1363
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,559
means that any response to it is not

1364
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,660
really going to get to those issues so

1365
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,460
I'm wanting to what extent that could be

1366
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,460
a valuable lens strategy through which

1367
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,319
the transist worked

1368
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,440
um Arguments for Mass potential given

1369
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,240
that crime in and of itself is really

1370
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,880
problematic and vague and it's an

1371
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,880
absolute an objective fact of reality

1372
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,500
I think this question was directed to

1373
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,020
all of you equally but

1374
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,599
if I'm not wrong so if anyone wants to

1375
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,200
take it

1376
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,559
interesting lands and we do have a

1377
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:21,299
problem of definitions because for

1378
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,799
instance serious crime is not actually

1379
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,260
defined in the EU when we have a lot of

1380
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,180
different instruments

1381
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,859
um having their own definitions which

1382
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:31,680
might depend on how many years of

1383
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,680
imprisonment is at risk and I have also

1384
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:37,559
seen an Empirical research on what

1385
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,480
actually the citizens consider to be

1386
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,819
serious crimes might not correspond to

1387
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:43,980
what they you thinks it's serious crime

1388
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,099
so uh for sure I I completely agree with

1389
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:49,559
you that the lens of looking into the

1390
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,240
causes of crime the social and

1391
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,819
socioeconomical causes of crime and how

1392
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:57,660
can we address them in the roots rather

1393
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,059
than this Mass data surveillance

1394
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:02,400
instruments but we can see that this is

1395
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,720
not happening also with new technologies

1396
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,460
which are being developed or under

1397
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,400
development and whereby it's more about

1398
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,859
looking for patterns of suspicious

1399
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,319
behavior that actual doesn't have any

1400
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,559
causal link to the the sources of crime

1401
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:23,099
but only looks into correlations between

1402
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:27,000
types of behaviors and criminal acts

1403
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,020
um so yes I think we should refocus

1404
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,880
precisely as you mentioned what what are

1405
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,799
we looking for exactly and what do we

1406
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,180
want to solve

1407
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,960
thank you

1408
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:43,279
I understand your question

1409
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,480
this question about what scribe about

1410
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,140
serious crime and and what can you do

1411
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,900
against that and what's the

1412
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,420
um what can you do with this kind of

1413
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,859
flows again serious crime

1414
01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:01,140
in the Belgian in low also in the third

1415
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,900
low they

1416
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,200
give a reference to what so is so-called

1417
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
as serious crime that or

1418
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,020
43 crimes for who the the the

1419
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,680
not the prosecuted

1420
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,680
okay the special person who can do these

1421
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,260
kind of interventions

1422
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:30,079
is competence but that's a list of 43

1423
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,220
crimes in who are not really serious

1424
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:37,260
crimes serious crimes what is that the

1425
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,680
terrorism

1426
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:44,299
and things like that that can be that or

1427
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:47,640
things about against children and and

1428
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,520
things that that means my opposite my

1429
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,559
position is that when you make these

1430
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,680
kind of laws you have to give your own

1431
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,859
definition of

1432
01:05:57,859 --> 01:06:00,660
serious crimes they don't do that they

1433
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,960
make reference to

1434
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,200
General position in the Belgian criminal

1435
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,079
law

1436
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:11,960
second point

1437
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,599
in in Patrick knows it better than me

1438
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,900
they make a report to see if this kind

1439
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,040
of laws have any influence in the

1440
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,039
solution of crimes you you can give

1441
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:27,740
better the answer but

1442
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:32,760
mostly it's not any proof about that and

1443
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,260
in Belgium there was the the president

1444
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:39,380
of the the high court in Antwerp Antwerp

1445
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,319
who make his Mercurial that is the

1446
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,059
speech he gave by the beginning of the

1447
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,000
year the geological year and he speak

1448
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,099
also about these kind of laws and you

1449
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:52,859
say what's the experience in Belgium

1450
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,720
about the payload that there was a law

1451
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,180
and there was not a law because the

1452
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,520
first law was working

1453
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,059
annulated period of Nolo Second Law

1454
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,880
working period of no law and so on he

1455
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,539
said what did you have any proof that in

1456
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:15,299
this period the the it was a element to

1457
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:18,119
give solutions to the crimes

1458
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:20,520
and his conclusion is there is not any

1459
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,220
statistic not any statistic in Belgium

1460
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,640
they don't know it and that that's the

1461
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,319
that's not serious when you have these

1462
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,539
discussions in the Parliament that are

1463
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:32,940
things that you have to know you you

1464
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,599
know you must know objective elements to

1465
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,020
uh to to make this kind of uh

1466
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,859
definitions third and last point

1467
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,559
that is a problem

1468
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,480
you you may be in Belgium of the sky

1469
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,339
question maybe I don't know if you know

1470
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:54,619
the sky

1471
01:07:54,619 --> 01:08:01,280
uh question but in in France they

1472
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,859
they find the description of the sky

1473
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:06,119
telephones

1474
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:09,140
and uh

1475
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,319
where at this moment I think based on

1476
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:16,560
the description what's in the sky sky

1477
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,219
telephones were used by

1478
01:08:19,219 --> 01:08:23,179
criminals in the direct traffic scene

1479
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:26,040
and at this moment there are in the

1480
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,279
prison in Antwerp about 150 people who

1481
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,520
were imprisoned based on that kind of

1482
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,738
description

1483
01:08:34,738 --> 01:08:37,319
okay it's a discussion

1484
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:38,399
because

1485
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,219
the lawyers who have to defend these

1486
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:43,439
Case by the tribunals they say yeah but

1487
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:45,238
there is a problem with the Belgium data

1488
01:08:45,238 --> 01:08:49,439
Belgian uh with the a privacy uh

1489
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,020
directive and so on but the Belgian

1490
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,759
courts reject this opposition but okay

1491
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:02,880
in this kind of uh files you see that it

1492
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,620
can bring some

1493
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,979
elements to the to solution of the

1494
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:11,339
crimes that's all what I say about it

1495
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:13,380
Patrick do you want to add something on

1496
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,120
this question of serious crime perhaps

1497
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,520
on the question of should we have an EU

1498
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,339
wide notion of the EU crime

1499
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:22,198
um

1500
01:09:22,198 --> 01:09:25,500
perhaps because I I hear that in the I

1501
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,020
think media Freedom actors there might

1502
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,060
be a mention in the council documents of

1503
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,799
what a serious crime is

1504
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:33,839
regardless of where whether there is or

1505
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,839
not is it something that we should look

1506
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,019
into

1507
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,580
I'm afraid that if we had an EU

1508
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,198
definition they would use that as an

1509
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,060
opportunity to introduce data retention

1510
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,698
and also every member state would add

1511
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:49,979
their crimes to it and we would end up

1512
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:51,600
with a catalog that's even larger than

1513
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,540
43 types of crime so I can't say I

1514
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,780
support that but I fully agree with what

1515
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,900
Ralph said on

1516
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,480
um if the the court says you can do data

1517
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,820
retention for National Security you can

1518
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:08,820
do data retention to to target areas of

1519
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,739
of you know specific risks then I wonder

1520
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:16,860
what about any evidence that data

1521
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,080
retention specifically is strictly

1522
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,820
necessary to prevent threats to National

1523
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,179
Security to prevent terrorist attacks to

1524
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:30,480
protect the court buildings and the

1525
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,880
European Parliament has retained data

1526
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,020
ever been needed for these purposes so

1527
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,260
they just set out purposes but they they

1528
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,920
don't specifically

1529
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,020
request

1530
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:48,239
evidence that this is strictly necessary

1531
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,800
to attain those aims and I can only say

1532
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,840
that when it comes to France they have a

1533
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,880
general data retention regime just in

1534
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,040
Belgium based on a permanent threat to

1535
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,860
National Security but they had data

1536
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,679
retention in place when any of the

1537
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:06,300
terrorist attacks that happened in

1538
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,760
France had happened and I've not heard a

1539
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,820
single case where this would have helped

1540
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,880
to prevent these attacks so I don't see

1541
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,520
the evidence that data retention is

1542
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,140
actually a useful tool to counter these

1543
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,179
threats and that's something which I

1544
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,580
think the case law and the court needs

1545
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,580
to look into more because a general

1546
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,100
requirement of proportionality is always

1547
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,940
is something strictly necessary to

1548
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:41,059
attain the the aim that you aim for

1549
01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:44,340
that was always a discussion is it

1550
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,040
necessary in a Democratic Society

1551
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,060
the the European court of justice

1552
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,980
also was confronted with this discussion

1553
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:59,300
and they say in

1554
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:04,320
the space net judgment

1555
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,080
article

1556
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,080
96.

1557
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,020
because that was also an argument in

1558
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,360
Belgium the the prosecutors and so on

1559
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,120
they say yeah we need it for a criminal

1560
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,560
to to to to fight against the serious

1561
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,900
crime

1562
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:28,140
the court say in the European culture in

1563
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,020
that regard it must be observed in the

1564
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,860
first place that the effectiveness

1565
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:36,980
effectiveness of criminal proceedings

1566
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:42,140
generally depends not on a single means

1567
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,840
not on a single means of Investigation

1568
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,080
but on all means of Investigation

1569
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,880
available to the competent National

1570
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,300
authorities for those purpose that means

1571
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,400
they have also in Belgium at all in all

1572
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,460
the countries they have other means to

1573
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,760
to to do the persecution of crime but

1574
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,140
okay it it's a discussion

1575
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,239
thank you very much we are reaching the

1576
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:11,580
end of the panel so if anyone has a

1577
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,800
question pending ask it now otherwise

1578
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,560
we'll move on with concluding remarks

1579
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,760
I'll give you 10 seconds

1580
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,260
we move on therefore closing remarks

1581
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,080
um I think the message that this this

1582
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,480
panel gives is that uh

1583
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:42,239
it's intended for for civil study but

1584
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,699
also for commission and governments is

1585
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:48,420
that we are critical of what's being

1586
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,460
made of the steps that are being taken

1587
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,219
we are aware of what is being made and

1588
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:54,540
taken

1589
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,520
um and that we are not tired we're not

1590
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,580
we're going to fight this fight I I hear

1591
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,679
that you were going to appeal the

1592
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:03,659
Belgian proposal

1593
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:05,280
um

1594
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,760
therefore I want you to conclude and

1595
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,460
reflect on perhaps what

1596
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,239
um

1597
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,159
what is uh worse

1598
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,840
the the impacts of crime when we don't

1599
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,600
have data retention if it were effective

1600
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,219
or the impact of having an old again and

1601
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,800
again the data region sorry the data

1602
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,020
retention loss so what is worse having

1603
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,719
crime that is not tackled through data

1604
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,060
retention or having crime that

1605
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,040
was supposed to be tackled but because

1606
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,219
we I know the data retention laws over

1607
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:44,640
and over they are not able to be pursued

1608
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,739
in court if we have to cancel these uh

1609
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:51,360
these Skype cases for example

1610
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,360
um and what is the most important

1611
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,300
threats also in the forthcoming years in

1612
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,140
terms of data retention

1613
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,140
thank you

1614
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,719
um I agree with everything already said

1615
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,520
that we don't really have any

1616
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,260
information as to whether crime is

1617
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,380
actually not being solved when we don't

1618
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,199
have data retention or it's more solved

1619
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:19,080
when we do have data retention schemes

1620
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,820
and let's not forget the data are

1621
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,860
retained for business purposes in any

1622
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:26,460
case for a few for a period of time so

1623
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,080
it's not like data are immediately gone

1624
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,239
forever

1625
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,640
um so with regards to the to the first

1626
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,560
part I think we have already established

1627
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,719
we definitely need a lot more uh

1628
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:39,300
empirical information on what types of

1629
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,179
data are actually necessary and

1630
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:44,340
effective in contributing to specific

1631
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,100
types of crimes

1632
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,159
um with regards to the Future looking

1633
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,900
ahead

1634
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,719
um yes as I mentioned I think that this

1635
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:57,199
should be more specifically regulated

1636
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,000
because the court of justice is also

1637
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,239
Bound by the preliminary questions every

1638
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:06,000
time it keeps on repeating it's a case

1639
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,679
law it keeps on

1640
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:08,640
um

1641
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,520
being restricted in specific areas and

1642
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,920
I'm not sure we can go much further only

1643
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,580
with case law and knowing that the data

1644
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,920
retention directive was annulled perhaps

1645
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,219
a new legislative initiative would be a

1646
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:24,900
lot more careful in the impact

1647
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,199
assessment that it it's mandated to have

1648
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:31,620
in order to pass so that would be my

1649
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,159
suggestion or thought for the future

1650
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,879
yep

1651
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,980
when they invite us for this

1652
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,860
discussion they say can you prepare what

1653
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,460
challenges you see for the future

1654
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,640
I have two challenges first

1655
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,340
that we've in the case against the third

1656
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,320
Belgian law

1657
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,580
because

1658
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:03,239
you can discuss many things but it's a

1659
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:06,300
Concrete question to to stop these kind

1660
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,060
of flows and it's not an even not

1661
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,940
evident to win it but that's the first

1662
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,400
point we will do everything for that but

1663
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,840
it's not along the lodge who have to to

1664
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,600
to

1665
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,140
do their work but I think the everyone

1666
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,080
who is interested in privacy and

1667
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,000
democracy must support these kind of

1668
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,179
procedures because we know that also a

1669
01:17:36,179 --> 01:17:38,159
little bit of pressure of outside on the

1670
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,960
on the courts can be a little help

1671
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,739
for this kind of procedures that's the

1672
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:48,360
first point in

1673
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,580
also what we need for the league for

1674
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,940
human rights is money we have not so

1675
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,940
much money to do this kind of of

1676
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,640
procedures that it should be very good

1677
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,219
when there is a European funds for that

1678
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,040
in which we can collect money and I

1679
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,840
think they're all in in Belgium but also

1680
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,940
in Europe many people who want to give

1681
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:13,280
100 euro for for this kind of of

1682
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,860
procedures and this kind of fight

1683
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:21,120
that's my first wish

1684
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:25,460
and a second wish is that

1685
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,040
I write my book book big broadly in

1686
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,199
Europe in 2010

1687
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:35,219
and then I say uh at that moment climate

1688
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:37,020
change was coming up

1689
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,260
but I also and it's very important

1690
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,840
but I also say private change is coming

1691
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,659
up but you don't see it you don't feel

1692
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:47,940
it you don't you feel it only when there

1693
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,239
are accidents and and things like that

1694
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:54,780
that and it's not easy to make to make a

1695
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:59,100
popular item from privacy I know it it's

1696
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,640
a it's not like climate you feel it when

1697
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,520
the rain is coming to Merchant so on but

1698
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,600
for privacy it's it's another uh it's

1699
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,880
like Atomic that you don't feel it's

1700
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,000
it's that problem that means that I it

1701
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,380
should be good when they're on on

1702
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,080
European level

1703
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:22,020
there's some coordination collaboration

1704
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,460
between all the people who are

1705
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:28,620
involved in this kind of of discussions

1706
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,920
and this kind of struggle we I think we

1707
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,739
must need a kind of European there are

1708
01:19:34,739 --> 01:19:40,080
many uh different uh Society ngos who

1709
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,100
who make these kind of things

1710
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,060
in France and and others that

1711
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,800
and maybe that's that stood to you that

1712
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,020
I I

1713
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:55,560
do this demand to try to coordinate on

1714
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,260
the European level the struggle to

1715
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,280
defend privacy because there is climate

1716
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,520
change but there is also private change

1717
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,140
and we have to do with all the the

1718
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,380
people who who are concerned about that

1719
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,260
we have to do something it's really what

1720
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,540
you say it's linked also with the the

1721
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,820
time period the

1722
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,060
the rule of flow is not only in this

1723
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:23,100
question that the rule of law is under

1724
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,580
pressure it's in many other discussions

1725
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,060
that we applied not only not only on the

1726
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,860
Belgian level but also on the European

1727
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,620
level also the the court in uh sales

1728
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,719
board the the order on the pressure and

1729
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,620
we from from police politicians who say

1730
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:47,219
we reject the judgments of the of the

1731
01:20:47,219 --> 01:20:49,920
higher courts okay that's my second wish

1732
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,860
to to the European uh struggle for the

1733
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:58,560
Privacy I think you have I can give your

1734
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,719
microphone to Patrick sorry this is the

1735
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,280
fourth one even if you want to raise

1736
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,159
funds rough I'm happy to support and

1737
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:08,580
also redistribute the call for funding

1738
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,940
um as for the how does it affect crime

1739
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,820
I'm not I don't have a bad conscience in

1740
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,620
fighting data retention because I know

1741
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,679
that the crime clearance rate is not

1742
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,480
influenced by whether there is a data

1743
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,820
regime in place or not we can witness it

1744
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,800
in Germany that there was no effect

1745
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,020
whatsoever when the law was no longer

1746
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,239
applied and so I'm not worried at all

1747
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,460
certainly there will be one case or the

1748
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,080
other that investigators can

1749
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,480
specifically point to here it would have

1750
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,940
helped us here it may have prevented an

1751
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,460
investigation but there are also a

1752
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,199
counterproductive effects of data

1753
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,360
retention for example many more people

1754
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,520
use anonymization service if there is a

1755
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,800
data retention scheme in place that is

1756
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,940
what polls have found in Germany and so

1757
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:56,880
it can actually be harmful to criminal

1758
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,260
investigations and basically push crime

1759
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,300
to places that cannot be investigated

1760
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:06,840
even in a in a targeted manner and

1761
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,520
finally when it comes to the Future and

1762
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,980
the Outlook I just want to say that if

1763
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:13,260
ever the EU commission considers to

1764
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,719
propose legislation to bring back data

1765
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:18,480
retention at EU level they can meet the

1766
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,659
fierce fiercest resistance of the

1767
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:23,940
European Parliament as can already be

1768
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,980
witnessed in the current discussions on

1769
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,020
the Privacy regulation where council is

1770
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,420
trying to bring in data retention we are

1771
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,219
totally refusing that and would rather

1772
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:35,040
give up the entire legislation than

1773
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,440
agree to that and so I can only warn the

1774
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,679
commission not to to try to bring this

1775
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:42,900
instrument back be it with regard to IP

1776
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,140
addresses or otherwise they've totally

1777
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,820
failed in court with the data retention

1778
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,640
directive and we should find

1779
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,440
alternatives

1780
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,400
thank you all these powerful words let's

1781
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,500
close the panel thank you very much for

1782
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,800
your attention
