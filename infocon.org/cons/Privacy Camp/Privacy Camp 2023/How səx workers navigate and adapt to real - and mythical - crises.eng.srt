23
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,800
speakers sex soccer rights activist and

24

a researcher as well who will join us

25
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,300
online I will present them briefly I

26
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,800
just wanted to set up the scene a bit

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,019
before before we get into it

28
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,659
first of all thank you so much to enri

29
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,000
for having us here it's really exciting

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,980
it's the first time I think that we have

31
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,799
a whole panel on sex work at privacy

32
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,840
camp and it's a very important issue for

33
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,860
us and hopefully for you as well hmm

34
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,459
so uh as well as I was mentioning is a

35
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,620
sex worker LED Network we have the

36
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,540
various priorities including access to

37
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,120
health access to Justice racial Justice

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,580
labor rights decriminalization of sex

39
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,500
work and more recently we started to

40
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,780
focus as well on digital rights so we

41
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,980
know that the digital rise of sex

42
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,379
workers are critical issues which is

43
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,500
which are often overlooked by policy

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,480
makers and sometimes by other activists

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,519
as well and so when we try to put this

46
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,220
panel together we discuss of a title I

47
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,720
know when you try to put a session

48
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,880
together the title is the worst part and

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,260
you just leave it to the last minute and

50
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,520
you can't find it and it's two minutes

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,139
before the deadline and you're like okay

52
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,000
let's find something very clever and so

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,660
we were like oh in the eye of the storm

54
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,180
critical crisis mythical crisis and then

55
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,680
later we realized the eye of the storm

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,020
is usually the most quiet space of the

57
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,180
storm so our metaphor is a little bit

58
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,040
limited but actually if you look at us

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,620
and how calm we are maybe it does make

60
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,520
sense

61
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,220
so what we meant by the title is that

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,280
you know if you look at uh decades and

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,080
Decades of like policies and laws

64
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,419
affecting prostitution or sex work as we

65
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,060
prefer to use it the issue is that sex

66
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,919
work has always been conflated with

67
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,139
another issue which we call trafficking

68
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,000
in human being and so I want to just

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,520
before I give the the panel uh panelist

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
Mike I want to take you back to a

71
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,060
hundred years ago in 1910 where actually

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,460
the League of Nations came up with the

73
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,780
first International one of the first

74
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,759
International treaty and I don't know if

75
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,440
you know this but one of the first

76
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,080
International treaty was actually

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,759
developed by the United Nations so the

78
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,800
league of nation at the time to tackle

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,539
what was the biggest issue at the time

80
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,860
which was

81
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,539
I don't know if you know maybe somebody

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,419
know what was the first treaty white

83
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,520
slavery so

84
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,979
the issue was that it was so critical to

85
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,960
address the issue of white slavery that

86
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,220
we had to have all this nation come

87
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,199
together and create internationally

88
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,940
binding treaties in order to address

89
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,100
this problem and by wise slavery what

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,199
was actually meant was prostitution and

91
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,580
so when we look at the issue of

92
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,199
trafficking and the way it's been framed

93
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,880
internationally it's always been an

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,759
issue about uh you know controlling

95
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,620
prostitution and controlling migration

96
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,419
in particular and it has from the

97
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,759
beginning extremely racist underturned

98
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,800
if not completely overtly racist

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,139
overturned so if you look in the U.S in

100
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,539
particular like man Act was also a law

101
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,820
that was developed in 1910 the same year

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,220
in order to address prostitution but

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,780
this law was mostly used against black

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,139
men to arrest them in order to like

105
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,759
under the guise of like protecting white

106
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,220
women from prostitution so from the very

107
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,020
beginning of the development of laws on

108
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,419
trafficking sex workers sex work and

109
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,340
trafficking has been conflated and a

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,160
hundred years later 2022 what we see now

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
whether it's at the Council of Europe

112
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,060
the U.N level the European Parliament

113
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,620
this conflation of prostitution and

114
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,600
traffic can continue to be affecting sex

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
workers and this is what we're going to

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,560
talk about today as well as other issues

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,380
affecting sex workers

118
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,840

119
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,919

like how digital Technologies are

164
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
critical for sex workers and how our

165
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,740
access to these Technologies is

166
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,360
prevented and how this impacts our

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,580

explain this I'm going to use the covid

169
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,940
crisis and how sex worker experience

170
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,279
this Health crisis as an example and

171
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,360
lastly I'm going to talk about certain

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
situations and the crisis rhetoric can

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
be used to attack sex workers rights as

174
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,019
we've been experiencing years for years

175
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,160
now

176
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,260
and and if we look at how human

177
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,000
trafficking is used as an excuse to

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,040
criminalize sex workers and to cut their

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,740
access to critical digital tools

180
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,839
so as many of you know the covet crisis

181
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,580
certainly pushed

182
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,240
um

183
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,459
many companies to accelerate to be

184
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,800
digitalized and it made us realize that

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
it is crucial to have access to digital

186
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,580
Technologies in this time

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,140
I don't think anybody really could have

188
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,760
predicted what was going to happen

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,320
but one thing that became clear with the

190
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
covet crisis is that the general

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,820
population and sex workers both had a

192
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,700
great need for digital Technologies

193
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,740
um it pushed sex workers to limits where

194
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,060
we had to look for new ways of working

195
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,680
because

196
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,940
um it was especially noted where there

197
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,700
was harsh lockdowns where they shut down

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,399
brothels and clubs saunas massage

199
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,620
parlors etc etc

200
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,000
so we couldn't leave our houses and we

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,339
had to go somewhere else

202
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,100
many sex workers found I mean also does

203
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,019
this work yeah

204
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:49,920
all right

205
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,899
many of us found that

206
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,680
um

207
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,420
that we had to find another way to find

208
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,120
income so a lot of us turned online so

209
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
big platforms like uh many vids and only

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,240
fans received a big influx of of new

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,740
people trying to find work as well not

212
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,480
just sex workers a lot of people that

213
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,459
lost their jobs during the pandemic also

214
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:11,279
were able to rely on sex work to help

215
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,800
pay bills because we weren't

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,600
um it was a kind of unprecedented times

217
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
we didn't know what to do

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
um and things so thanks to digital

219
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,060
technology sex workers had access to

220
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,459
tools and were able to you know sell a

221
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,279
lot of content or do shows or chat with

222
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,740
their clients and it was such a Lifeline

223
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,060
for most of us

224
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,320
so

225
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
um after I mean not after still during

226
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,980
covet we realized a lot of our work

227
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,260
could be digitalized and a lot of sex

228
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,420
workers are now being drawn even more to

229
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,120
digital Technologies than before

230
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,459
um there are some pros to digitally

231
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,220
mediated sex work the first and foremost

232
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,100
being less encounters with the police as

233
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,480
you probably know sex workers have

234
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,100
reported direct violence at the abuse to

235
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,200
the hands of police officers harassment

236
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,680
intimidation humiliation extortion

237
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,779
um just general physical and sexual

238
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:01,980
violence

239
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,480
and

240
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,339
um further criminalization also of their

241
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,740
jobs arrests or accusations for other

242
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,519
offenses so having

243
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
um kind of like a layer the internet

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,140
between us and the police I mean they're

245
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,000
still there obviously criminalizing us

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,320
but we didn't have to see them in person

247
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,339
was

248
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,640
um helped lower levels of violence

249
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,160
also another Pro about working online is

250
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,220
it was efficient and helped us save time

251
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,660
sex workers could work from our home a

252
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,820
place that we knew a safer environment

253
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,880
one that was familiar to us

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,040
um it also helped us have safer sex by

255
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,100
only having digital contact with clients

256
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,200
um helped us connect online with other

257
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
communities of sex workers have

258
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,100
conversations about important safety

259
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,480
concerns such as warning other sex

260
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,220
workers about potentially dangerous

261
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,860
johns or time wasters

262
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,079
sorry time wasting time wasters are the

263
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,220
worst

264
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,060
um

265
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,459
any other sex worker will agree with me

266
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,959
um it gave us a space to screen for

267
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,399
clients if you don't know what screening

268
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,260
is it's basically you know just asking

269
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,880
clients a few questions so you can have

270
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,220
like kind of like a digital Trail

271
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,380
um maybe their ID have their phone

272
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,899
number or their address or whatever this

273
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,100
is kind of hard to do in person while

274
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,540
doing street-based sex work it's not

275
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,180
impossible but it's harder to do

276
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,800
um also online it gave us a place where

277
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,899
we can advertise our services and just

278
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,360
put our policies which saves us time

279
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,779
instead of like having to tell everybody

280
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,540
you know it's just there on the internet

281
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,920
um and then working online gives us a

282
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,660
possibility to increase income and then

283
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,860
also allows us to have Community with

284
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,140
other sex workers so having spaces to

285
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,820
connect and then the problems with

286
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,200
digital

287
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,839
um Digital Sex work in my own personal

288
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:43,980
experience I'm just going to mention two

289
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,680
short ones Financial discrimination

290
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,100
uh we must rely on financial services to

291
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,779
get paid for our work

292
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,760
um so to do that we must abide by the

293
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,399
TOs in terms of service that are always

294
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,040
almost sex worker discriminatory so it

295
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,839
presents a problem if we can't use our

296
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,019
also it presents a problem by giving our

297
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,480
uh really private information out we

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,940
have to like you know

299
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,500
um use our real names to open up

300
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
accounts

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,540
um and it kind of puts us in a in a a

302
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,100
very difficult position

303
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,920
um big platforms like PayPal for example

304
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,660
are super discriminatory against sex

305
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,200
workers and um I'll go a little bit more

306
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,060
into detail that after and then online

307
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,820
censorship my favorite

308
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,740
I I know for those of you know that I

309
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,500
have been censored on all every single

310
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,139
platform even Tinder so

311
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,660
they censored me there too um no but

312
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,120
they censor me everywhere so like um

313
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,459
but censorship was a is a really big

314
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,500
barrier to sex work and it's also kind

315
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,560
of a confusing a confusing barrier

316
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,600
because of the algorithms that I I

317
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,980
personally don't understand how they

318
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,839
work I just know that they're very

319
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,540
racist and that they go after

320
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,940
marginalized identities for our own good

321
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,620
according to Big platforms like Tick

322
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,019
Tock and Facebook that openly admitted

323
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,360
to censoring bypoc

324
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,700
not too long ago the main problem though

325
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,980
being censored uh it seems like a silly

326
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,060
I mean

327
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,920
lots of people when I've complained

328
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
about censored being censored people

329
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,040
thought it like kind of gaslit means

330
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,600
like that's not that big of a deal it is

331
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,360
because if I don't if I'm not able to

332
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,100
advertise for my service online my work

333
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,019
I can't get I can't get a job I can't

334
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,420
pay the bills etc etc it also pushes sex

335
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,639
workers to to the very limits and the

336
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,200
margins and so if you can't get work

337
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
online where do you go you go to the

338
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,440
street which is

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,019
um where lots of sex workers face the

340
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,880
most amount of violence is on the street

341
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
um the more so

342
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,839
it is a big deal you know it's not it's

343
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,459
not just like some silly thing like you

344
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,139
know all right they deleted a post that

345
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,420
I made about whatever it's a really big

346
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,459
deal you know some of the recent years

347
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,660
there's been heavier restrictions online

348
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,820
and we might ask why is sex work so

349
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,260
censored on the internet

350
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,399
um it's a highly complicated question

351
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,680
with complicated answers but we could

352
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,019
start to describe the Why by explaining

353
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,940
two bills that were passed in 2018

354
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,100
sounds like a long time ago but they're

355
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,480
still having an effect in the United

356
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,980
States and they had an impact on sex

357
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,560
workers and internet censorship in

358
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,480
general worldwide

359
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,060
so uh you probably have heard of sestan

360
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,320
foster

361
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,260
um they sound good in in principle but

362
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,420
they're not that great

363
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,920
um there's a stop enabling sex

364
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,019
traffickers act which is Zesta and the

365
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,880
fight online sex trafficking act which

366
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,980
is Foster there are package bills that

367
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,440
were passed in April of 2018

368
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,760
um that made it illegal to publish sex

369
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,160
online they are designed initially to

370
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,220
censor online content in order to curb

371
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,620
sex trafficking they are meant to amend

372
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,940
the section 230 of the communications

373
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,800
decency act something that makes online

374
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
services immune for liability of their

375
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
users

376
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,760
um

377
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,040
and it would make section 239 applying

378
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,139
cases of sex trafficking so before

379
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,240
sister and Foster I'm sure maybe you

380
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,199
know this but I'm going to tell you

381
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,519
anyways

382
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,720
um websites and internet service

383
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,600
providers were not liable for their user

384
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,160
generated content posted on their

385
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
platforms including advertisement

386
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,899
comments forms etc etc without this

387
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,519
Clause exempting websites from liability

388
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,680
of their actions of their users most

389
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,899
websites couldn't afford to exist they

390
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,519
would just have to perpetually ward off

391
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,620
potential legal actions based on

392
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,240
inflammatory comments or unpredictable

393
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,459
behavior of their users

394
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,860
by devoting endless resources to

395
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,079
moderating everything the users did by

396
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,420
or by simply bending users activity

397
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,279
altogether by throwing millions of

398
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,040
dollars at litigation costs so now the

399
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,320
owner of any platform

400
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,300
um that pose content involving sexual

401
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,180
activity including consensual sex work

402
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,040
can be sentenced up to 25 years in

403
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,620
prison so foster ancesta amends this two

404
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,440
section the section 230 of the 1996

405
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,320
Communications decency act and

406
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,540
um to allow prosecutors to penalize

407
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,399
internet companies that promote or

408
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,160
facilitate prostitution so as a result

409
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,380
of system Foster major Pages were shut

410
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,820
down one of the biggest ones that was

411
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,740
shut down was uh one that was called

412
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,940
Backpage

413
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,980
I was a website basically where you

414
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,480
could advertise for your services and

415
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,579
get contacted by clients

416
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,199
um it didn't just help us meet resource

417
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,000
needs but also help to stay safer access

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,980
and Community being able to organize

419
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,240
those things that I said before about

420
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,640
the pros of doing online sex work so

421
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,199
Backpage was a vital tool for sex

422
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,819
workers and shutting it down could be

423
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,859
compared to that of a massive layoff

424
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,160
affecting providers all around the world

425
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,480
um it didn't just affect people in the

426
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,559
United States

427
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
taking away those tools obviously

428
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,620
affected the most marginalized

429
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,360
communities like the bipod community and

430
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,299
the 2s lgbtqi Community who are more

431
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,220
likely to face unemployment and housing

432
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,200
discrimination and more likely to rely

433
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,480
on sex work to survive

434
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,179
um when sex worker responded Mr Smarties

435
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,100
she said it's true that any system can

436
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,720
be abused but the idea that removing

437
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,280
sites that are is going to make someone

438
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,380
who is going to sexually abuse someone

439
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,080
say never mind is ridiculous it's a

440
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,940
child's view of the world

441
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,880
these bills have done so much damage uh

442
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,799
to sex work because they've basically

443
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,440
conflated sex work and trafficking which

444
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,419
are two separate things it pushes us all

445
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,100
into one corner and the more that we use

446
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,380
terms like teen prostitute instead of

447
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,360
using the word trafficked teen the less

448
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,620
we're actually solving the problem that

449
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,539
we claim to be you know concerned about

450
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,720
um

451
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,640
okay so how am I doing for time I'm

452
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,020
running out of time now um because

453
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,700
that's not created this kind of fake

454
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,160
crisis conflating sex work with

455
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,960
trafficking or child trafficking many

456
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,580
websites were sent into a full-blown

457
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,140
panic and they didn't want to be

458
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,240
conflated either or caught up in any you

459
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,039
know legal stuff so their response was

460
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
uh well we're gonna kick sex workers out

461
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,600
or anything related to sex so there was

462
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,400
an outcry of anti-sex worker groups

463
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,419
celebrities even jumped on the on the

464
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,600
bandwagon like Amy Schumer uh sorry I

465
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,980
won't get into her comment it was

466
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,480
ridiculous

467
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,580
um and they were like you know this

468
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,840
outcry about like you know what about

469
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,700
the children and you know

470
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,740
um if without these bills a child's

471
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,600
trafficking is going to run rampant you

472
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
know there's a lot of actions that took

473
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
place to make sure that sex workers were

474
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,240
de-platformed but really little action

475
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,160
to deal like to actually you know deal

476
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,780
with the problem that they were

477
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,679
um supposedly you know concerned about

478
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,760
to date actually this is really

479
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,620
important to date it's resulted in just

480
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,660
one Federal prosecution

481
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,520
according to the new report from the

482
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,840
government accountability offices are

483
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,539
they jail so basically there's been no

484
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,640
like it's not been useful at all and

485
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,900
actually a lot of people that were

486
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,720
pushing for this bill like to be passed

487
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,700
um they they gaslit sex workers saying

488
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,440
this is this isn't gonna with this isn't

489
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,600
meant to harm you but they knew that it

490
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,980
was going to harm us even though we said

491
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,799
we said it and um they haven't really

492
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,240
even been public about this one

493
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
prosecution because I think that they

494
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,380
they knew that this bill was just really

495
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,000
going after sex work and not after

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
trafficking because

497
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,240
um yeah there hasn't been any kind of

498
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,700
like you know any update about how

499
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,740
system first is working Etc et cetera

500
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,440
because it's not working

501
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
um another thing is payment processors

502
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,500
have become really strict with anything

503
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,539
that can be screwed construed to sex

504
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,460
work and social media Giants obviously

505
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,260
decided to crack down in any material

506
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,720
that can be interpreted at all could get

507
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,760
you deleted even you know a sexual Emoji

508
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,700
because they really Instagram or meta

509
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,559
said like even emojis in the sexual

510
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,900
nature and I'm like which Emoji is going

511
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
to be like the sexual you know what I

512
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,080
mean it was like anything could be

513
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
sexual nature like some Emoji smiling I

514
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,980
have no idea the Emoji that there's a

515
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,200
face you know like I have no idea you

516
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,760
know but anyways that could get you

517
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,220
deleted so as I mentioned before the

518
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,960
Digital Sex work really shaped for the

519
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,780
passing of these bills and um what if

520
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,940
says didn't force to have in common

521
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,200
um firstly they put sex workers in

522
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,760
danger cycling they threaten the whole

523
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,320
population in terms of privacy

524
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,600
violations and encryption as we heard in

525
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,940
the um the chat before

526
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,900
um

527
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,000
and then they made it also complicated

528
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,679
for anyone who marginal identity to have

529
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,840
a platform basically you know these

530
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,520
bills destroy destroy our right to

531
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,919
privacy Freedom digital rights

532
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:00,539
um they want to destroy all forms of

533
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,520
encryption and so nobody gets it

534
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,200
unscathed it's not just a sex worker

535
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,799
issue it's an everybody issue you know

536
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,900
um okay sorry how am I going oh two

537
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,419
minutes oh my God okay

538
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:15,320
I I don't like this at all

539
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,660
um okay so not far behind system Foster

540
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,940
only fans followed to try to get rid of

541
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,140
sex workers if you don't know only fans

542
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,419
as a platform that provides content for

543
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,700
a subscription service usually mainly

544
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,620
used by sex workers but also other

545
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,360
people can exist on there if you're a

546
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,280
chef and you want to sell your recipes

547
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,620
great good good for you

548
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,100
um no one's going to pay for that but

549
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,780
my only friends can come sue me now

550
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,940
before the pandemic this site generated

551
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,620
lots of income but obviously during the

552
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,240
pandemic everyone's at home with you

553
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,620
know some disposable income and lots of

554
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,179
time on their hands people bought porn

555
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,760
great that's amazing sex workers

556
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,460
um helped build only fans essentially

557
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,440
only fans would not be where it is today

558
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
without sex workers having like you know

559
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,640
broke their backs to for them to be

560
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,260
where they are and it was a critical

561
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,120
tool for us you know and then only fans

562
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,679
was triumphing booming in sales

563
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,419
everything seemed really great meanwhile

564
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,640
there was lurking this uh crisis that we

565
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,159
didn't know sex workers didn't know they

566
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,780
came with announcement this past August

567
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,200
19th that they would ban sexually no not

568
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,080
this past one the year before

569
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,059
um that they would ban sexually explicit

570
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,860
content on their main platform super

571
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,900
shocking because like again like I said

572
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,240
like who like what were they thinking

573
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,919
you know like who are they who's going

574
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,900
to keep paying for I mean everybody that

575
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,820
goes the only fans looking for

576
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,799
um specific sexual content and not like

577
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
you know recipes from some weird Chef

578
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,400
you know

579
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,059
um so anyways basically they they kicked

580
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,440
they were gonna they threatened to kick

581
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
sex workers off their platform

582
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,880
sex workers were outraged as well was

583
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,260
outraged

584
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,080
um and then like a few days later they

585
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,520
completely backtracked their statement

586
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
we're like oh we didn't mean it uh we

587
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,880
would never kick sex workers off our

588
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
platform they realized it was a big

589
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,400
mistake obviously they were going to

590
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
lose billions uh billions of euros and

591
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
um it wasn't they weren't really clear

592
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,640
they were kind of shady they said it was

593
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,860
Bank Banks basically

594
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,320
um that was the reason why that they

595
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,720
couldn't process the payments which was

596
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,760
later then they just magically found

597
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,620
another bank to work with they didn't

598
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,299
publicly comment on who they were

599
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,280
working with but yeah basically this

600
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,500
essentially um This Disaster is a very

601
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,900
real crisis for sex workers and can be

602
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,000
tied back to susten Foster

603
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,919
um a lot of companies Idol companies

604
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,480
were feeling the pressure MasterCard

605
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,820
also put on tighter regulations in 2021

606
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,520
around any content that's sexual

607
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,179
um so anyways uh yes only fans okay I'm

608
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,440
gonna read Ezra's statement and then I'm

609
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,520
gonna stop

610
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,620
so Ezra also published a statement after

611
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,200
only fans decided to try to ban us

612
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,880
um Ezra strongly condemns only fans

613
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,679
initial decision on imposing a ban on

614
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
explicit content on the platform this

615
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,700
disturbing and unfair decision caused

616
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,440
high levels of stress and uncertainty in

617
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,179
the sex worker Community although the

618
00:23:57,179 --> 00:23:59,100
suspension of explicit content banned

619
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,240
can be considered a step in the right

620
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
direction

621
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
there's an urgent need to address the

622
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,860
underlying reasons of exclusion of sex

623
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,659
workers from digital platforms and

624
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,000
financial services among other things as

625
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,440
what demands that digital platforms

626
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,720
revoke anti-sex work policies and make

627
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,760
changes I make public apologies to sex

628
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,679
worker communities

629
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,240
um only fans kind of made a half-fast

630
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,159
apology they didn't really really care

631
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,500
that we were really stressed out and so

632
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,700
despite having to deal with a fake

633
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,440
crisis the conflation of sex work and

634
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,419
trafficking amongst the real crisis

635
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,220
covid sex workers wouldn't receive any

636
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,020
money from the government

637
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,539
um we didn't disappear after these bills

638
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,940
instead we've globally mobilized sex

639
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,679
workers and massive numbers we've

640
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,820
created new community-based

641
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,440
organizations based on our needs and

642
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,419
have done lots of research and during

643
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,100
the Copic crisis we received little or

644
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,600
no help from the government we created

645
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Mutual Aid projects across the globe

646
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,320
We've Come Together in president's

647
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,059
situation to support each other and make

648
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,100
sure that we don't get left behind so to

649
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,200
summarize sex Works sex workers greatly

650
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,240
rely on digital tools to have safer

651
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,039
working conditions and the removal of

652
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,260
sex workers from these platforms and

653
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,940
tools only puts us a greater risk of

654
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,500
harm and precarity

655
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,880
we need to be listened to when we're

656
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,500
talking about grave laws being passed

657
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,539
about our work because Bill's accepted

658
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,340
and Foster had years of damage in our

659
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,799
community and continued to harm us they

660
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,240
could have been prevented if sex workers

661
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
were centered in these conversations so

662
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,960
going forward we need to make greater

663
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,940
efforts to Make spaces for sex workers

664
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,500
voices and lived experiences of

665
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,980
discrimination

666
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,980
thank you very much Kelly uh

667
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,720
I know it's okay and you will realize

668

inviting us

and

688
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,520
um I must say I thought it was very

689
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,279
fitting uh for Edward to set this year's

690
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,380
uh you know team as the constant state

691
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,960
of Crisis and also point out that the

692
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,179
digital is critical

693
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,980
um especially from sex workers point of

694
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,779
view you know because we feel like this

695
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,659
constant state of Crisis is the usual

696
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,940
way of living and just the normal state

697
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,960
of the world

698
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
if you're a sex worker

699
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,179
the infrastructures and tools that are

700
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,460
critical to sex workers are constantly

701
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,580
being attacked by actors who do not only

702
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,980
use legitimate crisis as opportunities

703
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,039
to push their agenda of excluding and

704
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,659
criminalizing sex workers but also

705
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,539
construct construct crisis for the same

706
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,760
purpose as Gadi mentioned

707
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,620
and sex workers

708
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,779
always had a very close in it it's very

709
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,940
intimate relationship with technology I

710
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,500
mean you know throughout this story sex

711
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,020
workers were one of the early adopters

712
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
of new communication Technologies in

713
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,539
order to you know communicate with their

714
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,940
clients and advertise their services so

715
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,580
sex workers use both print media and you

716
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,799
know other visual media very very fairly

717
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,260
early on which these sex workers then

718
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,020
became one of the first adapters of

719
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,299
Internet so in a sense they helped

720
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,360
develop the you know first versions of

721
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,200
Internet

722
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,820
as we know it but you know

723
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,919
so there has been many benefits of

724
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:43,620
digital tools for sex workers and today

725
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,740
they are definitely like an Inseparable

726
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,799
part of how sex work is conducted in

727
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,860
Europe and globally actually

728
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,900
however simultaneously sex workers are

729
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
being Stripped Away of these very

730
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,080
important tools

731
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,419
because you already mentioned her

732
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,220
experiences as a worker and how

733
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,080
platforms like only fans for example are

734
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
critical for sex work and how this

735
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,340
critical tool is being taken away from

736
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,140
sex workers by companies who constantly

737
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,779
undermine sex workers rights and exclude

738
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,320
them from their services even during

739
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,200
actual state of Crisis such as kovid

740
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,179
of course private Act is often you know

741
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,120
base their actions uh that undermine sex

742
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,279
workers rights on the existing legal

743
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,000
Frameworks and this legal Frameworks or

744
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
the lack of appropriate appropriate

745
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,900
legal protection for sex workers are the

746
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,140
enablers of companies and platforms

747
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,000
discriminatory and harmful policies

748
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,919
so as mentioned for example foster

749
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,440
sister is a good example of how the

750
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,299
rhetoric on the human trafficking crisis

751
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:48,179
is utilized and hijacked by

752
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,880
anti-trafficking organizations in

753
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,020
collaboration with right-wing

754
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,000
evangelists in the US

755
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,820
2D platform sex workers leaving sex

756
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,580
workers no space to Breathe No Room for

757
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,740
self-expression and no possibility to

758
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,659
generate income

759
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,279
and

760
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,419
um

761
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,299
so all foster sister did was to put sex

762
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,100
workers livelihoods health and safety in

763
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,900
danger and the conflation of trafficking

764
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,460
and sex work is detrimental to

765
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,260
fundamental human rights of sex workers

766
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,419
and we have seen this repeatedly

767
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:19,919
happening over the years for example

768
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,260
some politicians keep referring to sex

769
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,360
work advertising platforms where sex

770
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,980
workers put their ad in contact with

771
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,120
their clients so it's their online

772
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,460
workspace of sex workers

773
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,980
we see again again politicians referring

774
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,360
to these websites is essentially

775
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,159
important websites as trafficking

776
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,480
websites

777
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,960
so this is of course you know purposeful

778
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,659
framing of these play workplaces as

779
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,340
something that they are not instead of

780
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,580
acknowledging the importance of an

781
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,220
actual purpose of these platforms they

782
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,440
are framed as trafficking websites to

783
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,659
manipulate public opinion to get these

784
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,399
platforms to shut down so it's an

785
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,740
ideological war on sex work and

786
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,020
pornography that unites certain branches

787
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,260
of famous movements and right-wing

788
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,659
extremists which is mind-blowing

789
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,120
uh we believe that abusive working

790
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,020
conditions can happen in any sector work

791
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,360
can be degrading and workers may find

792
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,740
themselves in exploitative working

793
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,419
conditions

794
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,880
no matter what they do so the difference

795
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,799
here is that workers normally have

796
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,240
rights that they can pursue right

797
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
because sex work is not

798
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,620
recognized as work and is heavily

799
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,539
criminalized when this abuse happen

800
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,539
happens in sex industry sex workers have

801
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:36,419
nowhere to go so the for us the real way

802
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,279
to fight the exploitation in the sex

803
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,919
industry is therefore to Grant rights to

804
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,380
sex workers like New Zealand does and

805
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,820
there isn't the Belgium took a step

806
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,320
towards the conversation of sex work

807
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,240
which we upload

808
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,039
of course sex workers rights are also

809
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,899
attacked by those with no apparent

810
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,080
agenda of criminalizing sex work and in

811
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
these cases the harm mostly arises from

812
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,279
actors who might have good intentions

813
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,460
however due to lack of Engagement with

814
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,020
sex workers and other marginalized

815
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,520
populations sex workers end up being

816
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,440
collateral damage in the policy making

817
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,700
process

818
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,340
so a fairly recent example of this was

819
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,279
the Digital Services act

820
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,960
where the European greens proposed an

821
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,980
amendment

822
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,899
with the support of victims rights or

823
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,240
organizations working on the issue of

824
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,899
image-based sexual abuse so

825
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,460
non-non-consensual sharing of images

826
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,460
and Amendment 24b that's what it was

827
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,860
called if except it would have made it

828
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,899
mandatory for platforms that host

829
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,960
user-generated pornographic content to

830
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,840
verify users by collecting their phone

831
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,240
numbers and verified email addresses so

832
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,340
that police could track down the

833
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,100
potential perpetrator based on the data

834
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,360
they provided

835
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,340
so image based abuse is certainly an

836
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,320
important issue to tackle and it is part

837
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,299
of a wider structural problem which is

838
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,039
violence against women

839
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,080
and it is also a fact that many sex

840
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,779
workers are victims of image-based abuse

841
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,520
it can be you know clients downloading

842
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,640
and distributing our images or using

843
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,380
them to Blackmail sex workers and for

844
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,480
extortion it can be other platforms and

845
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,919
websites that collect and create

846
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,500
everything content stealing you know sex

847
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,000
workers as pictures from their own

848
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,399
website to put their own website to

849
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,740
drive traffic basically

850
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,480
so it's a problem that is highly

851
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,520
relevant to sex workers but we fought

852
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,899
against this amendment for several

853
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,600
reasons first of all we advocate for

854
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,460
data minimization especially when

855
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,740
working with marginalized communities

856
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,539
increase data collection and processing

857
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,640
is a threat to privacy and as well as

858
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,380
coming to research on privacy as well as

859
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,240
other many research shows that

860
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,820
protecting privacy and data is crucial

861
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,620
to ensure the safety of sex workers

862
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,760
privacy acts as a protective barrier and

863
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,860
um when privacy is lost sex workers

864
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,980
report that they experience harassment

865
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,919
blackmailing lose their accommodation

866
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,840
and Face-Off face

867
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,460
threat of deportation

868
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,799
secondly there was no reason to believe

869
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,659
such additional data collection measures

870
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,940
would prevent image-based abuse the fact

871
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,320
is that the vast majority of porn

872
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,700
platforms are already collecting

873
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,380
horrifying amounts of sensitive data

874
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,179
like Kelly said you know when sex

875
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,559
workers are registered on these

876
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
platforms they have to send their

877
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,980
passport copies they have send their ID

878
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,799
copies they have to send their selfies

879
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,419
in order to you know show the platform

880
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,440
look it's me and they have to sign

881
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,600
consent forms with their real names so

882
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,519
all these horrifying amounts of data

883
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,799
sensitive data is collected and stored

884
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,080
by the platforms so it wasn't clear for

885
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,919
us how collecting even more data of sex

886
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,440
workers would actually you know stop

887
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,480
image-based abuse if collecting the

888
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,880
passport copies didn't stop the image

889
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,140
based abuse

890
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,000
finally as I explained sex workers are

891
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,320
one of the populations to experience

892
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,059
image-based abuse and it is their online

893
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,760
workplace this amendment directly aimed

894
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,919
to regulate so in this case it was clear

895
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,620
for us that sex workers should have been

896
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,159
consulted as priority stakeholder but

897
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,200
that wasn't the case

898
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,719
we also argued that the non-consensual

899
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,460
sharing of images occurs on every

900
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,440
platform online and it is not limited to

901
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,418
porn platforms so this amendment ended

902
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,859
up being discriminatory against sex

903
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,379
workers at that time you were saying

904
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,119
following their logic if it makes sense

905
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,639
it would make more sense to ask every

906
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,139
internet user to disclose their

907
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,379
sensitive data on every platform

908
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:30,418
but unfortunately you know of course we

909
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,599
didn't want this but now there are

910
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,780
concerning policy proposals at EU level

911
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,280
that threaten the privacy of everyone

912
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,260
and not just sex workers which is you

913
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,879
know one of them is child sexual abuse

914
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,859
regulation

915
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,839
so as I'm sure many of you heard of this

916
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,179
proposal even if you are not directly

917
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,800
working on it European commission

918
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,399
proposed prepared a proposal that would

919
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,379
will allow sales providers to scan

920
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,260
private conversations in order to

921
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,200
supposedly the text child sexual abuse

922
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,940
material and prevent the further

923
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,680
distribution of this material

924
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,839
and through this regulation once again

925
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,900
we see the trend of pitting fundamental

926
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,480
human rights such as right to privacy

927
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,700
against you know important issues like

928
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,400
the protection of minors continues in

929
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,440
addition we against it over Reliance and

930
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,300
trust or trust in technological

931
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,160
solutions to tackle uh you know

932
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,040
structural societal problems as sex

933
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,260
worker rights Network that work on

934
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,619
topics like privacy and data protection

935
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:32,820
of marginalized communities we are

936
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,800
extremely worried about this regulation

937
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,020
because it is not currently in line with

938
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,359
fundamental human rights and the use of

939
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,700
automated systems to detect such content

940
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,859
we believe is going to create lots of

941
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,619
false positive results which will

942
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,540
increase the chances of sex workers

943
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,400
becoming in contact with police officers

944
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
which are the one of the you know

945
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,180
perpetrator of violence against sex

946
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,380
workers

947
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,560
and it is also very damaging to the

948
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,660
human psyche to feel like every move you

949
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,099
take is surveilled by private

950
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,079
corporations and governments alike even

951
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,359
if the part of your identity or the work

952
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,160
you do is not criminalized like sex

953
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,720
workers

954
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,420
what this regulation tells us is that

955
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,200
it's variable leak I think that's

956
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,020
you know we are not able to find ways to

957
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,119
tackle these issues and manage crisis

958
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,619
without treating some portion of the

959
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,460
population as collateral damage so csam

960
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,079
regulations nothing less than Mass

961
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,359
serving's practice for us which doesn't

962
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,480
even do much in terms of protecting

963
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,520
children and we find it find it very

964
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,040
disproportionate and there is no legal

965
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,140
basis for imposing this level of

966
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,000
servings on everyone without reasonable

967
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,460
suspicion

968
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,500
um finally I'm gonna just mention One

969
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,960
National level development that is very

970
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,660
concerning and use that uses this crisis

971
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,640
rhetoric that politicians loves to use

972
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,700
which is Online safety bill in the UK

973
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,060
uh uh so this so-called Online safety

974
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,740
bill in the UK is a prime example of how

975
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,960
legitimate intention of protecting

976
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,180
children from online time is again

977
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,400
utilized to increase online surveillance

978
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,339
to further push online service providers

979
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,619
to discriminate against sex workers so

980
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,359
it is very similar to the foster sister

981
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,760
actually and the effect impact they will

982
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
have will be again very similar to

983
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,500
foster sister so it essentially makes

984
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,079
sex work content it defines sexual

985
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,079
content as harmful content and there is

986
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,700
a line in the bill saying that

987
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,880
controlling prostitution for gain is a

988
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,920
criminal activity but controlling

989
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,020
prostitution for gain is interpreted

990
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,660
very widely in the criminal courts Our

991
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,480
member organization in the UK the

992
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,980
English Collective of prostitutes

993
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,900
reports that some women have been

994
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,540
prosecuted under this offense just for

995
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,400
helping a friend for example build a

996
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,460
website or place an advert online so

997
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,680
companies who aim to avoid any potential

998
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,380
liability will make the move to D

999
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,720
platform not only sexual content and sex

1000
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,820
workers as you know accounts but

1001
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,900
possibly all erotic and sexual content

1002
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,940
so the result will be as devastating as

1003
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,820
for Success so the recap and finance I

1004
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,020
just wanna

1005
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,500
make three points first of all is

1006
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,260
so there are legitimate crises that we

1007
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,660
are facing today and it is crucial uh to

1008
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,880
have a you know robust police landscape

1009
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
that seeks to address these very

1010
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,140
important issues however we should be

1011
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,359
aware that when there's crisis

1012
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:32,579
uh there are always people who use those

1013
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,240
crises to exploit our feelings to push

1014
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,680
their own agenda

1015
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,440
we should therefore have a very critical

1016
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,300
mind when we are facing politicians and

1017
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,640
other actors who use overly emotional

1018
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,099
and alarming language to push for their

1019
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:48,900
agenda such as you know increasing

1020
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,240
surveillance for example

1021
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,260
my second point is that tackling techno

1022
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,540
solutionism is very important

1023
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,359
for us we are aware that technology has

1024
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,099
a very important space when we are

1025
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,020
trying to come up come up with you know

1026
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,240
solutions to our problems however techno

1027
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,520
Solutions and we see today is especially

1028
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,859
in the voice making is like okay we you

1029
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,660
know build this fancy algorithm or you

1030
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,520
know we collect lots of more data and

1031
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,720
then everything will be fine we don't

1032
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,000
have to do anything else obviously it

1033
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
doesn't work we are therefore advocating

1034
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,780
for structural solutions that address

1035
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,240
the root cause of societal problems so

1036
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,859
technology won't have a meaningful

1037
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:28,040
impact on this we try to tackle racism

1038
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,599
poverty talk about borders and lack of

1039
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,119
education for sex workers for example

1040
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,619
the starting point is the

1041
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,020
decriminalization of sex work which

1042
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,359
would Grant labor rights to sex workers

1043
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,400
and help effectively fight human

1044
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320
trafficking violence and exploitation in

1045
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,660
the sex industry finally ethical

1046
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,400
inclusive and fact-based policy making

1047
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,040
is needed more than ever today there is

1048
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
a lack of ethical post-making at both

1049
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,900
National and EU level where policies are

1050
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,640
being drafted amendments are put forward

1051
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,500
like DSA

1052
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,960
without doing the exercise of matting

1053
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,780
mapping out stakeholders and to then

1054
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,579
initiating conversations with these

1055
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,380
stakeholders only by being truly

1056
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,640
inclusive we can lay out effective laws

1057
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,200
it is also equally important that the

1058
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,079
different stakeholders in an issue uh

1059
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,180
talk to one another and actively seek

1060
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,000
ways to collaborate to this end as well

1061
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,099
has initiated a process that aims to

1062
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,079
tackle image-based abuse issues

1063
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,200
collaboratively with other stakeholders

1064
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,599
for example and as the first step of

1065
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,579
this process we partnered up with the

1066
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,099
Max Planck Institute in a research

1067
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,160
project that's Elisa will discuss I

1068
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,380
think next thank you so much for

1069
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,900
listening

1070
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,769
[Applause]

1071
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,619
thank you so much Eid we can talk a bit

1072
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,760
more after as well about some of the

1073
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,920
program we are doing I'll mention as

1074
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
well this multi-stakeholder dialogue we

1075
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,940
will be developing with adri as well and

1076
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,339
Elisa will be part of and I now give the

1077
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:05,400
floor to Elisa thank you

1078
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,440
thanks Luca

1079
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,560
um thank you I will end up echoing uh in

1080
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,780
some ways a number of the things uh that

1081
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,640
have been said before me

1082
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,160
um so as Luca had introduced on a

1083
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,540
faculty member at the Max Planck

1084
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,880
Institute and I run a research group

1085
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,540
where we have been uh working with sex

1086
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,579
working communities and looking at the

1087
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,339
role of digital technology in sex work

1088
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,880
for the past um five years and I come

1089
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,500
out of the field of computer security

1090
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,780
and so what brought me to this work was

1091
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,240
feeling like the tools that we were

1092
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,400
building as technologists and the

1093
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,660
research we were doing as computer

1094
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,119
scientists particularly in security I

1095
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,940
was not necessarily addressing the needs

1096
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,339
of sex working communities and other

1097
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,560
marginalized communities for a number of

1098
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,780
reasons that have already been raised on

1099
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,980
this panel

1100
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,940
so a lot of our work has involved doing

1101
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,040
hundreds of paid interviews uh with

1102
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,260
different types of sex workers all

1103
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,500
around the world uh to understand sex

1104
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,720
workers safety goals the risks they're

1105
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,839
facing their strategies for coping with

1106
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,720
those risks and the goal of our work is

1107
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,119
really to try to understand how

1108
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,180
technology can start stop hurting and

1109
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,680
start helping

1110
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,599
um people achieve their their labor

1111
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,800
goals

1112
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,660
um and so some of our our initial work

1113
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,440
uh started out with in-person workers in

1114
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,560
Germany Switzerland and the UK

1115
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,960
um and then has progressed to look at

1116
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,020
folks who are doing either in person or

1117
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,440
digital only work uh in the U.S and in

1118
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,619
other regions around the world in

1119
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,480
addition to looking at kind of folks

1120
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,040
labor practices and the role of

1121
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,220
Technology and Safety technology and in

1122
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,240
that we have also done a bit of work on

1123
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,400
understanding kind of the the harms and

1124
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,440
measuring the efficacy of some of the

1125
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,020
anti-trafficking solutions that are out

1126
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,660
there um so to offer one example

1127
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,540
and the United States in particular as

1128
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,000
well as in other regions and there was

1129
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,579
sort of this idea that oh if we you know

1130
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,300
do these unsolicited text messages uh so

1131
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,000
if we scrape sex worker advertisements

1132
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
we put that data in a database and then

1133
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,760
we text people and by we I don't mean us

1134
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,819
but we being some some organization uh

1135
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:31,619
we text people and we ask hey are you

1136
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,240
being trafficked

1137
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,099
um that maybe this would be a good way

1138
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,780
of stopping trafficking

1139
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,839
um and as might be intuitive this is not

1140
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,000
a good way to stop trafficking and the

1141
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,980
organizations that do this themselves

1142
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,079
say that they get less than a five

1143
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,780
percent response rate to these texts

1144
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,180
um and also of course the scraping is a

1145
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,160
privacy violation and it can be quite

1146
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,680
dangerous for folks right so folks are

1147
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,619
not always sole owners of their phones

1148
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,300
and the person they share a device with

1149
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,060
may or may not know that they're doing

1150
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,099
um sex work and so getting one of these

1151
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,880
texts links that information the texts

1152
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,760
are often also very stigmatizing and

1153
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,339
harassing and might have religious uh

1154
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,760
information in them all of which can be

1155
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,660
triggering and uncomfortable and

1156
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,880
emotionally harmful so there are a lot

1157
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,440
of harms that can come from this kind of

1158
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,200
Outreach and also very little benefit

1159
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,400
even

1160
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,099
um partly organizations themselves and a

1161
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,900
lot of times the the data that gets

1162
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,940
scraped is actually sold to non-profits

1163
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,680
so people are kind of profiting off of

1164
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,200
this uh scraping of sex workers

1165
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,880
information

1166
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
um so that's sort of an example of work

1167
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,200
that we do where we'll

1168
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,420
um work with the impacted Community to

1169
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,980
kind of understand you know how is this

1170
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,680
harming you and then try to convince

1171
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,440
technologists not to do uh these kinds

1172
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,780
of things on the positive side we also

1173
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,880
partner with organizations

1174
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,280
um like eswa on topics like intimate

1175
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,140
image abuse as eat

1176
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,260
um was introducing so before we get to

1177
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,880
talking about our current work on

1178
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,800
intimate image abuse I wanted to touch

1179
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,380
on a couple of findings from kind of the

1180
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,819
hundreds of interviews that we've done

1181
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:14,640
with sex workers over the years

1182
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,880
um the first is sort of largely echoing

1183
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,000
um what kalyani have mentioned

1184
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,400
um sex workers right are forced to use

1185
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,319
Technologies and platforms that don't

1186
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,119
take into account their business or

1187
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,980
privacy needs

1188
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,500
um and as someone who came out of the

1189
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,420
the US originally I sometimes got

1190
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,760
pushback that was like oh well the work

1191
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,160
people is are doing you know isn't legal

1192
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,680
here and and so you know maybe it's okay

1193
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,599
that platforms don't support it right

1194
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:45,420
but a lot of the workers that that we

1195
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,280
work with right and this won't be a

1196
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,740
surprise in the European context are

1197
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,460
working legally are paying taxes are

1198
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,560
registered to work where they are and

1199
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,680
yet they still can't use digital payment

1200
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,020
Technologies or they still get kicked

1201
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,119
off of Airbnb even if they're using

1202
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,920
three different phones where one of them

1203
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,380
is dedicated for Airbnb to try not to

1204
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,700
get kicked off

1205
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,060
and that's really kind of an imposition

1206
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,839
of one particular kind of framework

1207
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,000
um which certainly I disagree with but

1208
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,319
still it's an imposition of one

1209
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,180
country's framework on other countries

1210
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,940
and other workers in those countries

1211
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,339
um and so it's really kind of not the

1212
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,680
case that at least as far as I can see

1213
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,300
there's a justification for not taking

1214
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,760
into account people's business needs let

1215
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,000
alone at safety and privacy needs um

1216
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,660
for their work and so examples of issues

1217
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,579
that we've seen facing workers as

1218
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,099
mentioned are de-platforming from all

1219
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:46,079
different kinds of platforms regardless

1220
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,000
of the legal status of the work being

1221
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,500
performed

1222
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,560
um folks being outed or doxxed uh being

1223
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,020
harassed which can spill into real life

1224
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,819
right so it's not the case that just

1225
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,980
because something happens online it

1226
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,700
never makes it into kind of real world

1227
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,980
context it absolutely does

1228
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,260
um Financial harm particularly from the

1229
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,220
platforming from Financial platforms

1230
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,540
content theft as we've mentioned and

1231
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,000
then also burnout right and this is

1232
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,920
something that has been touched on a

1233
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,480
little bit in this panel but of course

1234
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,960
the pandemic made a huge change in how

1235
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,780
people were doing labor both for folks

1236
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,060
who are already doing sex work as well

1237
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,920
as for folks who came into the industry

1238
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,800
during the pandemic and while kind of

1239
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,440
echoing a Cali's notes

1240
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,960
um you know folks were safer from

1241
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,780
distance from police

1242
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,660
and distance from kind of physical

1243
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,579
interaction and we also see that it

1244
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,280
changed people's digital portfolios so

1245
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,260
they were telling us well you know

1246
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,960
compared to when I was doing

1247
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,599
say only in person work I'm finding that

1248
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,359
I have to be online on more platforms I

1249
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,480
have to be sharing kind of more content

1250
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
people are wanting to have like a richer

1251
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,400
online persona for me

1252
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,140
um and I might be having to be like a

1253
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,319
little bit more explicit or more visible

1254
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,599
online like maybe I used to be able to

1255
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,180
not show my face but now there's so much

1256
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,339
competition in this online only space

1257
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:20,220
and a little bit of difference in

1258
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,720
um sort of what folks are looking for

1259
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,660
that that's a much harder thing to make

1260
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,700
viable business-wise so people are kind

1261
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,040
of finding themselves more online in

1262
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,560
more places putting more content being

1263
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,140
more explicit and that raises some of

1264
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,780
the the digital concerns that you might

1265
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,760
have particularly around like content

1266
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,099
theft right finding your content

1267
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,280
um places that you don't want it to be

1268
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,920
and so a couple of quotes

1269
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,140
um we've had from participants that

1270
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,540
maybe give a little bit of color uh to

1271
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,700
these experiences are in one of our

1272
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,099
studies a participant said you know I

1273
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,460
took a selfie in a public restroom and I

1274
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,240
uploaded that to a social media site and

1275
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,099
there was a guy that went to the same

1276
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,099
bathroom and posted a selfie of him in

1277
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:11,400
that bathroom directly undermine like I

1278
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,920
know where you are and so that kind of

1279
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,140
stalker things are the ones that make me

1280
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,180
more scared

1281
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,960
uh another participant said you know the

1282
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,480
platforms or Platforms in general are

1283
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,940
the this thin ice that I'm walking on

1284
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,119
and at one point it's going to break and

1285
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,700
everything is just gonna go you know to

1286
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,940
Hell uh and I'm gonna fall through and

1287
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,980
this is sort of a common

1288
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,660
um sentiment among hundreds of people

1289
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,760
that we've talked to is these platforms

1290
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,420
are thin ice and they also sometimes are

1291
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,540
facilitating harms like the first one

1292
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,220
right they're they're really showing

1293
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,839
your content to everyone which in some

1294
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,980
ways is good

1295
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,079
and in other ways is not so good because

1296
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:58,079
people uh don't always behave in the way

1297
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,960
that we wish toward other people

1298
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,240
so our goal is to change how technology

1299
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,599
is built in order to try to improve

1300
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,819
safety and we do this through a number

1301
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,800
of different Partnerships uh but the one

1302
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,200
that I'll touch on today is the work

1303
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,920
they eat and Luca mentioned which is a

1304
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,280
set of research and design projects to

1305
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,619
try to develop features for preventing

1306
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,900
intimate image abuse

1307
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,660
um so intimate image abuse uh has

1308
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,160
probably what I'd say like three

1309
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,020
different components

1310
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,440
um and what we are focused on is folks

1311
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,420
who are consensually producing images

1312
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,300
whether for recreation uh so like

1313
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,760
sexters or for labor

1314
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,520
um like digital sex workers and so

1315
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,319
they're consensually creating the image

1316
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,880
we're not focused on

1317
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,559
um kind of non-consensual whether it's

1318
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,660
like secret recording Etc

1319
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,119
um consensually creating the image

1320
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,040
they're sharing it somewhere posting it

1321
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,960
somewhere but then it's finding they're

1322
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,599
finding that image uh being spread

1323
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,640
outside of wherever they initially

1324
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,559
posted it right and I think there's

1325
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,540
sometimes this misconception that's like

1326
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,660
oh if you've posted your image on only

1327
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,319
fans you must be okay with it appearing

1328
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,599
anywhere else on the internet and that's

1329
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,240
not true right both because you

1330
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,339
consented to have it typically behind a

1331
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,800
paywall for your subscribers on only

1332
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,020
fans or in the case of recreational

1333
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,599
folks on a particular

1334
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,720
platform one-on-one chat group chat

1335
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,960
whatever it was and two in the case of

1336
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,220
content

1337
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,520
um for commercial purposes it's theft

1338
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,859
right if someone takes your content and

1339
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:42,599
posts it somewhere else you're losing

1340
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,980
money because they're getting the money

1341
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,619
from people buying your content or from

1342
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,319
the clicks or the ads or what have you

1343
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:50,940
so you both have the emotional and

1344
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,359
privacy violation uh with potential kind

1345
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,059
of physical harm stemming from that and

1346
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,740
you have Financial harm because this is

1347
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,000
tough

1348
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,579
um and so in this work what we have done

1349
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,160
is thus far we've connected uh conducted

1350
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,319
57 interviews

1351
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,359
um with different groups of folks so

1352
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,460
we've done interviews with sex workers

1353
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,520
and with sexters and about half of each

1354
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,140
of our interviews with those groups have

1355
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,720
been with folks who are victim survivors

1356
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,480
of intimate image abuse and then we've

1357
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,660
also spoken with organizations that

1358
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,000
support victim survivors so these are

1359
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,420
organizations that people might turn to

1360
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,180
after they've had images stolen from

1361
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,119
them and the organizations will work

1362
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,480
with them to help support them in

1363
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,520
reporting the content trying to get it

1364
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,040
taken down and they may also provide a

1365
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,599
kind of mental health and other Support

1366
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,099
Services

1367
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:50,040
and our goal in these interviews is to

1368
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,660
understand

1369
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,760
um very much the technological aspects

1370
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,740
so sort of like what technologies are

1371
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,740
people using to create store and share

1372
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,599
their images

1373
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,880
um what are their kind of current

1374
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,480
defense strategies if they have any

1375
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,579
um for these kinds of attacks and then

1376
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,740
what are their dream kind of design

1377
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,480
features how would they like the

1378
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
Technologies to work in order to better

1379
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,400
protect their content and that's

1380
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,140
something that folks sometimes have

1381
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,480
really clear ideas about and other times

1382
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,460
they have really clear concerns but not

1383
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,920
necessarily clear design ideas and

1384
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,579
that's sort of where our role as

1385
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:31,380
researchers is is to come in and try to

1386
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,359
figure out how might we prototype things

1387
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,760
that might work for folks and then we

1388
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,280
come back to the community to do what's

1389
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,440
called participatory design where we

1390
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,500
kind of co-design and co-create tools

1391
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,119
that may be useful and then eventually

1392
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,680
bring in

1393
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,079
um you know technology platforms or

1394
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,940
technology designers to really figure

1395
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,680
out like how do we get this into the

1396
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,540
technology

1397
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,059
and so our results in this project are

1398
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:58,680
sort of still emerging we're still

1399
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,240
actively doing work

1400
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,220
um but I'll share out uh some of the

1401
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,440
highlights that we have so far

1402
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,540
uh the first thing we learned from from

1403
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,000
the 57 interviews we've done is that

1404
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,280
really any technology that you can use

1405
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,640
to send and store images or videos is

1406
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,339
being used for intimate content

1407
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,319
um so this could be anything at all from

1408
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,160
like Dropbox to local storage on a

1409
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,599
device to Discord to kick to very

1410
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,119
specific

1411
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,500
messaging Platforms in a particular

1412
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,020
country to Reddit like anything that you

1413
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,480
can use for image and video capture

1414
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,099
storage and sharing

1415
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:42,240
um folks are using and people are scared

1416
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,680
about

1417
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,619
um you know their fears around having

1418
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,300
intimate image abuse happen are around

1419
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,160
you know embarrassment from things

1420
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,280
coming out being blackmailed being outed

1421
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
this could be outed as a sex worker or

1422
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,460
outed in terms of your sexuality or your

1423
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,900
gender

1424
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,359
um people are afraid of or have been

1425
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,819
doxed and then also of course Financial

1426
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:09,720
loss for folks who are selling their

1427
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,980
images

1428
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,900
and videos

1429
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,520
um and at a high level one of the things

1430
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,099
we see from a technology side is image

1431
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,260
and video data is really treated with

1432
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,960
insufficient sensitivity right so a lot

1433
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,700
of times the protections for image and

1434
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,740
video data are basically the same as

1435
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,220
Text data but image and video shares a

1436
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,980
lot more personal information and has a

1437
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,099
lot more sensitivity particularly given

1438
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,079
um that people aren't kind of using you

1439
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:38,819
know one of three platforms for for

1440
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:40,619
intimate content they're using every

1441
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:42,599
platform and so that means the image and

1442
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,300
video content on every platform is

1443
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,280
sensitive and the re-sharing of that

1444
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,280
content is sensitive

1445
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,040
um and there's this theoretical idea in

1446
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,980
Academia of contextual Integrity which

1447
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,540
is basically that people's kind of

1448
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,300
privacy concerns are very much focused

1449
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,480
on who I shared it with why I shared it

1450
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,980
and

1451
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,140
um what I who I expect to be able to

1452
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,579
receive it outside of who I shared it

1453
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:10,980
with and so this is sort of a perfect

1454
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,160
case study where people are intending to

1455
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,260
share content you know even non-internet

1456
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,900
content with a particular audience and

1457
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,400
then finding it in a completely

1458
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,780
different audience being used

1459
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,119
potentially for a different purpose than

1460
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,540
whatever their intent was originally and

1461
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,700
that's very violating

1462
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,280
so how are people trying to defend

1463
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,720
themselves

1464
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,000
um they are removing identifying

1465
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,099
features from their images so this might

1466
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,079
be face tattoo

1467
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,220
Etc

1468
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,500
um they're also doing screening and

1469
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,880
vetting right colleague kind of

1470
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,680
mentioned screening and betting

1471
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,420
um for in-person work people are doing

1472
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,460
the same thing for sharing images

1473
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,500
they're also kind of creating like

1474
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,260
hierarchies of trust based on how well

1475
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,760
they know someone

1476
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,980
um or know a particular a client or a

1477
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,420
friend or whoever it is or a particular

1478
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,680
group

1479
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,359
um to figure out what they're willing to

1480
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,579
share kind of at different levels of

1481
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:06,900
that trust

1482
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,880
um one of the things that's come up is

1483
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,579
how do I handle kind of expiration right

1484
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,140
sometimes I trust you and then you

1485
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,359
violate my trust there's currently no

1486
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,540
way to really get my content back from

1487
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,359
you right or to kind of continually be

1488
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,220
checking in on on whether I still feel

1489
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,500
the same way about this particular

1490
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,880
sharing

1491
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,220
space or interaction as I did you know

1492
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,920
three months ago uh the other thing that

1493
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,480
that people are doing is is they're

1494
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,240
resigned right they're telling us well I

1495
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,460
just assume that my content is public

1496
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,200
and I just sort of operate with that

1497
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,300
assumption and I'd say there's a lot of

1498
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,700
sort of internalized victim blaming that

1499
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,079
that folks

1500
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,640
um are sort of exhibiting where they're

1501
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,920
like oh well I guess it's my fault you

1502
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,839
know if I choose to share content or I

1503
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,359
choose to to do this kind of Labor

1504
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:55,619
um and that and that sort of victim

1505
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:58,079
living is also in a way encoded in the

1506
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,880
technology right by this sort of

1507
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,859
assumption that like well we're not

1508
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,480
going to do anything to sort of protect

1509
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,700
your content it's just gonna go wherever

1510
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,040
and you know it's your fault if you

1511
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,319
shared it instead of putting the the

1512
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,240
responsibility on the platform for

1513
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,460
saying no you know it's your

1514
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,740
responsibility to make sure my my

1515
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,480
content stays where I shared it which is

1516
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,339
on your platform and not somewhere else

1517
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,559
or in this particular conversation on

1518
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,599
your platform and not somewhere else

1519
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:28,680
Elisa uh so to that end okay we just

1520
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,300
have a couple minutes more for your

1521
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,980
presentation so then we have 15 minutes

1522
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:35,700
for the Q a okay thank you perfect yes

1523
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,380
we're on the last slide

1524
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,020
um so the dream designs

1525
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,020
um that folks had focused around being

1526
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,359
able to automate metadata removal right

1527
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,339
so folks didn't necessarily want people

1528
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:49,799
to be able to look in the metadata for

1529
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:52,500
an image uh or video which you can do

1530
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,260
and see kind of the the location where

1531
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,440
it was taken the time stamp Etc

1532
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,720
um people want this both for privacy and

1533
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,480
also because if you are doing commercial

1534
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,880
work you may want uh clients to think

1535
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,920
that an image was just taken when you

1536
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,299
might have done it as part of a photo

1537
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:12,000
shoot you know a few days ago

1538
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,400
um people also want flexibility in how

1539
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,140
they are able to control their data

1540
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,839
depending on different levels of trust

1541
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:21,420
um they would like content tracking as

1542
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,760
well as detection of content appearing

1543
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,079
elsewhere and notification education

1544
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,700
about that so really trying to kind of

1545
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,640
automate this flow and they would like

1546
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,799
safer storage there really has not been

1547
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,319
a lot of emphasis on tools or platforms

1548
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,299
really to support this use case at all

1549
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:39,900
but particularly to support storage

1550
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,760
um and so I'll close with a quote from

1551
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,500
from one of our participants in this

1552
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,619
work who said I would like to have full

1553
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,540
control on what I'm posting on these

1554
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,180
apps when the elements for controlling

1555
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,200
data appear how uh on a general page or

1556
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,839
a private one uh to I would like to

1557
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,180
protect metadata and ensure that my

1558
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,940
account is safe I would like you know

1559
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,680
one of those options when people can't

1560
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,599
right click on our pictures all of these

1561
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,020
are reasonable and relative many of them

1562
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,299
are relatively simple technical requests

1563
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:15,299
right and so you know what can we do on

1564
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:17,339
this problem what we can do on this

1565
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:20,400
problem is view sex workers and um

1566
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,260
everyone who who creates and shares

1567
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,200
intimate images as stakeholders users

1568
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,480
and creators who have digital rights who

1569
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,579
have privacy needs who have intellectual

1570
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,339
property rights not as you know

1571
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,500
criminals or victims or spam right these

1572
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,480
are stakeholders who are core users of

1573
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,299
your platform and folks who ought to be

1574
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:42,480
uh supported in their rights as users

1575
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,640
and content creators and with that I'll

1576
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,740
hand it back to Luca thank you so much

1577
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,339
Elisa

1578
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,680
and Elisa slides will be available I

1579
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,359
think on the Privacy Camp website they

1580
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,500
were really good slides but we couldn't

1581
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,780
show them so we have a little bit of

1582
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,020
time for a few we do we

1583
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,680
10 minutes

1584
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,380
okay so we have around 20 minutes for

1585
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,420
like either questions to the audience

1586
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,480
and uh to the speakers or comments maybe

1587
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,099
I don't know if there are more mics so I

1588
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,480
give this one

1589
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,099
please raise your hand

1590
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:19,099
um

1591
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,640
hi

1592
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,700
yeah my name is international I have one

1593
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,440
question that I would like to know how

1594
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,200
much you see the growing uh religious

1595
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,540
integrism that is in the U.S now with

1596
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,099
your tax against abortion that's a core

1597
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,780
of a lot of things because it seems that

1598
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,000
a lot of them come from the US and if

1599
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,380
that change depending on the platform

1600
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,819
especially where the platform is from

1601
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,599
oh sorry

1602
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,160
um yeah how much the growing like

1603
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,140
religious integrism that there is now in

1604
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,579
the US and we see the attack against

1605
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:56,460
abortion how much that is at the core of

1606
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,920
the first time sister lows and how much

1607
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,839
does that affect platforms differently

1608
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,780
based on where they are from

1609
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,359
hello yeah okay yeah completely I mean

1610
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:07,500
obviously

1611
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,059
um a lot of the the people that were

1612
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,819
anti-sex work also happen to be

1613
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:14,040
um super pro-family and what about the

1614
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,859
children so I mean yeah we did

1615
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,960
um we did see that as a big impact and

1616
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,460
and obviously whatever is in the states

1617
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,140
people think like oh yeah it's only it's

1618
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,220
only American it's only going to affect

1619
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,079
Americans but it did have a worldwide

1620
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:27,900
impact because I mean uh people were

1621
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,819
allowed to use Backpage all around the

1622
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:31,619
world and actually it was used a lot in

1623
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,599
Europe as well so yeah I would say that

1624
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,799
I mean

1625
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,220
um we did see that big connection and a

1626
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,619
lot of those anti-sex work people also

1627
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,200
happen to be like um anti-abortion it

1628
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,520
kind of seems like all mixed in together

1629
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,980
there also happen to be anti-trends I

1630
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,660
mean like I always I always say that

1631
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,460
it's really impossible to be sex work

1632
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:52,440
exclusionary radical feminists what they

1633
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,059
call themselves

1634
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:55,799
um they think they're radical feminists

1635
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:57,599
and it's impossible to be like a sex

1636
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,400
worker exclusion a radical feminist and

1637
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,500
not be transphobic so then you're also

1638
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,420
kind of a trans exclusionary radical

1639
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,740
feminine or whatever they call

1640
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,480
themselves so yeah swerves and turfs

1641
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,740
kind of go hand in hand and the same

1642
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,920
thing with like people that are um

1643
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,119
anti-abortion also happen to be you know

1644
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,640
I mean they're you're against any of uh

1645
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,799
like a person having

1646
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,079
um uh full

1647
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,880
um capacity over their bodies and

1648
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,920
deciding what they can do so obviously

1649
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,119
it makes sense that those things are

1650
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:25,799
tied I think or Luca you want to say

1651
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,480
something yeah a feeling is like a

1652
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,920
growing amount of evidence about the

1653
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,900
like impact of religious groups and like

1654
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,819
Reproductive Rights in particular you

1655
01:03:32,819 --> 01:03:34,740
know uh right to abortion Etc and

1656
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,240
there's less information about like the

1657
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,619
relation with sexual but we have like

1658
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,599
lots of evidence for example in the UK

1659
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,099
you got an organization called care

1660
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,380
Christian action research and education

1661
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:46,740
which is like a million pound-funded

1662
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,420
religious organization who's doing

1663
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,880
direct lobbying to the UK government and

1664
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,339
for example they were supporting bills

1665
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:54,599
to criminalize the clients of sex

1666
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,640
workers but also pushing for like you

1667
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,680
know repeal of like gay rights or trans

1668
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,900
rights and Reproductive Rights Etc as

1669
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,579
well like Kelly Kelly was saying is that

1670
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,619
it's really shocking for often we put

1671
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,420
the blame on like feminist part of the

1672
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,680
feminist movement when it comes to

1673
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,540
criminalization of sex work in Europe

1674
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,280
and we know that feminist organizations

1675
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,280
have a big impact on in particular the

1676
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,839
Swedish model like the Swedish model is

1677
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,520
the model where clients are criminalized

1678
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,859
in order to abolish prostitution but

1679
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,000
actually we know that these laws

1680
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,260
wouldn't be passed if they were not

1681
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,760
supported by a big part of like

1682
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,980
religious groups and right-wing and

1683
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,559
left-wing uh parties so if you look at

1684
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,500
Ireland for example in Ireland the main

1685
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,819
organization that is providing services

1686
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:34,559
to sex workers currently is called

1687
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,480
ruhama rouhama is a religious

1688
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,059
organization who has the same nuns on

1689
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:40,799
the board than the Magdalene laundries

1690
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,240
so we don't have time to go into

1691
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,980
Magdalene laundries now I don't know if

1692
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,359
you know anything about it Magdalene

1693
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,280
laundries where a religious Institution

1694
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,559
for foreign women during like the

1695
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,000
beginning of the century until the like

1696
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,799
the late 60s I think and they were

1697
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,900
responsible for like lots of traumatic

1698
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,339
like I don't know if you Lawrence you

1699
01:04:56,339 --> 01:04:58,020
want to speak about it like there is

1700
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,400
really like still a very clear link

1701
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,140
between religious institutions such as

1702
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,380
ruhama in Ireland or movement in France

1703
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,020
and many others and other organizations

1704
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,460
that push for criminalization and then

1705
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,900
directly benefit from it because then

1706
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,059
the government makes funding available I

1707
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:13,740
know in France where we are like so loud

1708
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,020
about secularism and basically so

1709
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,359
islamophobic so essentially there's no

1710
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:19,680
problem to work with the Catholic

1711
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,180
organization in order to like

1712
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,220
criminalize sex work and I feel like the

1713
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,599
main one if you want to look into it in

1714
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,359
the U.S if you look at Exodus Cry Exodus

1715
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,780
Cry is unbelievable is this like extreme

1716
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,299
religious organization who does things

1717
01:05:33,299 --> 01:05:34,980
such as purging against trafficking

1718
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,960
where they organize Global prayer

1719
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,400
against trafficking where we also ask

1720
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,380
for donation and then use this money and

1721
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,359
Exodus Cry is one of the actors

1722
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,799
responsible for the whole campaign

1723
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:46,319
against PornHub and what Kelly was

1724
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,359
thinking about only fans like the whole

1725
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,000
push to have MasterCard stopped working

1726
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,579
with only fund for example is by Exodus

1727
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:56,460
Cry and other actors like Ashton or

1728
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,599
whatever his name is Ross

1729
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:13,040
I have been identified already

1730
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,140
you're the processor in this case uh uh

1731
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:20,700
hi I'm lohos from dff and my question is

1732
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:24,299
because uh Luca you mentioned in the at

1733
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:27,780
the beginning the the racist uh origins

1734
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:31,319
of the Abolitionist Movement as well

1735
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:34,680
um how the question of like access to

1736
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,440
digital rights is also uh to be

1737
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,839
differentiated in relation to race but

1738
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,559
then also to to access to uh legal

1739
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,539
documents because a lot of the things

1740
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:48,059
you said also Cali is how people need to

1741
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:49,859
identify and give their passport and

1742
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:51,660
things like that and I just wanted to

1743
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,700
hear more about like how that might also

1744
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,799
be exclusionary to people who can't do

1745
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:59,480
that for obvious reasons

1746
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,020
yeah I mean collection of uh you know ID

1747
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,960
copies and passport it's a real problem

1748
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,680
that we are actually quite against this

1749
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,960
kind of this way of age verification age

1750
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,480
verification is important yes so we all

1751
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,579
agree on that definitely so we want our

1752
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,500
workspaces including online workspaces

1753
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,079
to be as safe as possible

1754
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,940
however there are no different

1755
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,740
ways to verify age at the moment that

1756
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,960
platforms use and you know the easiest

1757
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,380
option to go for is of course let's just

1758
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,539
collect all the data we can and then you

1759
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:41,640
know we can then store this data however

1760
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,440
we want and then we can use this data

1761
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,119
however we want we have no idea how they

1762
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:46,920
do that

1763
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,280
um but it does end up excluding actually

1764
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,640
mostly migrants and uh you know

1765
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,020
individuals who are in the you know

1766
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,359
migration process they may have lost

1767
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,819
their passport you know or they don't

1768
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:01,559
have the right work permit for example

1769
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,160
some platforms even go beyond asking for

1770
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,039
ID copies they ask for work permits like

1771
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:09,480
they want to see your work permit

1772
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,520
especially if you are a person of color

1773
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,980
so if your photo is you know not white

1774
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:17,600
enough they you know have the intense

1775
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,000
incentive to ask more questions like

1776
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,479
this and it is a real problem that

1777
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,000
excludes migrants from basically

1778
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,339
generating income which makes them more

1779
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:32,179
vulnerable than to violence and you know

1780
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,339
then they have to go to pimps you know

1781
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:38,160
or third parties who you know facilitate

1782
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,960
the sex work for them because they can't

1783
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,120
do it by themselves so yeah

1784
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,679
oh yeah so and also again like you said

1785
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:54,319
that this um like different

1786
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,060
differentiated access also to the

1787
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,560
internet one of the things I I didn't

1788
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,479
have enough time because I was being

1789
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,698
pressured um to say during the during

1790
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:04,259
the crisis is that

1791
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:06,660
um also there's a lot of sex workers

1792
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,339
that couldn't access the internet I mean

1793
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,679
because maybe they should or maybe they

1794
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,060
showed a flat where they had you know a

1795
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,100
lot of you know other

1796
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,299
um people they were sharing the fight

1797
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:16,679
with or people that just didn't have

1798
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:19,738
access or the funds to to have these

1799
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,839
platforms but again like you said the

1800
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,380
platforms do require that you be legal

1801
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,880
that whatever that means you

1802
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:27,600
know

1803
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,399
um to be able to access a platform so

1804
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,439
even if we even if we were like for

1805
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,540
example in a country like

1806
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,238
um like Switzerland or Switzerland and

1807
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,819
Brussels Brussels Belgium oh my God

1808
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:40,560
Brussels is a country

1809
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,779
um Belgium or New Zealand where sex

1810
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,359
workers decriminalized you still have to

1811
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,839
be legal to like migration is still

1812
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,339
criminalized so you still have to be

1813
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,738
legal to like able to access those

1814
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:54,600
platform platforms as sex workers so we

1815
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,520
see decriminalization still has it's not

1816
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,140
I mean it's not all that glamorous

1817
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,060
because again it still leaves out the

1818
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,140
most marginalized people which are

1819
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,900
migrants so yeah even in countries

1820
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,860
um like

1821
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,080
um like Belgium or New Zealand still

1822
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,820
have this problem again you know like

1823
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,500
even if you have only fans or many vids

1824
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,699
you can't have it unless you have a um a

1825
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:17,400
passport that's uh in Vigor or a work

1826
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,480
permit

1827
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,980
we're having like this in some of the

1828
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,840
reports like so mentioning here we have

1829
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,060
a couple of reports on a privacy and

1830
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:27,420
censorship uh written by eswa and I feel

1831
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,860
like there was some specific example of

1832
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,659
undocumented migrants who want to be

1833
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,460
able to advertise in a country like the

1834
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,199
UK for example so in the UK you have a

1835
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,060
main platform called adult work where

1836
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,980
tens of thousands of sex talkers are

1837
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,320
advertising and it's the main way to

1838
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,760
make an income if you work in the sex

1839
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,320
industry in the UK at least like on

1840
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,300
digital platform and undocumented

1841
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,340
migrants need to find a way to advertise

1842
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,140
there so what they would do some of them

1843
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,820
would find a third party and say like

1844
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,260
you know what I'll do it for you I'll

1845
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,239
find a way to hack the system to use a

1846
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,880
fake ID Etc but I'm going to take 30 of

1847
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,739
your income and I will decide this

1848
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:00,840
information on your platform your rates

1849
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,000
for example when you work etc and we are

1850
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,380
talking with sex okay we're saying like

1851
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,880
we're not able to get out of this

1852
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,440
because I only wanted to sell sex for a

1853
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,880
few months and now my advertisement is

1854
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,860
still there and I'm still receiving fun

1855
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,140
Etc from clients Etc so I think there's

1856
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,060
a real issue where all these laws even

1857
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,860
the laws that are like defined as like

1858
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,540
trafficking or in Germany the price

1859
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,520
Institute prostitution protection act

1860
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,199
all these law are designed to protect

1861
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:23,580
sex workers but I've never developed

1862
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,199
with sex workers and in particular with

1863
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,780
marginalized migrant racialized lgbtqi

1864
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,760
sex workers were more at risk and often

1865
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,199
this law that are meant to protect us

1866
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,940
without talking to us in the first place

1867
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,040
actually making us more vulnerable and

1868
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,600
more at risk of exploitation by Third

1869
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,340
parties in particular and there's a lot

1870
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,900
of similarity with like many of the

1871
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,980
discussions we have around like

1872
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,080
undocumented migrants in general if you

1873
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,699
want undocumented migrants to be safe

1874
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:46,500
just make it easier for migrants to come

1875
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,420
here there is no other way for migrants

1876
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,640
to be safe making it more difficult by

1877
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,159
you know creating like more like less

1878
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,020
Pathways to come to Europe in particular

1879
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,760
will make it like more risky for

1880
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,440
migrants and it's exactly the same for

1881
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,759
sex workers and platforms

1882
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,739
[Applause]

1883
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,120
there's a few more questions just one

1884
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,960
more one more

1885
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,400
please identify yourself too much yeah

1886
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,460
okay hi I'm Ali sibai from uh

1887
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,159
uh I just want to ask if since like

1888
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,860
during the covert pandemic

1889
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,860
again since sex workers have adapted or

1890
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,020
adopted a

1891
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,260
online tools more often so did this

1892
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:38,760
actually

1893
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,580
facilitated law enforcement Crackdown on

1894
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,400
sex workers through using tracking them

1895
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,080
through iptu location or like did this

1896
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,179
happen like help law enforcement or

1897
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,100
facilitated for law enforcement to do

1898
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,460
Crackdown on sex workers as a deputants

1899
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,300
of sex anti-sex trafficking and so on

1900
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,140
follow-up question new advice like

1901
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,000
sexual workers to use like vpns to

1902
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,400
protect their geolocation and so on

1903
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,500
thank you

1904
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,580
if it's the last question we can take

1905
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,900
and then we try to respond so

1906
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,780
hello my name is vitaria I'm an activist

1907
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,000
from Brazil and my question is also to

1908
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,040
collect maybe perspectives on how we

1909
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,679
could create financial instruments to

1910
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,780
not fill in these lives of these persons

1911
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,519
but also filling out movements

1912
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,360
sorry I'm not sure I understood the

1913
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,599
question

1914
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,679
it's a way how you could create

1915
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:42,980
financial instruments to make the money

1916
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:45,840
flows to these persons but also filling

1917
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,000
our movements like discriminalize

1918
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,360
abortion sexual worker and so on

1919
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,159
by creating financial instruments that

1920
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:54,840
don't rely you want to answer the police

1921
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,239
Elisa did you hear the question as well

1922
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:00,659
okay yes so I give you basically uh you

1923
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:02,460
can all say a few words either directly

1924
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,960
responding to the question or final word

1925
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,159
that you might have wanted to say on the

1926
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:06,600
dance and then we can close the

1927
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,420
financial instruments yeah I'll just

1928
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,340
quickly respond to that I mean it's

1929
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,360
really hard because the terms of

1930
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,239
services are super anti-sex work so if

1931
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:16,380
there's somebody with a lot of money

1932
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,300
that wants to create an app that's sex

1933
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,460
worker friendly or if not I mean one of

1934
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,020
the things that I've been doing as a

1935
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,179
survival based sex work is just finding

1936
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:26,640
somebody a third person a very good

1937
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,540
friend who would be able to accept

1938
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,300
payments for me and use their ID and

1939
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,219
their like PayPal account or whatever

1940
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:34,020
although I have got my friend's PayPal

1941
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,460
account shut down by accident even

1942
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,260
though I didn't say anything about sex

1943
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,760
work I just said English lessons and

1944
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,620
still got shut down so finding third

1945
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:43,320
third parties I mean isn't the isn't the

1946
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,880
kind of solution but that's what I've

1947
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,080
been doing because I haven't been able

1948
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,600
to find an app that's actually

1949
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,520
um that I don't violate the terms of

1950
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,780
service so you're always kind of like

1951
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,920
you know

1952
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,420
um trying to jump from app to app and

1953
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,219
not try to keep too much money in any of

1954
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:58,320
the apps if you doing Digital Sex work

1955
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,120
but yeah I don't know if there's anybody

1956
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,159
here that has a better a better solution

1957
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,299
but that's what I'm doing for now

1958
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,560
um I can answer if we are suggesting sex

1959
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,659
Works to use VPN and stuff like this so

1960
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:14,219
digital security is of course the

1961
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:16,440
important part of uh you know it's one

1962
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,900
of the ways I think to uh try to fight

1963
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,860
back uh and I do personally find them

1964
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:26,100
important but uh you know there are lots

1965
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,080
of things to consider so are these tools

1966
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,120
are accessible enough for example are

1967
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,760
they cheap enough are they uh you know

1968
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,040
do they have multiple languages are they

1969
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,540
you know easy to navigate

1970
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:40,320
so these are all important uh and it

1971
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,780
does leave some sex workers out of these

1972
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:44,540
systems basically

1973
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,940
but also I feel like technology changes

1974
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,120
really passed and you know uh

1975
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,920
you know technological artifacts are

1976
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,500
always you know reimagined and you know

1977
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,440
people find ways around Technologies you

1978
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,199
know to overcome the barriers they

1979
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,500
basically present so I don't think it's

1980
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,140
a absolute solution to just rely on

1981
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,179
digital security because you know these

1982
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:11,159
technologies will change people will

1983
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,380
find other ways to you know interfere

1984
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:15,120
with your Communications and stuff like

1985
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:19,560
this so I personally think policy is

1986
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,800
should be really you know

1987
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,280
really really the fundamental thing to

1988
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:30,060
do for us so we should base all our

1989
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,980
policies on fundamental protecting

1990
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,380
fundamental human rights and then just

1991
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,900
let the technology evolve around these

1992
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,820
policies

1993
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,360
thank you and

1994
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,060
yes I'll address

1995
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,239
um the the technical security tools so

1996
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,219
um in a survey of about a hundred

1997
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,739
workers in in Europe

1998
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:54,540
um what we saw was the the primary

1999
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:56,580
security tool that people were using not

2000
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,440
always necessarily for security purposes

2001
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,480
but sometimes for that reason uh with

2002
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,100
encrypted chat so about a third of

2003
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,739
people were using encrypted chat tools

2004
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:07,980
only about 15 of people were using

2005
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:10,040
um vpns and then about five percent

2006
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,239
reusing cryptocurrency

2007
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,520
um and I think we have kind of uh

2008
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,260
there's sort of two reasons for that so

2009
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:18,780
one reason that folks are not always

2010
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,580
using sort of these technical security

2011
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,159
tools and is well put by one of our

2012
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,500
participants who said I would gladly do

2013
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,719
all of the above but that really only

2014
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:30,300
works when the customers participate and

2015
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:33,179
they said you know threema signal pgp

2016
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,400
encryption cryptocurrency right I could

2017
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,219
know more sort of demand that the max

2018
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:41,219
Punk Society pay me in cryptocurrency uh

2019
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:43,020
than many workers can can demand that

2020
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:45,480
their clients do so and clients may not

2021
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,719
want to do so for a variety of reasons

2022
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:50,580
that doesn't necessarily mean that

2023
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,040
cryptocurrencies can't be useful in some

2024
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,320
way but at least in the current way that

2025
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,940
they are built right a you're opting

2026
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,800
into a different currency system it has

2027
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,800
interoperability payment issues as well

2028
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,080
as just usability issues and it has to

2029
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,600
be cooperative with clients and then for

2030
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,120
things like vpns while this can be

2031
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,000
useful as a privacy protection certainly

2032
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,860
there is this kind of usability

2033
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:16,500
trade-off of like using a VPN doesn't

2034
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,020
change the fact uh to Kelly's point that

2035
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,600
the terms of service are very

2036
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,040
um you know kind of to the first

2037
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,840
question in the panel american-centric

2038
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,179
and sort of with these particular set of

2039
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:29,219
moral values

2040
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:31,199
um that prevent people from using them

2041
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,480
right and so I can use a VPN but that

2042
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,000
doesn't really change what can I can do

2043
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,800
with tools and so I think for a lot of

2044
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,980
people that kind of utility uh cost

2045
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,900
trade-off of using some of these tools

2046
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,699
just isn't high enough and they're not

2047
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:47,159
addressing people's like core needs and

2048
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:48,420
concerns

2049
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,360
thank you so much Elisa and uh I wanted

2050
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,820
to say like a few words to conclude uh

2051
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,860
like many things were said just on the

2052
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,500
point of like banking sex workers uh

2053
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,900
I've often organized in relation to this

2054
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,280
crisis for many years if you look at

2055
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,500
India for example sex workers were not

2056
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,179
able to access financial institution the

2057
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:07,380
bank would say we don't take your money

2058
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,239
your sex worker is probably coming from

2059
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,040
trafficking we don't want it so sex talk

2060
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,719
has created their own bank which now has

2061
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,820
tens of thousands of members and able to

2062
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,159
like save money and do micro credits to

2063
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:18,659
support one another and this is

2064
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:19,860
something that sex talkers have always

2065
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,380
done creating Mutual Aid support so that

2066
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,780
we have we are protecting each other I

2067
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,159
want you to say a couple of things we

2068
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,840
have resources here we also have these

2069
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,159
t-shirts that's why I always wear these

2070
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:30,659
T-shirts if you want to buy one of them

2071
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:33,480
it's helping us sex workers and our

2072
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,179
organization like work in very

2073
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:37,320
precarious environment is very difficult

2074
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,080
for us to access spaces political spaces

2075
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,640
but also resources so we really

2076
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,440
encourage you if you are able to support

2077
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,120
sex local rights organization at the

2078
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,100
local or european level or International

2079
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,560
level please do so you know reach out to

2080
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,300
us and I wanted to finish with one thing

2081
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,440
that we are working on we are very

2082
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,540
excited about with different partners

2083
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,880
including edree and freedom

2084
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,400
collaborative and hopefully Elisa and

2085
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,380
Max Planck Institute as well I think

2086
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,120
lots of the things that we said is often

2087
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:04,020
that

2088
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:06,020
foreign

2089
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:09,239
debates had been based on this idea that

2090
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:10,440
on one hand you got victims of

2091
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,000
trafficking or other victims and on the

2092
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,679
other hand you got sex workers and

2093
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,360
somehow it's not possible to get rights

2094
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,920
for these two communities but we know

2095
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,480
this is not true because many of us are

2096
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,040
victims whether we are victims of

2097
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,840
gender-based violence we are victim of

2098
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,640
intimate image based abuse as we discuss

2099
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,620
victim of exploitation or trafficking

2100
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,300
there is no such thing as like two

2101
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,040
different communities many sex workers

2102
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,080
are victims have been victims or will be

2103
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,580
victims at some point and what we want

2104
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,840
to create is more dialogue between

2105
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,760
different organizations that might not

2106
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,199
have the same priorities or the same

2107
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,820
strategies but should have more

2108
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,980
conversation about how we create in

2109
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,600
particular digital landscape digital

2110
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,760
environment that both protect the rights

2111
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,800
of sex workers to sales sex to advertise

2112
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,840
to express themselves but also protect

2113
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,520
the rights of victims including children

2114
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,560
including victims of intimate major

2115
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,020
abuse and sexual exploitation so to do

2116
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:55,980
this we are creating this

2117
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,659
multi-stakeholder dialogue which will

2118
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:00,360
bring together different actors Civil

2119
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,199
Society policy makers sex workers take

2120
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,159
imagining some organization that never

2121
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:06,540
come together in the same room to

2122
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:08,699
discuss on how we can create this and as

2123
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:09,840
that's the thing that I've heard

2124
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,580
throughout the day is that it is

2125
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,460
possible to imagine new structure new

2126
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,140
design but also new realities we already

2127
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,360
talk about prison abolition you know

2128
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,340
abolitional border or new structure that

2129
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,739
allows sex workers to exist freely

2130
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:24,960
without fear of repression so thank you

2131
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,699
for your support and have a great day

2132
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,440
bye
