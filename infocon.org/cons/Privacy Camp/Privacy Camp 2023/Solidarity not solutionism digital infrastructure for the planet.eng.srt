joining us from all sorts of different

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,540
geographic regions of the world hello

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,479

27
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,159
format experiment so please bear with us

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,439

um this really great way to actually

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,640
hear from voices from all over today

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,820
um this panel is kind of a follow-on to

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,520
a workshop that just happened which

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,680
began to explore environmental and

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,540
climate Justice as a digital rights

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,759
issue

36
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,520
this panel now is going to be focusing

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
on the idea of false solutions for

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,180
climate and false Tech Solutions in

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,820
particular

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,640
just a word about myself

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,380

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,940
use of data and Technology

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,379

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,080
panelists based in Chile Bulgaria

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Germany and here in Brussels with me on

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,239
stage

54
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,260
um

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,860

independent activist and researcher and

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,000
with the Latin American Institute for

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
terraforming

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,099
uh Lily fur is joining us from from the

60
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,840
center for international environmental

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,940
law

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Plum and pave of Blue Link Bulgaria is

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,660
also here with us and narmeen Abu bakari

64
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,879
from the EU greens

65
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,819
they will introduce their work and how

66
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,560
they've come to this discussion of uh

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,659
environmental justice uh very briefly

68
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,959
but first we just want to thank adri and

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879
privacy camp for hosting this

70
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,379
conversation

71
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,140
um because uh it's part of an effort to

72
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,000
think about how we can Center climate

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,159
and environmental issues in digital

74
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,060
rights discussions

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,480
so um in terms of uh this Workshop that

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,099
I just came out of

77
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,500
what we saw there is

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,480
um that environmental justice and

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,180
climate Justice intersect with digital

80
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,620
rights issues in a number of different

81
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,940
ways one key point is on surveillance

82
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,459
and security of movements and lands

83
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,099
rights Defenders

84
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,319
who are put into Harm's Way and are

85
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,959
dealing with safety concerns as they

86
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,159
arise through digital means

87
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,080
there's also a concern with information

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,299
and disinformation which connects

89
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,000
digital rights and climate Justice

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,459
concerns and there's also a common

91
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,500
shared concern around the extractive

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,579
nature of corporate technology practices

93
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,740
and in Europe we see this clear

94
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,419
interlinking happening with the

95
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,880
discourse around the twin transition

96
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,580
which is the idea that sustainability

97
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,919
can be supported through digitization

98
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,020
and digital Innovation something which

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,540
which narmine also touched on just

100
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,060
before our panel

101
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,919
um the question is is it always true

102
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,919
that sustainability and digitization are

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,900
mutually supporting

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,080
there is a lot to unpack there uh with

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,720
this idea

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,880
and it's a question that seems fit for

107
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,220
the digital rights uh communities around

108
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,759
the world to take stock of

109
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,740
the digital rights Community is of

110
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,600
course very familiar with the need to be

111
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,180
critical about what kind of innovation

112
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,720
gets supported and invested into but

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,280
um Shawna and I and the rest of the

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,259
panelists here today believe there's a

115
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,300
lot we can also learn from the climate

116
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,400
Justice movement on how to resist

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,120
solutionism as a common concern

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
so on this panel we're calling out

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,620
techno solutionism at the intersection

120
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,900
of these different issues

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,840
and we're taking inspiration from a

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,300
framing that the Justice climate Justice

123
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,560
movement uses which is false climate

124
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
Solutions Technologies and narratives

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
that can distract from the problem we're

126
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,560
trying to solve and potentially even

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,180
make it worse

128
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,280
we're asking what are the false

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,139
solutions that the digital rights sphere

130
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,880
needs to be aware of

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,060
and we're also asking what are some of

132
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,820
the just Pathways that already exist and

133
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,639
which can be which we can way fine

134
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,979
together in order to solve climate and

135
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,000
environmental crises

136
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,500
um so just a little note on the hybrid

137
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,180
format today

138
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,080
um uh we encourage the audience here as

139
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,380
well as online to use the hashtag

140

throughout the panel there will be a

143
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,680
time to discuss those at the end

144

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,400
environmental and climate Justice

165
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,620
thanks Becky I made the design very

166
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,419

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,400
hear what's bringing everyone in the

173
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,259
audience and participating online to

174
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,300
this conversation

175
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,280
um as as Becky said this has been a

176
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,900
conversation that's been happening for

177
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,520
some time and we really wanted to be

178
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,620
something that continues well beyond

179
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,479
just this moment that we're having today

180
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,520
at privacy Camp

181
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,020
um as Becky said I work with the

182
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,520
association for Progressive

183
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,259
Communications which is an international

184
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,800
network of Civil Society organizations

185
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,419
that are really dedicated to supporting

186
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,020
individuals and groups to use technology

187
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,940
for care for ourselves each other and

188
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,580
the planet and environmental justice and

189
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,500
sustainability really is at the heart of

190
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,860
ABC since APC was founded in 1990

191
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,379
however there's been really A Renewed

192
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,900
focus on environmental justice in the

193
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,660
last few years including a publication

194
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,639
called the Global Information Society

195
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,460
watch gizwatch published an addition in

196
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,039
2021 really focusing on this issue and I

197
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,799
know for myself it was incredibly

198
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,899
valuable to see just these really

199
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,179
grounded perspectives of what was

200
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,580
happening with ABC members and allies

201
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,580
and communities that that ABC network is

202
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,080
working with in terms of the real

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,899
impacts of the climate crises and the

204
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,940
ways that digital Technologies are are

205
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,160
very much intersecting with these crises

206
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,800
so

207
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
as part of that work APC has also been

208
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,680
looking at ways in which we can support

209
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,000
environmental justice movements and land

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,940
Defenders and this conversation around

211
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,339
false Solutions has come up time and

212
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,260
again and I think we're really looking

213
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,720
to how can we resist those false

214
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,279
Solutions and what are the opportunities

215
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,820
to as Becky side said we find those

216
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,880
those just Pathways so that's part of

217
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
what brings me to this conversation and

218
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,899
I'm really excited to hear from the

219
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,060
other the other speakers so I'll pass

220
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,800
back to you first Becky in kisses

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,320
anything else you want to add

222
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,959
no thank you so much Shawna

223
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,480
um in that case uh narmeen if I can pass

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,399
it to you nermeen how did you come to

225
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,160
the this intersection of issues and tell

226
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,380
us a little bit about what you work on

227
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,959
so um I work for the greens at the

228
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,440
European Parliament so for um elected

229
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,899
representative I was First Data

230
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,940
protection legal council before so I

231
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,040
really focused on basically I did that

232
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,540
protection

233
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,160
um and then after that I worked for a

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,920
consultation consultancy agency really

235
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,800
focusing on sustainability in Tech as

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,220
much as data protection and I've

237
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,080
realized that the question of

238
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
sustainability was mainly taken into

239
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,140
account by companies but because the

240
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,779
climate movement was influencing the

241
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,700
discussion so they were extremely scared

242
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,000
of the legislative steps that was taking

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,560
place in Brussels

244
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,839
and then I changed job and worked for

245
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,519
the greens where I was the digital

246
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,820
rights campaigner and I work on digital

247
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,959
rights as much as climate issues and

248
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,000
this is where my work really focused on

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,519
writer repair circular economy but also

250
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
environmental impact of different type

251
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,279
of Technologies and this is where also

252
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,399
it was more of an activism

253
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,320
role that I had because as a campaigner

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,360
obviously I can be on behalf of the

255
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,820
Queens for a better solution for our

256
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,720
attack infrastructures and products

257
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
um what up thank you Becky thank you

258
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,740
uh next I'd love to hear from Paz

259
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,740
Paz can you hear me hi everyone yes I

260
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,420
can hear you

261
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,940
um hello everyone my name is past Pena

262
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,579
and I live in Santiago of Chile I work

263
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,399
as a freelance consultant and for the

264
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
last I would say five years I have been

265
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
researching the intersections between

266
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,360
digital technology and the climate and

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,579
environmental crisis and I'm

268
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,200
particularly interested in the social

269
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,060
environmental conflicts of digitization

270
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,100
and it's your political effects

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,079
especially in Latin America

272
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,320
in this sense I work on the you know on

273
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,180
the exploitation of nature by

274
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,579
digitization as well as the displacement

275
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,680
and social environmental impacts

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,779
experienced by indigenous populations

277
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,399
and of course the working class so my

278
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,220
special interest in the issue of false

279
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,200
solution has to do not only with the

280
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
size systemic effects of digitization in

281
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,720
the increase of consumption and energy

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,880
use but also with how this supposed

283
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,820
Solutions are built at the cost of the

284
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,100
lives of human and non-humans in a

285
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
particular situation of vulnerability no

286
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,660
so in other words what are the

287
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,480
communities paying the price of the GT

288
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,220
session as a solution for the climate

289
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,260
and environmental crisis thank you very

290
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,160
much

291
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,800
thank you so much pause

292
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,560
um Plum and tell us about your work

293
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,859
please

294
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,019
and I'm working for the

295
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,800
boring Foundation Bulgaria but as we are

296
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
Global Foundation you know in many

297
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
aspects in terms of our interest mostly

298
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,480
I'm based in Estonia and I'm

299
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,820
Environmental Lawyer for more than 20

300
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,680
years and we have been working with APC

301
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
and also

302
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,820
with other organizations on the network

303
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,440
internet

304
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,200
governance but also networking with

305
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,300
environmental and social uh social

306
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,600
rights and other human rights activists

307
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,519
so that we could bring together all the

308
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,600
perspectives where it comes to the point

309
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,480
when we need to move forward with the

310
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,240
Technical Solutions and then also the

311
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,060
impacts of these Solutions

312
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,120
across various Fields

313
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,680
my my perspective has been in a way

314
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,360
limited to the environmental field for

315
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,240
many years but since we have been

316
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,660
working with the APC on different issues

317
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,779
especially on the taxation between

318
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,500
digital and environmental rights and the

319
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,620
possible potential for exploring the

320
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,660
potential for their Mutual reinforcement

321
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,480
that brought me a bit further out of

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,079
this style of

323
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,019
Environmental Protection work in terms

324
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,200
of law policies and also people behind

325
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,800
and to see how we could

326
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,160
mutually support with with the tools

327
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,399
with experience with the stories we have

328
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,779
been through in our work so there's a

329
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,000
lot of to learn from each other

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,339
and there's a lot we don't know about

331
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,820
each other so it has been really maybe

332
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,399
at the beginning of the journey is for

333
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,220
me because

334
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,760
in the in the past years I had one

335
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,519
not much but I'm trying to learn much

336
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,100
more so that we could help each other

337
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,620
and find ways because there are many

338
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,199
challenges uh even with with the good

339
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,660
Solutions related to the

340
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,000
climate change with the for example of

341
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,920
European green deal and just

342
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,260
transitional there are many social and

343
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,199
other issues technological mostly also

344
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,360
which should be considered so there is a

345
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
a lot of debate and a lot of uh

346
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,040
playing field in this regard so to be a

347
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,800
part of this thank you

348
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,540
thank you plumbing and what we'll hear

349
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,860
more about uh specifically what kinds of

350
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,420
Frameworks and just Pathways you're

351
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,660
looking at and very last but very not

352
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,480
least uh Lily please tell us about your

353
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,519
work

354
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,139
hello everyone

355
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,540
um yeah I'm Lily four I'm Journey from

356
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,399
Berlin Germany and I work with the

357
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
center for international environmental

358
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,540
law an international NGO that works at

359
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,399
the intersection of the environment and

360
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,199
human rights I'm not a lawyer I should

361
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,779
say many people expect that I'm a lawyer

362
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,600
we have many lawyers I'm not one of them

363
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,940
um I've only been with Ciel for the last

364
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,940
half year and and and I think a lot of

365
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,740
what I've done before then also brings

366
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,600
me to this conversation

367
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,899
um today for um 16 years I worked for

368
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,560
the German green Henry's bow foundation

369
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
on International environmental policies

370
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,920
um focusing very much at the

371
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,740
intersection of the environment and new

372
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,680
and emerging disruptive Technologies and

373
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,300
I've also been sitting on the board of

374
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,760
an NGO that is very instrumental in the

375
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,399
social movement space on this topic uh

376
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,279
the ETC group or Etc group that monitors

377
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,740
new and emerging Technologies in this

378
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,579
space

379
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,639
and and I you know I can that the

380
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,920
streams that you've already mentioned

381
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,540
Becky that came out of your Workshop

382
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,579
very much resonate with

383
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,380
um sort of the the way that I've been

384
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,480
looking at this topic and where I'm

385
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,519
coming from the surveillance the

386
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,880
extractive nature of corporate practices

387
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
um but in addition so I've always been

388
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,139
interested at this intersection of or

389
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,000
we're basically powerful corporate

390
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,459
interests on the side of big polluters

391
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,619
fossil fuel Industries big agriculture

392
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,079
on the one hand and then big Tech and

393
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,319
Big Data where they where they um

394
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,260
polite or you know where they come

395
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,439
together and and intersect and maybe the

396
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,720
other few things just to mention

397
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
um where where you know that that

398
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,020
concern might work whether it's

399
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,040
happening is really where big um tech

400
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,720
companies and entrepreneurs with that

401
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,540
Tech solutionist mindset

402
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,540
um begin to implement so-called uh

403
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,059
solutions to The Climate crisis

404
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,160
um for example geoengineering which I

405
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,720
hope we can speak more about later

406
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,900
um and yeah also very much the impact of

407
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,400
the environmental impact of these

408
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Technologies as passes mentioned their

409
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,780
massive energy consumption I think leads

410
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,200
to a big uh colliding of interest and um

411
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
then

412
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,820
one other thing that I just wanted to to

413
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,900
flag

414
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,660
because I think that's something that

415
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,039
I've worked on for a long time but

416
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,020
that's not very much the Forefront of

417
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,080
this discussion is where um big

418
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,780
companies in the agriculture space

419
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,640
um are beginning to really go for a big

420
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,640
data grab to grab what is now called

421
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,419
digital sequence information so

422
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,160
digitalized information about genetics

423
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,940
of plants and species to really exploit

424
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,200
them for their private profits it's a

425
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,059
huge topic that is also being discussed

426
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,039
at the UN level I think it's something

427
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,440
to explore much more from a digital

428
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,140
rights perspective and a question of how

429
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,500
we deal with big data so um yeah very

430
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,720
happy to be here and and there's lots to

431
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,039
discuss

432
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
thank you very much Lily and we

433
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,240
appreciate your perspective on Climate

434
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,179
Technologies because the folks in this

435
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,679
room and in the digital rights space

436
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,320
were accustomed to focusing on digital

437
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,720
Technologies and now thinking about

438
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
their intersections with climate and

439
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,440
environment there's also of course

440
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,960
a lot of a long history of climate

441
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,480
technology

442
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,360
there's a un mechanism for a transfer of

443
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,059
technology and exploration of carbon

444
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,220
capture and geoengineering so we're

445
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,720
really eager to hear more about that

446
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,360
history and your perspective on how this

447
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,880
these discussions and Investments have

448
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,640
changed over the years

449
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,820
um so with those uh introductions I now

450
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,220
want to move us to the first part of

451
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,140
this discussion the first part of the

452
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,299
discussion uh that we're going to have

453
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,880
together is around calling out false

454
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
climate Solutions and thinking about

455
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,919
what these actually are in relation to

456
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,320
digital rights concerns and then after

457
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,620
that um Shauna is going to take us

458
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,960
through thinking about these just

459
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,200
Pathways so

460
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,299
um just to come back to what what do we

461
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,980
mean by false solution and why is this

462
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,280
relevant for digital rights folks one

463
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,260
example that has come up a lot in our

464
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,679
discussions so far is around carbon

465
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,419
offsetting

466
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,440
so carbon offsetting is a practice that

467
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,140
first or Rose in 1988 as part of What's

468
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
called the voluntary carbon market and

469
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,700
it's a way to

470
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,419
um

471
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,120
for institutions companies and also

472
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,840
individuals to think about their carbon

473
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
consumption and try to compensate for it

474
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,280
either by through a forestation efforts

475
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,100
such as planting trees or restoring

476
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,240
ecosystems and over the decades it's

477
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,580
become a less popular idea and a more

478
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,580
popular idea also tool and Technology we

479
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,960
can think of it as a climate technology

480
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,820
as well

481
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,260
um what's interesting is at the moment

482
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,419
there's a lot of renewed interest in

483
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,780
carbon offsetting and when it comes to

484
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,179
the digital rights space

485
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,100
um this is this is where I would like to

486
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,020
tie it back to some research that we at

487
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,120
the engine room worked on for the last

488
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,059
year and a half uh what we did uh

489
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,320
together uh in in our organization was a

490
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,360
research project exploring intersections

491
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,520
between climate Justice and digital

492
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,799
rights and as part of this we looked at

493
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,220
corporate Tech practices for both big

494
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,520
Tech corporations and smaller players

495
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,100
also in the commercial space and what we

496
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,700
saw often is that there are very

497
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,280
expansive pledges made by companies

498
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,200
around climate and sustainability

499
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,780
targets but not a lot of information

500
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,360
about what's actually happening Behind

501
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,860
These pledges

502
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,799
what we do know is that one of the most

503
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,700
common tools that is used to kind of

504
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,900
achieve Net Zero so to speak is a carbon

505
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,340
offsetting

506
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,900
uh there are other tools include

507
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,080
renewable energy credits and also

508
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,000
discussions of infrastructural

509
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
efficiency

510
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,179
Etc but carbon offsets this is um what

511
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,940
we think is a false solution it's been

512
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,860
called out by the climate Justice

513
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,919
movement for decades more recently we

514
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,840
also have increased empirical evidence

515
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
for example a study came out last week

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,760
or an investigation rather which

517
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,919
collected a number of studies and also

518
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,620
pulled in New Evidence which showed that

519
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,679
at least 95 percent of carbon offsets in

520
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,919
the end do nothing to offset carbon

521
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,059
emissions

522
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,640
these projects often fail

523
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,820
and Beyond the failure of individual

524
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,799
projects there's also the larger problem

525
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,860
of this idea that it's okay to do harm

526
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,020
in one side of the or one part of the

527
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,980
world

528
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,159
if you compensate for it in another part

529
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,799
it turns out that ecology and the

530
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,080
ecosystem doesn't work that way it's not

531
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,659
a balance sheet where you can just you

532
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,220
know balance the budget and everything

533
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,020
will be okay

534
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,059
that really calls a lot into question

535
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,380
about big Tech and it makes us ask as a

536
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,419
group of people practitioners exploring

537
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,220
intersections of climate and digital

538
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,260
rights what does that mean for digital

539
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,659
rights advocacy and efforts to already

540
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:24,780
try to hold companies accountable

541
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,960
is this concern with climate pledges

542
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,940
something that should be integrated with

543
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,640
concern around other kinds of digital

544
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,500
rights Harms

545
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,900
so with that provocation I now want to

546
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,159
move to

547
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,000
um

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,980
uh to Lily

549
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,039
and to ask Lily to reflect a bit about

550
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,100
this history of climate technology and

551
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,520
what it brings us to today what should

552
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,120
digital rights folks be aware of as the

553
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,039
space becomes increasingly involved on

554
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,299
sustainability and climate issues Lily

555
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,640
thank you and thank you for that

556
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,080
provocation

557
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,360
um that was already great and so I

558
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,580
thought what I could offer is

559
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,460
um looking back at when I was 30 years

560
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,320
basically of international climate

561
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,539
policy making looking a little bit back

562
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,640
at the different turns that we've taken

563
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,559
along the way that have led us down a

564
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,120
lot of wrong past

565
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,100
um and that is that have increasingly

566
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,380
narrowed down our sinking to just a few

567
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,120
options

568
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,679
um basically ruling out other

569
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,840
alternative options and Pathways that we

570
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,940
could have taken because I do think they

571
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,500
want really want everyone to keep that

572
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,020
in mind that when we talk about

573
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,940
Solutions the key question is really

574
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,740
what is the problem we're trying to

575
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,140
address right depending on how we Define

576
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,960
a problem the kinds of solutions that

577
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,520
we're going to look for are going to

578
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,500
look different you know people you know

579
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,600
with a techno fixed mindset usually come

580
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
with a solution and then they look for a

581
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,960
problem to solve let's do it the other

582
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,000
way around let's look for what is the

583
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,500
problem and then

584
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,240
um you know what's the solution and

585
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,860
looking back really two of the driving

586
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,200
forces along the entire

587
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,840
pathway of four Solutions in the last 30

588
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,120
years have been the believe in Endless

589
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,940
economic growth on a finite planet

590
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,360
um you know followed by neoliberal

591
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,760
capitalism basically and then

592
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,720
um also this uh techno optimism and the

593
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,159
belief that Technologies can fix

594
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,740
anything and Innovation will be the

595
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,600
solution and

596
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,320
um so along along just just outlining a

597
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,720
few of those terms where we have maybe

598
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,380
taken the wrong turn when in 1992 the

599
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,940
world agreed on the U.N framework

600
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,679
convention on climate change right the

601
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,360
UNF Triple C

602
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,380
we decided you know collectively people

603
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,480
in that convention back then that the

604
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,980
climate problem was going to be framed

605
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,080
as one about emissions in the atmosphere

606
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,480
something very abstract not to do with

607
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,279
people's life it's somewhere up there

608
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,440
you know a thing you cannot touch its

609
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,460
emissions

610
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,659
and the solution was going to be

611
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,220
emission reductions

612
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,840
well we could have decided the problem

613
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,580
was the fossil fuels in the ground that

614
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,919
we were burning you know and the forests

615
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,960
that we were cutting down

616
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,700
that's not what we decided the problem

617
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,580
was emission reductions and then and

618
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,400
then came the Kyoto Protocol which you

619
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,100
know decided on some first concrete very

620
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,320
small but targeted measures to actually

621
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,179
reduce emissions for a few countries the

622
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,440
rich countries

623
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,140
and what we decided then was gonna was

624
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,860
that one ton of carbon that that is

625
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,659
emitted when you burn

626
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,960
coal for example or oil or gas is

627
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,779
equivalent to one ton of carbon that is

628
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,360
sequestered in a tree or an ecosystem or

629
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,000
you know soil

630
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,220
that is actually very flawed because

631
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,900
they're very different carbon Cycles you

632
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,760
can ask in ecologist the biologists they

633
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,340
will explain because those Cycles have

634
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,700
different timelines and um so it does

635
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,460
matter a lot also the the geographical

636
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,740
location matters the question whether

637
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,659
you're locking in a coal mine or cutting

638
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,080
out an entire Forest matters so one ton

639
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,120
of carbon is not it does not equal one

640
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
ton of carbon but that is the very basis

641
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,440
of carbon trading which was then created

642
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,740
as a mechanism under the protocol and I

643
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,960
think what resonates with a sort of big

644
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,580
tax mindset is

645
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,799
that we need to quantify and measure

646
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,120
everything

647
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,039
and that is something that very strongly

648
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,620
resonated with the climate conversation

649
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,900
back then and still today and the next

650
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,940
big step I think came sort of Turning

651
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,320
Point and we're still in the middle of

652
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,080
that that curve um came with the Paris

653
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,159
climate agreement after 2015. where we

654
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,260
now are talking not just about emission

655
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,539
reductions we're talking about Net Zero

656
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,760
we're talking about negative emissions

657
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,380
we're talking about the idea that we can

658
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,940
actually pull carbon out of the

659
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,539
atmosphere by some magical Technologies

660
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,039
um that you're going to do carbon

661
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,960
removal for us

662
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,720
um that is something that by the way big

663
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,340
tech companies like Microsoft are

664
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,440
heavily investing in and they're

665
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,679
counting on offsetting their big

666
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,580
footprint of emissions by investing in

667
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,380
um in in so-called removal Technologies

668
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,760
which are highly problematic

669
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,860
Technologies and by the way the European

670
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,600
commission has just proposed a new

671
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,360
framework to certify so-called carbon

672
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,299
removals from the land sector but also

673
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,220
from so-called carbon caption storage

674
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,100
and other big Technologies

675
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,620
to actually build a voluntary carbon

676
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,700
Market

677
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,919
around these removals at the EU level

678
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,679
just highly problematic

679
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,960
um so that's the next big turn that

680
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,159
we're taking and then there is another

681
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,260
one looming on the horizon that we're

682
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,659
very concerned about and that has to do

683
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,820
with a technology called solo

684
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,679
geoengineering it's actually a sweep of

685
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
Technologies it's not one but the idea

686
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,820
is that maybe you know the whole thing

687
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,440
about dealing with carbon is too

688
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,900
complicated there's a you know easier

689
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
cheap way that we can fix the climate

690
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,820
Problem by addressing some of the

691
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,220
symptoms of climate change by turning

692
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,020
down a temperature by taking control of

693
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,419
the global thermostat and basically

694
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,059
turning it down to whatever we want 1.5

695
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,700
degree you know who wants less let's see

696
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,400
so managing so-called radiative forcing

697
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,960
managing the level of sunlight that

698
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,760
reaches Earth and there are a number of

699
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,980
Technologies being researched and

700
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,899
increasingly they're moving into outdoor

701
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,779
experiments big Tech is very interested

702
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,980
this field is full of Silicon Valley

703
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,620
startup sort of idealists or optimists

704
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,419
who want to go for it and actually just

705
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,419
a few weeks ago a Silicon Valley startup

706
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,580
firm can't make sunsets announced that

707
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,480
they did the first Rogue so unauthorized

708
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,460
solo geo-engineering experiments in

709
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,720
Mexico

710
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
um just in April last year

711
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,679
um it just was announced that they did

712
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,419
it at the end of last year the Mexican

713
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,000
Government now announced to ban it but

714
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,080
um

715
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
um which is the right decision I think

716
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,700
but anyway so the idea that we should

717
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,919
get rid of it or in addition to the

718
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,260
carbon metric that is really dominating

719
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,600
climate policy actually introduce a new

720
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
metric of radiative forcing is something

721
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,520
that resonates strongly with the big

722
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,240
Tech sector you know make sunsets it was

723
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,740
already beginning to sell so-called

724
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,779
cooling credits instead of carbon

725
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,240
offsets you can have Cooling offsets

726
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,799
so that opens up like the door widely to

727
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,960
a whole sweep of not just false

728
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,080
Solutions but sort of

729
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,179
risky technologies that have the

730
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,179
potential to destroy entire you know

731
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,760
clamp climate systems including things

732
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,980
like the monsoon which millions of

733
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,260
people depend on for their livelihoods

734
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,760
and their lives

735
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,860
all of that is quite scary

736
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,559
um and I do hope that we can form and

737
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,360
create new alliances between the digital

738
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,220
Rights Movement under climate Justice

739
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,960
movement so I'm very glad we're

740
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,340
beginning to have this conversation

741
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,200
today today here and in many other

742
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,740
spaces

743
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,320
thank you so much Lily I think I I noted

744
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,240
some reactions from the audience this

745
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,559
idea that the main metric around climate

746
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,360
change would now be how much sunlight

747
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,460
hits the Earth

748
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,140
um it's kind of where do you go from

749
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,360
there if that becomes the main solution

750
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,520
that we're banking on and is it even

751
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,059
possible to or feasible for the kind of

752
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,659
global cooperation required to make uh

753
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,700
geoengineering have this desired effect

754
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,140
and if that does get put into place

755
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,720
is there kind of a lock-in then for you

756
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,940
know the mid to long-term future and a

757
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,820
Reliance on on just having less sunlight

758
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,220
going forward so that that feels quite

759
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,700
fundamental thank you so much

760
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,580
um now we want to ask uh pause uh to

761
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,140
reflect on techno capitalism and

762
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,360
um kind of challenging this idea of the

763
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,720
twin transition that um I introduced as

764
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,380
being an important part of uh approaches

765
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,080
to Innovation at the moment in the EU

766
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,678
and Beyond pause

767
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,620
thank you Becky uh yes I want to

768
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,360
introduce the idea of technocational

769
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,059
capitalism instead of talking only about

770
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,539
big tax in the understanding uh that

771
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:27,360
although big Tech is a great example of

772
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,700
protagonal capitalism I believe that it

773
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,360
is the techno-capitalist ideology also

774
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
adopted as a demonic logic by most

775
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,520
digital developments including the

776
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,700
developments made by the states that

777
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,799
must be fought as a solution to the

778
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,600
climate and the ecological crisis

779
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,480
basically because as Mel Hogan says

780
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,240
techno capitalism implies Big Data

781
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,760
ecologies no so for example the creation

782
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,419
of an infrastructure generally placed in

783
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,059
foreign territories specially

784
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,059
conditioned to infinite growth with

785
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,679
intensive exploitation of Natural

786
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,520
Resources to operate if everything is

787
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,120
subject of datification digital

788
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,399
infrastructures become more intensive in

789
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,679
their consumption of of course natural

790
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,380
resources and that intensive

791
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,240
infrastructure

792
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
um

793
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,159
in all its life cycle affects human and

794
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,799
non-human communities which tend to be

795
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,899
of course the bodies that matter the

796
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,000
least to capitalism

797
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,820
so this is why the false solution of the

798
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,220
so-called twin transition is dangerous

799
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,919
primarily as understood by the European

800
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,440
commission where the competitiveness of

801
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,500
Europe is in the global economy is by

802
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,740
far the first priority and where the

803
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,899
complementary transitions are more near

804
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,480
of a geopolitical idea than an actual

805
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,960
scientific truth one because due to the

806
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,440
indirect effects of techno-capitalist

807
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,539
digitization we will likely have a

808
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,460
digital rebound effect in many

809
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,339
Industries so it is at least this is

810
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,460
strange to seriously believe that they

811
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,619
are complementary transitions when

812
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,099
conclusive evidence is still lacking you

813
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,800
know but more importantly to say that

814
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,239
they are twin transitions is to accept

815
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,460
that both green energies and digital

816
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,580
Technologies are the industries where

817
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,980
the control of the world economy is

818
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,679
being played out between China the

819
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,159
United States and the European Union

820
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,679
thus the twin transition concept is an

821
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,199
economical concept more than a Green

822
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,379
Solution Green Solution you know to to

823
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,699
the crisis

824
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,339
but I want to return to the issue of

825
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,560
technocational capitalism as the logic

826
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,960
to be suspected as an approach to The

827
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
Climate crisis not only looking at how

828
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,380
big Tech is portraying itself as a

829
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,619
friend of the environment but also

830
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,380
um at initiatives that have much better

831
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,079
press in terms of green text but that

832
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,220
continues with techno-capitalist logics

833
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,980
and here you know taking advance to the

834
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,320
fact that I am in a European Forum I

835
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,660
want to bring fairphone into the

836
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,980
discussion

837
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,320
um in their last book

838
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
um

839
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,200
do a fascinating analysis of the images

840
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,440
of the first one website where magically

841
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,320
the white bodies are the ones that

842
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,339
repair

843
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,859
and the color red bodies are the ones

844
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,560
working in minds but of course not any

845
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,380
Minds socially responsible Minds

846
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,540
according to the company

847
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,780
by the way first one

848
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,359
is holding a series of conversations

849
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,359
conversations here in Chile to see

850
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,180
sustainable lithium extraction methods

851
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,119
this green tech company instead of first

852
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,119
you know coordinated a conversation for

853
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,740
example with the indigenous communities

854
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,099
affected by this abstraction choose to

855
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,160
Ally with large German companies of

856
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,280
electric vehicles that is you know the

857
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,800
big Capital to the today is part of a

858
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,640
severe social environmental crisis here

859
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,760
at the salar of Atacama in the north of

860
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,720
Chile

861
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,140
so if you think it it's like teaming up

862
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,680
with Google to see a sustainable way to

863
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,140
exploit personal data

864
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,500
so Eddie Clements

865
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,800
State and I strongly agree that we

866
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,619
cannot produce a social justice problem

867
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,099
to a feel-good consumption practice of

868
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,320
European customers

869
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,099
I think might give us a clue where we

870
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,099
need to go in alternatives to techno

871
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,099
capitalism as a response to the climate

872
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,040
and the ecological crisis I don't want

873
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,839
to extend any further but I leave the

874
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,060
conversation open for for that

875
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,099
Collective reflection thank you very

876
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,240
much

877
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,880
thank you so much pause for calling our

878
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,099
attention to the contradictions of what

879
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,920
we might consider to be even agreeing or

880
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,859
responsible technology I think it shows

881
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,560
that there's always a way to go and that

882
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,599
part of that is acknowledging the

883
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,960
continued extractivism uh that comes

884
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,140
into play even with the devices that we

885
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,300
might feel better about

886
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,200
um and uh not to end it on a depressing

887
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,500
note we are going to also explore just

888
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,040
Pathways now but before I hand it over

889
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,579
to uh to Shauna I just want to invite

890
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,339
the online audience if you want to

891
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,320
engage with us on this question of what

892
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,079
is a false Solution please feel free to

893
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,119
tweet the hashtag no false Solutions

894
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,480
and now I want to hand it over to Shauna

895
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,880
thanks so much and uh yeah thanks so

896
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,619
much for those interventions Lily and

897
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,540
pause I think it's really useful to to

898
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,740
Really frame

899
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,960
um our understanding as well in terms of

900
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,300
just Pathways when we can identify what

901
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
are false Solutions I think we have a

902
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,560
much clearer idea of where where there

903
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,599
are real opportunities and really

904
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,520
learning from from communities and

905
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,380
people who have been doing this work for

906
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,420
centuries for Millennia

907
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,000
um I I live in the Prairies of so-called

908
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,300
Canada and um here in Canada and in the

909
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,280
U.S indigenous peoples and traditional

910
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,619
communities have been on the front lines

911
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,320
of Defending ecosystems defending the

912
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,300
rights of nature

913
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,920
um you know Recent research suggests

914
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,140
that 80 of the world's remaining

915
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,540
biodiversity is located on lands and

916
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,839
inhabited by indigenous peoples although

917
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,300
that only makes up 20 of the world's

918
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,339
territories it's it's very indicative of

919
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,980
the fact that indigenous peoples and

920
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,480
traditional communities have been doing

921
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,720
this work for so long and actually over

922
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,480
the past decade there's research to show

923
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,400
that indigenous communities specifically

924
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,220
in U.S and Canada who are resisting

925
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,560
fossil fuel projects have stopped or

926
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,720
delayed greenhouse gas pollution

927
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,140
equivalent to at least 25 percent of the

928
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,900
annual U.S and Canadian emissions which

929
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,119
is huge and there is a growing

930
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,339
recognition and I think we do need to

931
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,000
really be pushing our representatives in

932
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,040
different government spaces to be moving

933
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,440
this forward here in Canada the

934
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,359
government has just started to develop a

935
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,940
Guardians project there's more work to

936
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,220
support indigenous nations in setting up

937
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,460
for protected and conservation areas but

938
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,380
unfortunately that relationship doesn't

939
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,599
often come as a kind of nation to Nation

940
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,079
partnership it's often still a very um

941
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,780
you know Legacy of colonialism in terms

942
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,940
of the ways in which the the Canadian

943
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,740
government is approaching the

944
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,900
relationship with indigenous Nations so

945
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,579
I think it's important to think about

946
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,640
how we any as digital rights actors can

947
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,440
really be supporting and acting in

948
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,660
solidarity with these movements with

949
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,359
land and territory Defenders who really

950
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,060
understand the ecosystems far better

951
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,520
than any anyone who's just swooping in

952
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,920
and hoping to you know set up a carbon

953
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
offset scheme

954
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,180
um and so just with that very brief

955
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,180
framing I want to really now turn the

956
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,339
mic to to Plumbing to reflect on some of

957
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:37,619
the ways in which environmental and

958
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,720
internet governance have started to

959
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,359
really find these intersections and some

960
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,000
of the opportunities for collaboration

961
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,680
problem number two

962
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,920
thank you thank you Sean

963
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,020
first of all I want to just come back to

964
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,460
this uh

965
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,400
reference point that I was making when I

966
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,900
presented myself and my background that

967
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,760
the environmental rights and the

968
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,680
environmental justice and now Primal

969
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,200
Justice if we could take more broadly

970
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,800
it's she has been around for many years

971
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,140
more than 50 years and have been

972
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,900
developing as a

973
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,680
has a true Democratic tool of

974
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,579
influencing the the development of the

975
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:26,280
society development of industrial

976
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,540
Solutions

977
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,859
and this history and the lessons and the

978
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:35,520
collected knowledge but also experience

979
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,760
in the in the field of Environmental

980
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,560
Protection by the environmental

981
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,079
activists it's really very important

982
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,619
because there is obviously New Era new

983
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,339
stage of this

984
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,640
struggle between between the the

985
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,300
economic industry interests and also the

986
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,520
the interests of people to live in

987
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,760
health environment we live in in their

988
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,520
places where they could have a clear in

989
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,040
air water soil have reached biodiversity

990
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,260
so in a way uh environmental rights have

991
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,380
been really enabling people to defend

992
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,300
their uh the land their livelihood and

993
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,960
in a way it was a powerful tool in the

994
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,560
hands of the of the week week part of

995
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,380
the society because otherwise industry

996
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,140
itself you know wouldn't be a

997
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,660
will then be self-regulate I think

998
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,640
itself in a way that it will really

999
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,160
produce a positive change taking into

1000
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,740
account of the public interest so coming

1001
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,540
back to the public interest I think it's

1002
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,640
a good reference across a reference

1003
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,359
point about uh to understand how how the

1004
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,099
digital and the environmental rights

1005
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:55,800
could in the sector and I won't just

1006
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,420
present you the example of an office

1007
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,839
conversion which has been has become

1008
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,020
recently also Global uh uh legal

1009
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,480
instrument otherwise was covering the

1010
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,960
countries of Europe and the Central

1011
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,540
Asia but now it's not every country

1012
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,540
could be part of to the convention so

1013
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,079
this uh or whose convention has enabled

1014
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,780
to its uh three pillars access to

1015
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,599
information uh public participation and

1016
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,400
access to Justice and environmental

1017
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,119
matters I enabled

1018
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,099
all the

1019
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,380
Angels activists and uh not just the

1020
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,540
general public in the country's

1021
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,020
participle convention uh to have a

1022
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,880
stronger and uh

1023
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,300
and more powerful way to uh

1024
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,680
to control to monitor or to resist in a

1025
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,780
way to the over exploitation of

1026
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,040
financial resources to to

1027
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,260
be part of of the discussion and also

1028
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,900
decision making process where the

1029
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,480
governmental governmental authorities

1030
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,260
decide whether one one or another

1031
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,460
another project will be

1032
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,980
approved or not so this convention has

1033
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,240
become really a very strong

1034
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,940
safeguard for for nature and also a

1035
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,240
benchmark for for environmental

1036
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,660
democracy because it also links the

1037
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,300
environmental and human rights and also

1038
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,180
acknowledges that the the fact that we

1039
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,980
owe an obligation to the Future

1040
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,060
generations and also establishes

1041
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:41,220
establishes the sustainable development

1042
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,660
should be achieved only through the

1043
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,359
involvement of the all stakeholders it

1044
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,119
has influenced really the policy making

1045
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,280
and also the thinking in a way of the

1046
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,079
decision-making process also a business

1047
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,500
level in many counties because for

1048
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,420
example Bulgaria is a practical

1049
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,640
convention European Union as a union is

1050
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,859
a part of the convention although not

1051
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,460
perfect member I should say but so in a

1052
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,660
way

1053
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,740
this international law uh over imposing

1054
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,400
this new uh new rules for uh procedural

1055
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,560
rights she has been changing the

1056
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,339
landscape of the Democracy uh a national

1057
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,859
level so this is a really powerful

1058
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:26,040
instrument which could be in the lessons

1059
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,960
for more than 20 years of uh

1060
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,280
history of implementing of this

1061
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,160
convention he has been could be really

1062
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,859
important reference point for any

1063
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,280
conversation related to how we could uh

1064
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,180
how could approach and understand and in

1065
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,740
a way be involved into the

1066
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,020
decision-making processes related also

1067
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,220
to the

1068
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,319
to the Improvement on the introduction

1069
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,359
of new technologies which might be

1070
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,960
digital or other Technologies which I

1071
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,599
have hasn't been haven't been regulated

1072
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,859
yet but anyway the environmental law is

1073
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,599
uh protecting and ensuring

1074
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,040
decision-making processes to be uh to be

1075
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,359
a democratic and an inclusive so that we

1076
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,599
could really regulate and and be

1077
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:21,060
involved into the decision making for

1078
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,640
the development of different

1079
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,920
infrastructure projects it was in the

1080
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,859
life of everyone so the same way uh I

1081
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:31,140
think all the new infrastructure digital

1082
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,839
and other infrastructure of new new

1083
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,200
generation would be also I would need

1084
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,819
also this really uh all-inclusive

1085
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:44,520
element of decision making process and

1086
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,460
openness really full access to

1087
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,220
information probably participation and

1088
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,220
eventually as much as possible under the

1089
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,079
different

1090
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,180
Nation Nation Frameworks even the

1091
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,880
Frameworks access to Justice and also

1092
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,339
the challenging different decisions and

1093
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,319
also challenging in the best case also

1094
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,819
the business in the car thank you very

1095
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:08,000
much

1096
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,200
thanks so much Clement I I really

1097
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,359
appreciate also your your reflection on

1098
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,160
the ways in which the arhus convention

1099
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,380
has really sort of shifted thinking

1100
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,339
around

1101
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,720
um these issues and I think that's

1102
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,520
really valuable to think about how we

1103
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,400
resist false narratives and again as you

1104
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,140
said the opportunities to really use

1105
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,359
this mechanism to really address that

1106
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,180
Gap as we see there's clearly a concern

1107
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,160
among you know the majority of people

1108
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,900
living on this planet about the climate

1109
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,579
crises and it's really the people who

1110
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,859
are in power who are refusing to act so

1111
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,839
thanks so much Clement I think that's a

1112
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,240
really valuable example

1113
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,720
so I want to now uh turn back to the

1114
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,680
um on ground in Brussels uh to hear from

1115
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,420
narmeen to reflect a little bit on

1116
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,119
what's happening at the EU level now I

1117
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,460
mean the floor is yours thank you very

1118
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,160
much and I would I would like to set a

1119
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,460
bit of light on how actually companies

1120
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,140
publish on their website their

1121
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,480
environmental impact you would see on

1122
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,980
Google for instance they will tell you

1123
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,900
how the data center in climate neutral

1124
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,119
and this is actually an environmental

1125
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:13,619
claims

1126
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,520
um and 57 of EU consumers are receptive

1127
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,579
to these environmental claims when they

1128
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:25,260
buy or use any services or buy a product

1129
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,500
and in certain countries there are even

1130
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,260
more receptive for instance Sweden or

1131
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,339
Denmark

1132
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,920
what does it mean it means that we have

1133
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,640
companies using a marketing strategy to

1134
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,940
showcasing how well they are well the

1135
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,700
environmental footprint is regardless on

1136
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,160
of how reliable that information could

1137
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,200
be

1138
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,900
and because it's self-awarded by the the

1139
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,940
manufacturers or the person providing

1140
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,380
the service or the projects we have a

1141
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,079
lack of trusting for from consumers

1142
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,020
because you can have a label or a claim

1143
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,680
that is actually real and has been

1144
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,140
Justified and others which are

1145
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,079
unreliable super vague

1146
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,380
um and or even wrong sometimes and

1147
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,300
because consumers like that type of

1148
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,359
information they are being confused and

1149
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,400
Spanish consumer organization have even

1150
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,040
shown that

1151
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,040
uh more than 43 percent of people do not

1152
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,900
stress anymore the environmental claims

1153
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,380
on products so we have a situation where

1154
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,720
people do care about how they consume

1155
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,020
how they they about what they buy and

1156
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,180
the the response that companies are

1157
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,339
providing to us consumers

1158
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:47,040
and this screen washing is also

1159
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,520
misleading other economical actors so

1160
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,099
it's not even giving the advantage due

1161
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,619
to the to the people making the effort

1162
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,900
to Green the product and their

1163
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,260
activities and ultimately that leads

1164
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,960
obviously to a less green economy

1165
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,180
I'm talking about this because I think

1166
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,280
it's a really good example on how we can

1167
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,319
create a better environment for our

1168
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,440
infrastructures and our products the

1169
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,859
European Union I mean the European

1170
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,020
legislation is

1171
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,780
um exists on this matter but it's mainly

1172
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,819
on the information that a company is

1173
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,339
supposed to give to the consumer and

1174
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,200
there are two legislative texts that

1175
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,160
provide

1176
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,560
um I mean that gives a legal basis to

1177
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,079
this one of them is the consumer rights

1178
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,060
directive and the other one is the

1179
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,880
inferior commercial practice directive

1180
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,099
and both of them oblige the

1181
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:42,839
manufacturers actually give the

1182
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,359
information but also for bits any

1183
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,619
misleading omission of information now

1184
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,900
we still have a problem because a

1185
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,540
product can still enter the market and

1186
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,819
we without being justified and that

1187
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,800
would mean that you would have to bring

1188
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,780
a complaint to the table and I would

1189
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,520
take ages and the project will still be

1190
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,460
on the market while it's misleading us

1191
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,500
so we we end finally we know that there

1192
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,260
is no obligation

1193
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,880
to to provide any information on the

1194
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,059
environmental aspect of it so you can't

1195
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,640
really ban a green claim and that is

1196
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,500
really the problem and this is why

1197
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,260
you're doing I mean we believe as greens

1198
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,020
that it's really important to regulate

1199
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,260
those claims and ensure that

1200
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,240
um you don't have companies claiming but

1201
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,579
they are not claiming things that they

1202
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:37,980
were actually not doing

1203
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,400
um recently in December 2019 at the very

1204
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,500
beginning of the Mandate the European

1205
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,040
commission but for the European winter

1206
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,160
and this is a strategy that

1207
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,160
that aims at Greening pretty much a lot

1208
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,119
of topics like Mobility food housing and

1209
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,480
even the finance

1210
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,900
financing Factory but they decided early

1211
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,559
in 2020 to finally tackle the problem on

1212
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,339
greenwashing they first published in no

1213
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,700
in 2022 sorry that published a proposal

1214
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,880
on on empowering the consumers in the

1215
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,400
green transition and the aim was really

1216
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,559
to create an environment where you could

1217
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,800
publish trustworthy information on how

1218
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,880
eco-friendly a product is and give a

1219
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,900
consumer a better role or a bigger role

1220
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,420
so little disclaimer I shouldn't I mean

1221
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,640
I don't believe that the burden should

1222
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,400
be put on the consumer this is not how

1223
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,000
the ecological transition should be done

1224
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,619
but creates and trustworthy

1225
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,180
informational oblige the manufacturers

1226
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,300
to stop reducing products infrastructure

1227
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,220
that goes against ecological transition

1228
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,540
and this is

1229
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,839
an economic way and that is this I mean

1230
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,520
you can discuss whether we should use

1231
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,140
this this way

1232
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,780
um but that that brings actually a way

1233
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,300
to find company for providing

1234
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,859
information that is wrong

1235
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:08,700
um

1236
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,920
now what is interesting into that text

1237
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,119
is that it will pre pre-approve any

1238
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:16,619
claims

1239
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,300
um that the company will put into the

1240
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,339
market and that would have to be done by

1241
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,200
a national body

1242
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,760
um and

1243
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,819
I think it would enable to avoid like

1244
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,980
purita to come to the market and

1245
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,140
actually have no impact on our side I

1246
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,559
mean positive impacts on our society the

1247
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,540
second thing is that it will provide

1248
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,880
more information on the durability the

1249
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,720
repairability of of a product

1250
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,020
um and it would also ban and that I

1251
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,700
found super interesting the

1252
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,980
environmental claims so every claim like

1253
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
you know sustainability eco-friendly

1254
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,059
climate neutral all those words would

1255
00:53:54,059 --> 00:53:56,160
have to be proven by

1256
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,740
um by um by that would have to be

1257
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,319
actually backed up by a scientists and

1258
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:06,540
performance and indicator developed by

1259
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,940
the commission so then the question is

1260
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,000
will that indicator could be good enough

1261
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,940
and that I I actually don't know but

1262
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,740
it's better that at least we have an

1263
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,960
institutionalized way of looking into

1264
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,079
what companies will be able to claim or

1265
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,740
put on their website or put on their

1266
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,180
products or what type of Labor they

1267
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,800
would be using

1268
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,000
um in a natural I think this um the this

1269
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,400
new proposal would really help us

1270
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,040
European consumers

1271
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,920
um have a better impact on the on the

1272
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,359
planet but also that would blight

1273
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,040
manufacturers to really respect what

1274
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,500
they are actually saying and this could

1275
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,119
be really inspiring not from not only

1276
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,160
from a consumer perspective but for more

1277
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,920
General services that we have and apply

1278
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,020
to digital platform a digital platform

1279
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,300
Digital Services that you would have to

1280
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,040
use because this is really linked to

1281
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,280
products that you're buying not Services

1282
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,099
um so we could extend potentially this

1283
00:55:05,099 --> 00:55:07,800
legislation to other ways

1284
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,579
um

1285
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:11,819
and finally have more better information

1286
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:15,119
for consumers for manufacturers and for

1287
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,339
any economic players that is going to

1288
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,280
enter the market and not undermine the

1289
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,599
green transition thank you

1290
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,059
thank you so much narmine that's really

1291
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,319
valuable to hear about these

1292
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,540
developments and as you were speaking I

1293
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,619
was thinking about some of the

1294
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,599
reflections that really you shared about

1295
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,579
changing metrics and thinking about some

1296
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,380
of the metrics that that you mentioned

1297
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,240
are being for example durability and

1298
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,220
repairability and you know one of the

1299
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,960
questions I thought was is this

1300
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
something because of some of the you

1301
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,260
know right to repair campaigns that have

1302
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,059
happened in Europe that that these

1303
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:50,520
metrics have gotten more prominent and

1304
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,960
just thinking again about those

1305
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,819
performance indicators and your note and

1306
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:55,740
I mean about their effectiveness it

1307
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,240
seems like there's really a lot more

1308
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,859
conversation needed to be have around

1309
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,380
around indicators and metrics and how we

1310
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,619
really understand this movement towards

1311
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:06,780
um you know it just transition thinking

1312
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,400
about the ways in which the pathways

1313
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,020
have really narrowed over the last

1314
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,020
decade So yeah thank you so much narmeen

1315
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,079
and before I pass back to

1316
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,300
um to start asking some questions I do

1317
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,099
want to just also invite anyone who's on

1318
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,140
Twitter if you want to share some

1319
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,359
examples that you know of of

1320
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,040
um you know actions that are really

1321
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,260
contributing to just Pathways for

1322
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,599
climate Justice and sustainability it'd

1323
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,400
be great to hear from you

1324
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,500
back to you back to you

1325
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,200
thanks so much Shawna and Elsa nermeen

1326
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,599
for your intervention

1327
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,059
um this actually brings us to

1328
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,059
um uh to opening the floor to questions

1329
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:48,359
both from the audience here and online

1330
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:50,460
so

1331
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,339
um yes does anyone have a question

1332
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:55,619
they'd like to pose to the panelists and

1333
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,260
maybe we can pass the microphone over uh

1334
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:04,760
then I see um one hand up uh over here

1335
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:16,800
hi I'm Jonas from the Ohio University of

1336
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,640
Brussels a communication researcher

1337
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,839
working on data protection impact

1338
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,760
assessments so actually it reminded me

1339
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,859
quite a bit I've been learning a lot

1340
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,480
from environmental impact assessments

1341
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,900
when we were conceptualizing

1342
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,099
um especially the involvement of

1343
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,980
citizens in these impact assessments so

1344
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,359
I'm very interested in the links between

1345
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,339
the digital rights and the and and more

1346
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:41,099
environmental rights but my question

1347
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:42,960
um

1348
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,240
where I really thought what you were

1349
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,680
talking about links to the digital

1350
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,559
Rights Movement was um enforcement so um

1351
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,059
some of the ideas that you've been just

1352
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,640
presenting um about like green washing

1353
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,940
or forthcoming green washing how um well

1354
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,680
seeing for example the gdpr how

1355
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,720
difficult it can be to enforce um these

1356
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,240
rules how isn't it extremely wouldn't it

1357
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,220
it sounds extremely complicated to

1358
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,300
enforce

1359
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,760
um for example what companies write on

1360
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,920
their products to

1361
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,319
um

1362
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,940
to inform the consumer so how realistic

1363
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,180
is that in practice uh that these rules

1364
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,400
are actually being enforced followed and

1365
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,940
enforced

1366
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:25,559
um nurmeen would you like to answer this

1367
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,079
and yes sorry I think just like for the

1368
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,480
pr it would be National Authority then

1369
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,579
you would have to the question of would

1370
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,020
you really like to have consumer

1371
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,900
authority to organize this or do we

1372
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,119
prefer to have competitive Authority I

1373
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,500
mean I think that was the same question

1374
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,280
the Hub that took place for the DPR

1375
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,040
um frankly it's um I found really

1376
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,460
difficult to to know if a consumer

1377
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,839
organization will be better than a

1378
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,619
competitive competition organization but

1379
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,260
since it's a consumer directive I mean

1380
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,359
both of them are it would make more

1381
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:02,460
sense than they are the one following

1382
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,059
this topic I mean precisely on on the on

1383
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:07,020
the

1384
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,700
um and very practice directive that

1385
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,619
that's the case

1386
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,900
um then then remains another question

1387
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,520
what is the financial mean that would

1388
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,559
you would like as a member states to

1389
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,319
provide to these authorities this is a

1390
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:22,500
political will question it's each

1391
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,260
National member states

1392
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,000
taking I mean taking it seriously and

1393
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,760
putting um the the money into the

1394
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,859
national authorities

1395
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,520
um

1396
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,920
so I would really frankly answer that

1397
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,480
the consumer organization should be in

1398
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,420
charge of this and we will see if if

1399
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,579
that will take in place but then the

1400
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,400
methodology should be one that is made

1401
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,440
by the European commission so that you

1402
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,599
have a normalized methodology beforehand

1403
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,280
that could be used by every National

1404
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,200
authorities later

1405
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,359
I hope it really answers your question

1406
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,460
uh I see another hand up

1407
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,500
yeah thanks a lot my name is Maximilian

1408
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,380
I'm a part of figure of Belgium and

1409
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,180
thanks a lot for for all of your

1410
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,220
interventions my question would go to

1411
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,079
Lily and pass we heard you sketching uh

1412
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,180
problems but I would also like for you

1413
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,099
to have the opportunity to sketch just

1414
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,380
pathway and the way out of techno

1415
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,140
capitalism so how do we change and how

1416
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,359
do we challenge it and what paths should

1417
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,420
International climate policy take

1418
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,339
um you spoke about perhaps not being

1419
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:34,680
taken Lily maybe maybe you have a an

1420
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:39,259
idea of which one to follow thanks a lot

1421
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,140
do you want me to check this immediately

1422
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,540
um yeah okay

1423
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:51,359
um so I do not have a grant master plan

1424
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,460
to offer um to make a clue because I'm

1425
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,319
skeptical about what we need is a big

1426
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,240
master plan um but that's maybe not what

1427
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,400
you're asking and

1428
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,220
I think like there's so many things we

1429
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,720
could and should be doing

1430
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,000
um but if I just name a few it's really

1431
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
phasing out fossil fuels as fast and as

1432
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,299
completely as possible starting

1433
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:13,740
yesterday

1434
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,500
um and that is not what we're doing at

1435
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,420
this point and we're doing so many

1436
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,220
things that are counterproductive to

1437
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,140
that urgent and necessary phasing out of

1438
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,480
fossil fuels including

1439
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,640
um you know brainwashing in the form of

1440
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,440
you know calling

1441
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,599
new investments in fossil gas

1442
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:33,000
infrastructure clean

1443
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,940
um so phasing out fossil fuels um and

1444
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,640
then also stopping the destruction of of

1445
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,859
ecosystems that are still standing and

1446
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:43,500
and allowing those already destroyed

1447
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,140
um to to be restored

1448
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,700
um it's a key one Transforming Our

1449
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,680
industrial agriculture system into

1450
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,940
something that's more just and

1451
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,099
sustainable and based on around

1452
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:55,559
agri-ecology for example and diverse

1453
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,660
models so there are many many different

1454
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,640
things I I was just listening to the

1455
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,680
conversation reflecting myself on what

1456
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,839
are the parts where I see you know the

1457
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,180
solution pass or ways forward where the

1458
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,740
digital rights movement and the climate

1459
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,660
Justice movement intersect and could

1460
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,819
really be working together just want to

1461
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:13,380
name two

1462
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,819
um that really come to the Forefront for

1463
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:16,680
me one is really

1464
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,540
that the climate Justice movement knows

1465
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,760
how to tackle the fossil fuel industry

1466
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,740
and Lobby right that's what the climate

1467
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,319
Justice movement is good at

1468
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:27,119
that part of the movement does not

1469
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,240
really get the mindsets of big Tech and

1470
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,040
Silicon Valley and how these companies

1471
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,119
operate

1472
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,980
and how we can tackle them and I think

1473
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,780
that is what many of you I can't see you

1474
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,460
in the audience but I believe you know

1475
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,079
much better or that part of the movement

1476
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,119
is much better so I'm inviting all of

1477
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:43,940
you to join the fight against

1478
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:47,579
geoengineering and a big techno fixes

1479
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:49,380
because we need that knowledge and we

1480
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,720
need those synergies the other thing um

1481
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,400
connecting it back to the issue of

1482
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,220
surveillance and shrinking spaces that

1483
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,200
apparently was discussed in a workshop

1484
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,240
we're extremely concerned about the next

1485
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,480
climate conference happening um in a UAE

1486
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,540
a country where digital surveillance is

1487
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,280
very very strong

1488
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,440
human rights

1489
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,920
um are not protected at all and we

1490
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,480
already saw what happened at the last

1491
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,780
Conference of parties um in Egypt

1492
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,579
the good news was the climate and the

1493
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,319
human rights movement were beginning to

1494
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,880
work together and actually have Joint

1495
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,440
Communications at that last Conference

1496
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,780
of parties not sure how that's going to

1497
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,240
play out at the cop in UAE but I do

1498
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,920
think that the climate Justice movement

1499
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,200
at the cup needs much more support from

1500
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,660
digital rights activists both in terms

1501
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:41,099
of concrete analysis of you know apps

1502
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:42,359
that are being offered to participants

1503
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,680
of the conference whether they're safe

1504
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,660
or not ways of communicating safely

1505
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,460
while on the ground Etc but also

1506
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,200
actually understanding the political

1507
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,240
context of the country that this

1508
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,520
movement is going to come to for that

1509
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,740
big un conference so those are two

1510
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,500
concrete things that I'm hoping

1511
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,839
um spark some interest in your movement

1512
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,839
um well I have

1513
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:10,020
three ideas you know the first one

1514
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,079
um you know especially thinking about

1515
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:15,660
what we have said before here in the

1516
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,540
with with panelists is

1517
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,799
um to understand that this is a

1518
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,619
planetary issue no so whatever is

1519
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:24,900
happening in Europe for example any

1520
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,579
measure that you take in Europe is going

1521
01:04:26,579 --> 01:04:29,220
to affect the rest of the world and in

1522
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:33,420
this regard I really you know my my core

1523
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:36,839
lists actually to think about what are

1524
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,339
the measures that Europe is taking

1525
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:40,799
around this especially around this

1526
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,200
screen washing thing Etc and how that is

1527
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,240
going to impact the rest of the world

1528
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,220
because this is capitalism and

1529
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,559
capitalism is gonna look for other place

1530
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,680
to extract

1531
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,440
resources data Etc I know and I think

1532
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,619
that is something that we need today uh

1533
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:00,900
ultimately address to understand that

1534
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,579
this is a planetary issue and I think

1535
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:06,720
that the European Union has a very

1536
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,960
important role here to think not only

1537
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,000
about Europe but open and its Vision to

1538
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,859
the rest of the world that is one thing

1539
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,079
especially you know for Europe the

1540
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:21,000
second thing is probably something that

1541
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,599
you have discussed a lot as privacy

1542
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,640
Specialists no the idea that we need to

1543
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,220
limit technical capitalism especially

1544
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,680
when we talk about big tax you know big

1545
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,700
tax are not a solution for the climate

1546
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,400
crisis no because this idea of growth

1547
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,640
and growth and growth of extractivism of

1548
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,799
data that means

1549
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:46,500
um use of a lot of Natural Resources Etc

1550
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,440
I know we need to limit techno

1551
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,660
capitalism and I know that is a super

1552
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,540
complex problem but we need to move to

1553
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,819
that direction and the second thing is

1554
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:00,420
that we not only need to reduce the

1555
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,140
power of techno-capitalism but also to

1556
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:07,099
um push public policies to have

1557
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:09,359
technodiversity you know and

1558
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:13,020
technodiversity understood as the

1559
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,880
Chinese philosopher yukui understands

1560
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,559
technodiversity now this idea that there

1561
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,980
are different technologies that can be

1562
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,920
tied to communities to their territories

1563
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,240
and to their customer Visions you know

1564
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,260
we are facing today this

1565
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:36,780
totalizing idea of technocapitalism no

1566
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,960
where you know every little

1567
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,819
um technology is tied to that

1568
01:06:43,819 --> 01:06:47,700
growth Logic No and we need public

1569
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:52,200
policies that can fertilize uh you know

1570
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,319
the the the

1571
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,880
scenario for different Logics of

1572
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,160
technology to appear you know because

1573
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,220
this is and I I want to end up with this

1574
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,599
no technology will accompany us

1575
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:10,140
in this problem no if you want to have

1576
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,319
Solutions technology will you know

1577
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,200
have a very important role but not any

1578
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,280
technology not technoc capitalism so we

1579
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,599
need to to to to urge you know our uh

1580
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:28,020
public policies uh to to to to them

1581
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,539
police the

1582
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:32,819
decision makers no to take public

1583
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:35,880
policies that can be actually

1584
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,339
um directed to have a more

1585
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:40,799
technodiversity field in in our

1586
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,180
realities thank you

1587
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,819
thank you so much for for these last

1588
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:50,099
Reflections and for the uh wonderful

1589
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,559
questions from the audience we are kind

1590
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,020
of coming on to the end of this

1591
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,520
discussion today

1592
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,900
but

1593
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,940
um we don't want this to be the end of

1594
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,819
the discussion and so that being said I

1595
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,559
know there there might have still been a

1596
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,020
couple hands up please feel free to

1597

reach out to us afterwards and I'm going

1598
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,359
to pass it over to Shawna now for some

1599
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:14,760

1604
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,939

um and so Becky's as Becky said and I

1610
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,439
think as we keep trying to bring up

1611
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:39,060
throughout this conversation we really

1612
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,040
want this to be an opening for

1613
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,040
conversations for people who maybe this

1614
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,960
is really new as well as really

1615
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,779
continuing the work that we're doing

1616
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:50,759
um with each other and and with our

1617
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,799
wider networks to really address these

1618
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,920
issues and so we are working with a

1619
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,540
coalition that will be hosting some

1620
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,120
discussions at mozfest at the end of

1621
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,100
March which is I believe the 20th to the

1622
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,020
24th of March

1623
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,399
um we'll be having a few conversations

1624
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:08,040
there and we're really hoping that this

1625
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,500
will be part of building coalitions um

1626
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,120
really connecting climate Justice and

1627
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,640
digital rights there has been a lot of

1628
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,920
work happening that around really uh

1629
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,198
having digital rights funders um really

1630
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,359
engaging in work towards climate Justice

1631
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,939
and supporting really intersectional

1632
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:25,920
research and we really hope that if

1633
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,179
you're interested in getting involved

1634
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:29,219
that you'll reach out to to those of us

1635
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:31,560
who are in the in the panel and the

1636
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,600
organizers to really think about

1637
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,660
um how we can continue working together

1638
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,100
um so I do just want to make sure that

1639
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,779
if everyone has if you want to see any

1640
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,880
final words the speakers and and then

1641
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,399
pass back to thank you

1642
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:47,880

1645
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,520
hybrid experiment with us

1646
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,020
