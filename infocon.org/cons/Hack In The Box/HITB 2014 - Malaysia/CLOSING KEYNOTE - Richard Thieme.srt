1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,660
good morning or good evening this is
Richard fame

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,420
escaping into

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,039
hack in the box

4
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,480
box in column 4 and wishing I could be
with you and and enjoying

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,929
everyone there it's a privilege and a
pleasure to join you one more time

6
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,550
for the final hack in the box in his
credit or Asian

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:32,309
and my charged this morning for this
evening

8
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,769
is to look back but primarily

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,089
on behalf of looking forward we're
talking about the

10
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,780
future above hacking as it has come to
be understood

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,170
but I really want to take it far beyond
what has come to be understood

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,290
because that's what the future is all
about

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,299
i want to ask the right questions
implicitly

14
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,140
a friend at the NASA said to me that
people were asking all the right

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,210
questions

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,509
about what technology is enabling today
and in the future

17
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:07,790
he said these are the right questions
how you live

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,630
vibrantly how do you free your mind

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,280
how do you live in a world without waltz

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,520
let's be clear about what that means all
of our behavior

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,990
all of our actions of our transactions

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,420
are now identifiable as marks

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,620
in the up well we still call cyberspace
for want of a better word although some

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,290
don't like it

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,850
we know what it means and we don't have
a better word to

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,020
designate that consensual hallucination

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,060
in which you and I are currently
participating

28
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,729
and in that world they're literally are
no walls

29
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:50,770
a ubiquitous surveillance and ubiquitous
intrusion

30
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,690
are the norm the new normal and are to
be expected

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,869
so in that kind of world going forward

32
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,970
how do we live nevertheless vibrantly
and with the kind obsessed

33
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,299
that has characterized not only the
hacking enterprise but the

34
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,129
scientific enterprise and and now more
than ever creating the structures we

35
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:11,790
need

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,790
for the future is a non-trivial

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,890
challenge why is that well

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,689
I me let me quote one of my favorite
people and in winter for

39
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,069
who said years ago looking at what was
happening as a result of

40
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,800
arpa and then darpa and then

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,900
restive us transforming the digital
world

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,360
into our real-world he said when we
invent a new technology

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,930
it's required that society also inject
the kinds of people

44
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,920
we're going to use it and along the way
all of our older practices

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,070
all of our relationships and how we
frame them and understand them

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,130
all over ways of defining our identities

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,650
and everyone else's identities all fall
by the wayside

48
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,740
a new practices new relationships

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,790
and new identities take right in case
after case he sets

50
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,030
the move to computerize in digitized
means pre-existing cultural farms

51
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,470
are going liquid I'd love that
expression it's like

52
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,270
you have in your hand an ice cube that
melts through your fingers when you try

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,090
to grasp it

54
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,300
they lose their former shape as their
retailers

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,390
for computerized expression up well

56
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,150
what this means is that hackers in the
past in the best sense of the word

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,850
I'm not talking about the non-state
actors or the state actors

58
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,280
who are doing espionage are

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,709
disinformation or the other nefarious
skaggs

60
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,440
activities including the criminal
activities which we all know

61
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,830
I mean hacking as we understand it at
its best

62
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,570
up what they did and what you are
charged to do going forward

63
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,120
is to fundamentally constitute a new
order thanks

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,209
I you know it machiavelli said about
that nothing

65
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,880
is more difficult he said to take in
hand

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,100
more perilous to conduct or more a
certain its success

67
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,440
that taking the lead in the introduction
of a new order of things

68
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
and this is exactly what you are charged
to do

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,700
as hackers up try I was twenty years ago

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,109
when I spoke Ford the first deaf kinda
which I spoke that cunt for

71
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,900
in July of 1996 I title that talk
hacking

72
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,419
as practice for transplanted Terry life
the 21st century

73
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:31,110
and that's why I reconstituted as my
first after the title of this talk

74
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,120
those same words hacking as practice for
transplanted Terry life in the 21st

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,860
century

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,120
because when I look back I'm what I said
twenty years ago

77
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,360
has all been true so this helps so that
you know you're not crazy

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,220
I've long said the wisdom any insanity
are contextual

79
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,229
class a lot more about that using Nichi
as our

80
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:57,460
torchlight in this world have doubt NKS
as we go forward

81
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,680
a what hacking was really about I said
then was

82
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
power and identity both is a culture and
is

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,870
a species and as individuals and it was
paradoxical for hackers

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,199
who were profoundly alone but profoundly
alone together

85
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
in a virtual space so

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,520
it's worse now it's worse now because
that revolution

87
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,660
up those changes to which langdon winter

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,960
referred have happened we no longer
speak up

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,110
quote going on the Internet up only a
few years ago

90
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,410
I'll we would say I'm going to get on
the internet now

91
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:43,060
young people which is where we look for
the future to be instantiated first

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,510
no longer speak up being on the Internet
any more than we speak and being on the

93
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,490
power grid

94
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,620
I don't say I'm going on the power grid
now and then flip a switch to turn on a

95
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,050
light

96
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,500
we say I'm going to turn on the light
and we turn on the light

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,460
we identify the specific functions that
have devolved into our hands

98
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,570
as a result of the power grid existing

99
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,750
and disappearing into the background we
name them

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,830
by their functions and the same thing is
happening

101
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,110
on what we used to call telephoning we
no longer really

102
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,139
say I'm making a phone call we taxed we
tweet

103
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,199
we use all sorts love media

104
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,860
to communicate are meaning but we don't

105
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,360
we don't say I'm going to call now and
years ago my mom

106
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,099
my dear old mother used to say sheesh
I'm going to go

107
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,770
ok make a long distance call everybody
be quiet the idea of a quote long

108
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,410
distance call is unthinkable

109
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,380
the idea saying I'm going into grade is
unthinkable and now

110
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,010
only in the last couple years the idea
of going on the Internet is unthinkable

111
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,300
that kinda fun think ability is what is
going to characterize the future

112
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,980
arena or

113
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,820
landscape in which hacking is going to
take place but because

114
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,510
that technological revolution has happen
and the changes now see more

115
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,460
incremental then transformational it is
to the other domains

116
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,940
that have been opened up and enabled by

117
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,360
that revolution up that we must to which
we must look

118
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,760
we must look to them to see how is
humanity going to change

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,230
I mention identity no years ago Matt
glaze said

120
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,420
up the weakest link in the security
chain

121
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,680
is the definition of the problem and the
definition of the problem he said

122
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,150
is not what we think it is well just
substitute

123
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,670
identity for security the weakest link

124
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,560
in understanding are very identities is
the definition of identity itself

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,360
and the definition identity because it
the technological revolutions that have

126
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,260
taken place

127
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,460
is not what we think it is

128
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,870
in in other words we have already been
through a process

129
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,370
I love annihilation a former identities

130
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,190
which had persisted for so long close
Renaissance post reformation posts

131
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,170
printing press

132
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,540
excuse me I those identities

133
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,050
I enable us to think of ourselves I
think this

134
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,050
as individuals we still do right

135
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,150
you still do thank you for yourself much
of the time as individuals

136
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,020
but your behaviors are not those have
just individuals

137
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,050
because you no longer function alone

138
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,060
I really ever out the Internet as we
call it

139
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,960
I love this global connectivity is we're
thinking takes place

140
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,870
and Marvin Minsky said many years ago
what do we mean by thinking

141
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,320
he said thinking is the ability to

142
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,190
hold in our mines simultaneously

143
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,560
a multiplicity of representations a
reality

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,650
and not be overwhelmed by that fact to
hold them there

145
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,080
lightly while we entertain that data
streaming into our brains

146
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,000
in order to decide which is a good
enough template our model

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,700
to use for now

148
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,720
and and it is just for now so he said
where is this thinking

149
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,050
taking place what's taking place in that
domain if internet-connected E

150
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,540
and anyone who tries to sank alone

151
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,460
separate from that is like a desktop
computer

152
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,570
on a table disconnected from the net

153
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,650
%uh you are like a brain in about

154
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,620
well that notion is literally
unthinkable

155
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,400
because we have come to you act as if we
are what we have become which is

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,390
notes in a network and nodes in a
network exercise power

157
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,550
very differently I spoke to the hackers
twenty years ago

158
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,110
about the exercise that power what we
are learning that

159
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,510
well hierarchical structures have
certainly not going away

160
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,040
and nation-states as fictitious
creations

161
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,580
in which we think we live and moving
still have our being

162
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,990
although we don't really are things

163
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,600
things have a changed radically and we
think I've ourselves

164
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,020
as nodes in a network who exercise power
not as we did in the hierarchy

165
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,870
which was by dominating in controlling
you cannot control

166
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,530
or dominate the net I've the net is too
fast

167
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,660
and above all it is distributed so the
way we exercise power is by

168
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,680
participating

169
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,280
and contributing now harking back to the
meritocracy called packard him

170
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,840
that emerged in cyberspace back in the
seventies

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,300
it was people bootstrapping themselves
together

172
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,040
out %uh individuality into a corporate
identity

173
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,000
are an identity based on mutuality and
be noted in network

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,390
and that meritocracy was based on yes
doing all the work you could do first

175
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,870
but then going to your betters learning
from them

176
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,910
upbringing to them good questions

177
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,300
not stupid questions like tell me how to
hack the ATM

178
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,580
but doing all your homework first

179
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,660
learning everything you could and then
taking that solvable problems

180
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,420
to the smarter collective for resolution

181
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,690
and if you showed the proper respect
your betters you were accepted into the

182
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,840
meritocracy and allowed to function

183
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,670
in that now

184
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,850
or well that's gonna point to something
else ahead

185
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,520
that is going to be crucial going
forward which is choose your friends and

186
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,420
colleagues

187
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,090
wisely because in the world is shifting
identities to which are referred

188
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,980
we often don't know it's like the man
who looked into the mir

189
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,340
%uh in a movie undercover cop and said I
don't know if I'm a

190
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,450
cop pretending to be a criminal are
criminal pretending to be a cop

191
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,000
%ah there are those false identities we
assume

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,940
in order to accomplish a different task
than people think we are accomplishing

193
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,150
but it's even much deeper than that

194
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,700
because our identities are being
transformed

195
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,250
by virtue of the structures that
transnational power

196
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,500
which have already emerged I'll let me
give you an example of that

197
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,890
up I was doing a speech for the FBI here

198
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,930
didn't a here in Milwaukee and I
referred to the fact that the FBI

199
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,290
was initially a police bureau setup

200
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,650
to do police work as a national police
force

201
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,720
in effect in the United States but it
was not empowered

202
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,120
to work outside the United States the
CIA

203
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,870
a one of many intelligence agencies we
haven't

204
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,010
and in use out was set up not to work
within the United States but to work in

205
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,540
every

206
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,350
other country but the United States well
today

207
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,500
the FBI has offices all over the world
and the CIA

208
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,670
is very active inside the United States
one example being their cooperation

209
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,420
well-known

210
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,430
with the New York Police followed 9/11

211
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,690
to attempt to ensure that that kind of
event

212
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,190
in New York did not happen again the New
York place did not bring borrow the

213
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,640
techniques if the CIA

214
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,040
they partnered with the CIA using

215
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
their people a using their technologies

216
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,830
as well so when I said that

217
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,200
I said the sources of power and
influence

218
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,270
that actually determine are real
behaviors

219
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,030
are not the nation states that initially
established the FBI and the CIA in the

220
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,790
first place

221
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,640
they are transnational entities for
which we still do not have the easy

222
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,630
or good names that creativity is is an
active naming

223
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:40,190
it is identifying these new emergent
properties and structures

224
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,260
and giving them names that is one of the
tasks

225
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,910
I love hacker to and the word cyberspace

226
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,120
invented I believe by William Gibson

227
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,350
I'll was used to designate that

228
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,480
space in which we operate that active
naming was a creative act which enable

229
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,120
people to get

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,089
their hands in affect their minds around
the new experiences and part in the

231
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,810
charge deckers going forward

232
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,860
is to be alert to the emergent
properties

233
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,440
and structures and give them names
before anyone else does

234
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,160
because that creative active naming is a
powerful act

235
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,540
which brings the reality into the world
of social

236
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,600
interaction among people so when I was
pointing this out

237
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,050
the especially agent in charge of the
local office

238
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,010
said bingo he said let me let me tell
you what happens

239
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:37,779
when we I use to approach people on the
basis of their patriotic feelings

240
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,390
in relationship to the United States we
said we need your cooperation and

241
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,620
invariably they would save course regard
to cooperate with you

242
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,600
now he said more and more I'm hearing
people say

243
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,199
we would love to do that but and the but
was the proof is my assertion

244
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:58,699
that while they wanted to act according
to what used to be called patriotic

245
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:59,760
motivations

246
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,199
the real sources up power and influence

247
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,339
I'm their behavior are other
transnational entities

248
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,410
which means that their real self
interest having become the self-interest

249
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,600
of those entities

250
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,800
is no longer aligned with the
self-interest as a nation-state

251
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,279
even as the nation state as its
boundaries become more and more porous

252
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,649
I and boundaries are are what give us
our identities

253
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,710
about continue to dissolve and so

254
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,010
I he said the fact I've how difficult it
is today to use patriotism

255
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,470
in and of itself for example for someone
from excuse me

256
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,590
lech Microsoft a or Nike

257
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,830
or any other transnational company about

258
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,930
its is illustrated by wonderful book a
berry wrote in Australia

259
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,840
it which the surnames of people where
the companies corporations or entities

260
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,860
for which they work

261
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,040
Jennifer government was the name into
the book

262
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,730
a bob Nike us sylvester Facebook

263
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,150
up because those entities globally
distributed have much more to do

264
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,160
with what you in fact do then

265
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,910
the nation-state itself and i say more
about that because this is change the

266
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,540
face up

267
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,680
intelligence completely it has made

268
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,630
the belief that intelligence is a
function of the nation-state

269
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,750
on its own behalf only one definition

270
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,110
and another definition that's coming to
the fore is to work collaboratively and

271
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,290
cooperatively

272
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,160
in the trenches globally on behalf of
preventing chaos

273
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,270
from breaking out and that prevention
and KS may in fact sometimes

274
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,040
undermine your ability to function on
behalf of the nation-state

275
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,320
in

276
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,880
way that the FBI special agent said that
the real source is a power and influence

277
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,630
sometimes up prevent us from acting out
what we used to call patriotic

278
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,830
impulses so I'm trying to do justice

279
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,760
to the significance the changes that
have already taken place

280
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,079
a it hurts this is really serious

281
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,930
and going forward it's going to be a lot
worse it's going to be a lot worse

282
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,810
because as I said the technological
revolution

283
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,079
they created hacking as an entity in the
first place and Akard them

284
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,320
as enable those other domains to advance

285
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,250
at the same radical speed faster than
anyone in those domains

286
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,570
can keep up with up for example this is
the most important

287
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,330
up the biological sciences back

288
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,050
ten years ago when MIT chose a president

289
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,690
a woman whose background was in biology
and not engineering

290
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,230
there was one other signs are what have
the docs you could connect

291
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,390
to say where r thing said they're headed

292
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,130
to the primacy a biological engineering

293
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,480
a genetic engineering artificial light

294
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,430
splicing attributes and new
possibilities under the Species

295
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,470
up that will make hacking biology or bio
hacking

296
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,300
or DIY bio as they try to tame it in the
academic

297
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,490
universe up in the forefront

298
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,590
enable behind the technological
transformation

299
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,140
above our technologies a bit information
and communication up at the same will

300
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,760
happen in material science

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,650
%uh nanotechnology and the creation

302
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,430
I love new possibilities in the physical

303
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,470
world just as biology is the creation

304
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,000
up new code which enables new
possibilities in the organic

305
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,920
world all of which is are subsets

306
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,720
up the creation %uh new cognitive
artifacts

307
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,970
are possibilities for thinking which are
a result

308
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,030
a packing properly understood that is up
the

309
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,410
acknowledged technological revolution so

310
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,850
how do you free your mind how do you are

311
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,470
main up vigilant in such a world

312
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,130
how do you remain as the Buddhist say
mindful

313
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,140
when this is taking place in order to
identify

314
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,960
and work with your colleagues to
construct

315
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,380
that cognitive artifacts which in turn
are instantiated immediately in the

316
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,550
physical world

317
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,310
as real behaviors which have social

318
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,580
and political and economic consequences
I as well as religious

319
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,270
and artistic in other words all of the
domains of human culture

320
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,160
how can you do that going forward using
what we have learned from the past

321
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,210
in order to bill that future in order to
have

322
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,710
power which as I said is exercised by

323
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,560
contributing and participating as a node

324
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,450
in a network well one way you can do not
do this is to recognize

325
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,730
that is a she said you are exercising
saw

326
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,370
leadership I said that to the hackers it
def cut twenty years ago

327
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,220
and some in the audience remember last
but others

328
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,960
up her told me recently know we knew
what you meant

329
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,960
well these are the ones who have gone on
to corporate Heights

330
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,220
to work at NSA to work at darpa to work
at CIA

331
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,510
et cetera in other words young men

332
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,740
a few young women at that time

333
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,730
recognized in the nascent possibilities
they were manipulating what sets zest

334
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,630
and zeal

335
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,460
that they really were on the way to
growing up

336
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,220
and becoming the thought leaders at the
next generation that

337
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,400
is your charges well those of you who
are ya

338
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,430
those if you are 1514 16

339
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,570
now at my age I think sixty is your
shifty is young forties and thirties

340
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,330
young

341
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,230
20 is young up all of those niches

342
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,720
in time as we constituted I

343
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,500
our platforms on which you must
continually

344
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,820
gather together the consensus reality of
the people with whom you work

345
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,000
and understand it in order to transcend
it

346
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,010
in other words you have to know from
standing outside

347
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,390
how people build their consensus in
which they then stake

348
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,630
is reality which they think that
paradigm

349
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,930
Ultraflex they think the model of
reality in their heads

350
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,960
is 121 the reality external to the

351
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,050
and therefore act as if what they think
Israel

352
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,510
in other words they believe if their
beliefs

353
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:42,810
that is the greatest danger in this
kinda radically changing world yes see

354
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,840
we have to believe in our police to some
extent

355
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,930
we have to no what our beliefs are

356
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,570
we have to know ourselves and from
whence calms

357
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,860
our police but if you believe in your
politics

358
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,360
then they own you in the same way that
you don't speak a language

359
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,470
your language speaks you and you find
yourself able to formulate thinking

360
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,900
thoughts cognitive artifacts only in the
language that is speaking you

361
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,110
and that's why I care to German poet
said anyone who speaks just one language

362
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,050
speaks no language at all because
learning a second language

363
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,370
is a way to see how the first language

364
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,360
formed in framed in modified your
ability to think in the first place

365
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,580
well in the same way only believing

366
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,410
the consensus reality is your time %uh

367
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,990
is it way too avoid knowing what other
possibilities

368
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,230
can be a instantiated now

369
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,350
that's critical because when you stand
outside the consensus reality

370
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,100
your time up a

371
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,000
wisdom and insanity being in textual

372
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,690
you will seem to the people inside the
consensus reality

373
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,750
as if you're crazy I'll let me let me
quote

374
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,400
John Galvin Robert Galvin who headed
motorola

375
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,080
many years ago he was a terrific

376
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,780
thought leader as well as administrator
and entrepreneur

377
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,400
and after forty years work which had
resulted

378
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,380
in Motorola at that time having
significant breakthrough technologies

379
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,050
he was asked which ideas made the
biggest difference

380
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,040
and he thought for a moment and he said
you know

381
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,280
the idea is that always made the biggest
difference began their life

382
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,630
as minority opinions if it was a
minority of one

383
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,940
they would speak something in a meeting
and everyone

384
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,000
wouldn't even hear it if you're all the
consensus reality

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,200
you can't hear the new possibilities

386
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,610
as if they are real but if that person
repeated them again and again

387
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,400
they heard it and they left because
within the consensus rocks don't fall

388
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,850
from the sky said the Academy of Science
in

389
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,550
entrance therefore the data meteorites
can't possibly be true

390
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,850
and they laughed at the villagers for
being sufficiently naive

391
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,170
and duped to believe that rocks fell
from the sky

392
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,460
well then after the person keeps saying
it after villages keep bringing you

393
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,920
boxes have rocks that fell from the sky
you get angry at

394
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,960
because now they're threatening you're
threatening

395
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,600
and confronting they're very way of
thinking about reality and that's when

396
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,570
people in the audience stand up and say
to me

397
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,270
stop I don't want to hear that I don't
wanna know that

398
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,750
that's a sign that you're on the edge
about

399
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,460
to move of the cusp into a new reality
because someone water retreat

400
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,240
other religious world is a great example
ovett what a retreat

401
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,800
into a thought world which no longer
exists

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,180
but which they walk to exist in order to
order

403
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,370
and construct a more comfortable world

404
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,410
then when you're confronting them with
by giving them

405
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,560
new data and then after you keep
presenting that data after rocks fall

406
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,290
from the sky

407
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,780
time and time again finally everyone
admits

408
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,570
not only the rocks fell from the sky but
they say that we believe that to be true

409
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,950
all law well galvin

410
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,020
went on to say I the corollary of his
insight is

411
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,230
is also true that when everyone comes
into a meeting in the first place

412
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,540
and everybody agrees on a solution right
away

413
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,430
he said don't listen to this he said it
was always wrong he said it was

414
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,760
always wrong always wrong

415
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,310
this is Robert Galvin not me saying

416
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,680
that the easy initial solution to a
confounding problem

417
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,530
if everyone agreed on what it was right
away was always wrong

418
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,610
now in light of what I can tell you
about models reality in paradise

419
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,170
a think it think about what he was
really saying is saying

420
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,210
everyone in the room the eight people
around the table

421
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,920
share consensus reality and they all

422
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,730
act out and think out %uh that consensus
reality

423
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,350
inevitably their solutions are going to
be congruent

424
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,380
with that consensus reality because

425
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,930
any other solution causes immediate
cognitive dissonance causes

426
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,320
pain causes distress causes

427
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,850
anxiety in the face things I D people
become fearful

428
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,870
and when they become fearful they become
isolated

429
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,410
from one another and they can't speak or
communicate to one another

430
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,760
and they become more and more rigid and
that is what

431
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,820
one response to radical change upped

432
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,670
can create but if you are already on the
edge

433
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,930
like the Terminator and the bone you
know about that

434
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,290
right where the lineup light/dark meet

435
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,020
is where you can see the mountains where
you can see the reels the craters

436
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,250
in the whiteness everything is blurred
out in white

437
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,740
in the darkness everything is invisible
but right on the edge with a light in

438
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,760
the darkness meet

439
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,950
you can see and that's what's so when
creating the new possibilities

440
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,220
%uh that's where they live that's what
they see they see definition

441
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,000
they see possibility and by saying it
they do

442
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,670
a creative act it fundamentally is
consistent YouTube

443
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,940
up the economic political social and
religious realities

444
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,740
with subsequent generations well then
come to share

445
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,600
now generations are shorter and shorter

446
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,050
and this is why vigilance as well as
mindfulness

447
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,060
is essential the antidote

448
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,800
to those things that I said some retreat
from

449
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,290
by becoming more rigid and isolated and
fearful

450
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:46,140
up and lacking the ability to
communicate and that isolation rigidity

451
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,010
the antidote to that is always

452
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,480
same it is I organizational structures

453
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,550
collaborative structures network
structures based on mutuality

454
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,560
that is knowing you are no data network
knowing you don't know what all knowing

455
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,020
you can't know it all

456
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,010
and therefore knowing you must rely on
others to provide the pieces you don't

457
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,560
know

458
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,090
and don't have oh and and also

459
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,310
you have to have a lot of feedback when
I say be vigilant

460
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,920
I mean you have to really pay attention
to what's happening

461
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,700
not figure this system I've describing
the complexity of any system

462
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,140
is due to the speed information

463
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,150
into and out of that system the more
there is

464
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,340
and the faster it moves and the more
complex it becomes

465
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,080
and the more complex it becomes the more

466
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,950
in order to know what is really
happening it is required that you have

467
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,380
loops a feedback

468
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,740
both inside the system to monitor all
the internal dynamics of the system

469
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,050
as well it's through the porous
boundaries to the outside the system

470
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,980
and ultimately we know now from the
world of physics and astronomy in

471
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,950
cosmology

472
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,490
that there is just one system we still
call it the universe

473
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,240
but that's all think it is probably
possibly

474
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,770
a multiverse or multiverse is %uh

475
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,140
it is not just three dimensions we move
too far with general relativity

476
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,180
but now we have in what is called balk a
fifth dimension

477
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,440
posited as a brain onto which gravity
leaks

478
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,150
which accounts for the weakness gravity
in our four dimensional

479
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,360
reality and there may be according to
string theory

480
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,740
up to what 11 or 12 dimensions which is
currently given our current evolution in

481
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,330
thinking

482
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,720
our brains currently literally
unthinkable

483
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,030
like grasping quantum reality is
unthinkable

484
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,610
to the brain that's been socialized and
trained by

485
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,900
this macro world in in

486
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,090
which we live and so this poses

487
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,130
up daunting challenges but it says why
you have to be

488
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,190
accountable the and those are the three
things you have to be you have to

489
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,600
no you can't do it alone and choose your
colleagues and friends

490
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,060
wisely and interact with them in a
meritocracy

491
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,200
in which you are vigilant and mindful

492
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,710
you have to get frequent feedback inside
your systems

493
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,920
but also know that your systems are
always inadequate

494
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,370
and partial description to reality and
so you must be getting fried back as

495
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,780
frequently as possible

496
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,820
from outside the system as well and
together you must be accountable

497
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,430
shear values were at least got the
hacker assess the scientific SS

498
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,030
shear values and and year and to your
vision

499
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,360
so hats

500
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,540
that's a start of what you have to do
going forward

501
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,690
and its a asking you out a

502
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,070
to make a profound effort to

503
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,460
mobilize olive your resources on

504
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,170
be half doing that up because the you
know the future is just not going to be

505
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,070
what it was let let me give you an
example that this is where I began

506
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:03,830
but I want to emphasize its where you're
going I want to talk about

507
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,330
the world religions all of them not only
Islam

508
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,140
Christianity buddhism and Judy -ism

509
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,690
Confucianism and Shintoism and

510
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,910
all of the other religions the world
where there are so many are there

511
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,450
there are so many and each one claims to
be the exclusive troops

512
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,370
well then if one is the exclusive choose
it shuts out

513
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,140
all the other voices and damson condemns
them

514
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,940
now and forever up to eternal damnation

515
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,880
all do it christians call them

516
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,810
a heretic send demonic and ball
worshipers

517
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,980
you know what Muslims call them jus call
them be

518
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,680
gentiles the other those not included

519
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,310
in in the Select elite who receive

520
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,810
the commandments from God %uh

521
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,980
every religion has a way of defining
itself as the exclusive truth

522
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,070
but obviously I think can all be the
exclusive troops

523
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,700
and yet they all coexist it's like a
radio

524
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,810
this playing

525
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,470
16 stations at the same time and you
just want to listen to the music

526
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,270
of the one station that lets you dance
well

527
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,970
sorry boys and girls a

528
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,380
that's just not true if you believe

529
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,130
in your beliefs too strongly you

530
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,790
make yourself incapable are seeing the
light

531
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:37,720
with clarity and grace and ease

532
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,910
the light which comes from being freed
from an inordinate

533
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,550
about belief in our own police what's
that got to do with hackers technology

534
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,970
well this is where I started

535
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,710
as I said because I used to be a
clergyman

536
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,950
many years ago and I perceived

537
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,210
as the technological revolution advanced
that it was going to because that was my

538
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,970
domain of thinking and understanding

539
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,300
it was going to transform religion and
it was a short

540
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,950
leaped to this insect there are four
stages

541
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,670
afar religions owners the first first
emerged when we spoke

542
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:16,150
when speech which we can call
metaphorically

543
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,540
a technology of the word when speech
emerged

544
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,580
up those who couldn't speak were
immediately

545
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,430
removed from the gene pool because
speech gives us

546
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,050
as we are doing now up such a leg up

547
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,970
on people who cannot understand and any
language

548
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:38,150
speaking became axiomatic or just

549
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,240
automatic for human beings and we first
got

550
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,670
that it was a creation in that case
genetic evolution

551
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,700
creation but creation nevertheless that

552
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,200
contrasted with how things had always
been before gestures in grants

553
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,410
I and vocals words

554
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,500
in from team sent tongues and pallets in
airways

555
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,310
%uh became a means of transmitting
meaning

556
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,360
we internalize speech and listening

557
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,130
creative listening as so essential to
the human project that we don't even see

558
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,100
it anymore

559
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,480
nothing is more invisible then things
which we believe so deeply

560
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,530
that we have lost our ability to stand
outside them and see them for what they

561
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,060
are

562
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,020
well that change strategy

563
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,860
would writing emerged because writing
transform human consciousness

564
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,120
and it is no accident that the founders

565
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,370
or leaders or got heads all of those
religions I named

566
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,490
a merge in human consciousness during

567
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,030
the emergency writing Ennis
internalization

568
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,940
in a way that transform human identity
which became

569
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,440
as speech had invisible to who we are
and how we are

570
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,470
so whether it's Buddha or

571
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,930
Moses or Jesus or Mohammed

572
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,240
or Confucius or gloves to what happened
to them

573
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,810
was that each one was a living
flesh-and-blood human being

574
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,920
was transformed into text

575
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,030
that is once they were all dead

576
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,120
the only way we knew about them was to

577
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,600
here written text or read

578
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,040
written text and that meant we'd learned
to engage

579
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,760
with the persona and if you will the
avatar

580
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,070
the Avatar geez the Avatar Moses the
Avatar Mohammed

581
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,290
we engaged with the avatar the textual
representation

582
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,370
is if we were engaging with the living
human being the text came alive in a new

583
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:40,920
way

584
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,080
and those who didn't have writing well
what happened to all those are religions

585
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,150
the that were

586
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,940
a predominant during the time speech
they either were turned in a written

587
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,410
religions the people have the book a
merging from the people the anecdote

588
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,100
or they disappeared they either were
transformed into

589
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,200
parks our halls up written written
religions

590
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,980
are they went away that happen again
when the printing press emerged in the

591
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,020
1400

592
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,460
and transform how people understand
themselves and it began happening again

593
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,960
about two hundred years ago

594
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,020
with the Telegraph out which inaugurated
the world of electronic communication

595
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,890
information

596
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,780
and to be in the world up the internet
which is a Sat is already no longer a

597
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,330
word that designates

598
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,410
are ubiquitous experience of being
always on

599
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:35,320
and always nodes in the network up this
electronic communication

600
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,349
electronic technologies have information

601
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:41,689
have once again transform who we
fundamentally are

602
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:45,749
so in that world of text how you saw to
future jack trees through life

603
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:50,869
was linear connecting the dots if your
life and you generally persisted on that

604
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:51,689
trajectory

605
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:54,759
for a long time not so anymore

606
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,109
now the world with which we engage on
the net

607
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:01,309
is interactive it is modular

608
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,329
and it is fluid and as a result

609
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,309
our sense of ourselves are very
identities have become

610
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:13,410
interactive as I said dependent on being
nodes in a network in interacting with

611
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,279
other nodes

612
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:18,499
modular in other words they are pieces
that we

613
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:22,999
recognize are good enough for now how
you think if your cells

614
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:27,029
is good enough for now but it's not
going to be good enough for next

615
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:30,579
that's where you have to be mindful and
vigilant

616
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,319
because the data will be coming in from
the biological reconstruction

617
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,599
and changes if human beings from the
Nano technological reconstruction

618
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,519
and changes if human beings it will be
coming in so fast

619
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,519
that unless you pay attention to how it
is altering you

620
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,099
you will become mired in the viewpoint

621
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,499
of the past and so

622
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:57,869
your charge is to live on that edge with
courage

623
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,150
and with bigger and with

624
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,929
S falling awareness as you possibly can
see it's not just about

625
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:10,449
a learning techniques up information
security back in the day

626
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:13,660
when everybody came to it through a
different discipline

627
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,869
was a infinitely fertile and a human
being could mastered all just as if

628
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:23,359
just as in the seventeen hundreds that
was the last time the human being could

629
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,539
know all of Western knowledge

630
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:29,049
one person could no everything that had
been pretty much learned

631
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,939
not anymore and the same is true for
information security

632
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:38,939
in the day hacker could no all the
aspects in the system sufficiently well

633
00:38:38,939 --> 00:38:42,019
to master dominating not anymore

634
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,380
now we have degrees in information
technology

635
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,769
now we have certifications in
information technology

636
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,290
and now we have specialist

637
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,690
Asian in aspects up a

638
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,990
security technology security up

639
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,220
which are up so specialized

640
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,340
and so partial that you camp master at
all

641
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,500
you major in or up up

642
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,750
live in one domain or maybe two or three

643
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,920
and this points to the necessity

644
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,240
across disciplinary knowledge going
forward %uh

645
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,570
even the names the things we think we
know

646
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,890
the names of the domains have knowledge
that we believe exist

647
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,670
are changing rapidly there's so much
published

648
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,510
now as a result of the revolution in so
many domains

649
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,750
that even those who live in those
domains cannot master

650
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,810
they cannot read physically all love it
therefore

651
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:48,970
if you define that domain as if you
define being present

652
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,070
as opposed to living in the past as
being current

653
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,680
on everything in your domain expertise
i'm saying that

654
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,450
even if your master per domain you live
a little bit behind the press it

655
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,040
you live to some degree in the past

656
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,550
you can't help it because you can't know

657
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,800
everything that is known ethic quote
president that lineup

658
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,860
mastery which we call the president the
present and in the other domains

659
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,950
where you are not masters up your way
back in the past and therefore

660
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,370
everybody in this in the past to some
degree in some people live in the past

661
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,770
in

662
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,200
all ways and all manners and that is the
consensus reality

663
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,890
which they think still defines what is
real

664
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,870
so what is the future that well if you
live in the past

665
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:42,870
other the present looks like the future
to you I'm sometimes defined as a

666
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,530
futurist I laugh at that

667
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,010
I say I try to get my mind around as
much as the present as I can

668
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,200
but if you live in the past I will sound
like a futurist

669
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,980
to you future is a construction of
reality

670
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,930
get this there is no future separate
from the creative back to the human

671
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,380
being

672
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,340
and the evidence from the paranormal
world from Paris ecology in remote

673
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,710
viewing

674
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,690
wrongly to suggest it's a future already
exists

675
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:13,210
insert missed and she asians and
influences the present

676
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,910
influences the present even if you don't
believe that

677
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,300
take hold it because it's a way of
saying the

678
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,550
by it's a way of saying that the frame

679
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,300
and the former the future sorry this
Andre up

680
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,920
the frame in the form in the future is
the mold

681
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,230
of present thinking which in turn

682
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,240
changes what you thought was real in the
past

683
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,859
and therefore because no one can know
fully in the present in all domains or

684
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,660
even in their own domain to best re

685
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,420
collaboration and cross-disciplinary
knowledge

686
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,770
is essential it's not just important if
you don't do it

687
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,460
%uh week she you just lost you're gone

688
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,730
and that's why that president ok MIT

689
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,109
that woman in whatever first addresses
to the student body

690
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,280
emphasize the cross disciplinary
knowledge was essential

691
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,849
in order to function effectively going
forward

692
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:18,230
she was saying in effect you can't know
everything therefore you need rely on

693
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,730
those

694
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:24,099
will know more than you do and let's go
back to mutuality and feedback

695
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:28,060
what else does it resulted except
collaborative work

696
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,520
mutuality of effort frequent feedback
into and out of the system which is

697
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,349
defined arbitrarily at different levels
of complexity

698
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:39,820
and accountability to your intention and
task

699
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,380
that accountability that intentional
task is going to be derived

700
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,530
from the good old hacker us and if you
don't understand what that is

701
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,170
I strongly encourage you a to you google
it

702
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,250
and so when my son

703
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,080
graduated from Northwestern University
up

704
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,450
about twenty-five years ago they named
all the different degrees before getting

705
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,140
pasture arts and history or philosophy
or whatever

706
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,369
and they said at the end we have one ad
hoc major

707
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:16,280
and everybody laughed because when you
invent new realities to fit the

708
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,910
consensus the times

709
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,830
people do left remember what Galvin said

710
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:26,390
and what he really was doing was
instantiating what was necessary going

711
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,890
forward he just saw it faster

712
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,190
he created a major for himself got
symbolic system studies that had

713
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:36,040
artificial intelligence in computer
science and math and philosophy and

714
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,580
cognitive psychology in it

715
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,580
and he went around all those different
departments which were named according

716
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,020
to the wisdom in the past and knowledge
in the past

717
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,350
and combined pieces have them into a new
reality which he got symbolic system

718
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,920
studies which is now a major

719
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,950
at a number of universities so that
kinda ad hoc

720
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:59,000
ability to creatively InterBase the
different disciplines and then stand on

721
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,110
that going forward

722
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,240
%uh that crosses when they re

723
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,580
work that cross disciplinary knowledge
is

724
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,690
axiomatic to what hacking requires from
you in the past

725
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,140
you have to have a clue as to what's
going on in nando

726
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,640
and materials science you have to have a
clue as to what is going on in the

727
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,690
military world

728
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,950
you have to have a clue as to what
children are playing with

729
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,540
because these are the way society
communicates to its yuan

730
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,320
the knowledge of what they need to study
going forward

731
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,330
I'm good at I at least through these
papers here to see if I could

732
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:38,840
a fight that I found the right away what
I saw actually was years ago dow

733
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,910
I was waiting in line for a movie
theater and it was near the

734
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,560
up museum here in the city I live in

735
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,880
and the shop love the museum had a sign
on the window saying

736
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,530
these are the things II see

737
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:55,880
I let me click that off these are the
things you need to

738
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,960
play with ineffective said these are the
choices we have in the games we have

739
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,490
and had a list eleven I'm gonna read it
to you it said

740
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:08,620
of word of world gear weapons for the
money

741
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,660
cyber pets ID and generators

742
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,470
cosmic debris alien life forms

743
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,800
space junk space armor

744
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,000
saw reactors that was the list of things
they said you should be playing with

745
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,570
well society knows what we don't know is
individuals yet

746
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,779
and it says

747
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:34,539
as as when Seymour peppered invented
Mindstorms and

748
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:38,579
combined Legos with CPU's I knew
robotics

749
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,739
was going to be major in the future but
here it is

750
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:47,529
because society communicates in the form
above its toys in the name seven stories

751
00:45:47,529 --> 00:45:50,949
as their sin and the on the museum
window did

752
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:55,469
what you're going to have to know going
forward thinking what those are of World

753
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:56,089
Beer

754
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,900
no wonder I caught it practice for a
transplant a Terry society in the 21st

755
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,829
century

756
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:05,779
we know we're not alone in the universe
some of us who study

757
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,819
UFO phenomena as I have for years and as

758
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:12,309
results it one result is way most recent
book

759
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:15,369
you deposit government a sixty year
study

760
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:19,390
how the government's up the world
responded to the phenomena of UFO's

761
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,140
we don't know exactly what they are yet
certainly not out here

762
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,539
we don't know what that phenomena is
about but what we do know

763
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:29,739
is that it is a phenomena it is real it

764
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:34,409
manifests physics or reality is that we
can understand

765
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:38,559
you remember I think our any
technologies officially fired vans

766
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,579
will seem like magic to people have
gotten there we don't know

767
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:48,019
but it seems to indicate means a
manipulating a distorting space-time

768
00:46:48,019 --> 00:46:51,279
means have trans dimensional movement

769
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:55,640
and means that possibly transitioning in
the multiverse

770
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,999
from one scheme universal life to
another

771
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,729
we don't know quite what those means was
mean

772
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:07,809
and I'm just beginning to get my mind
around the meeting at the terms I just

773
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:11,059
use so when you're confronted by

774
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:14,489
of world airspace amber alien life forms

775
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,849
we're not just talking about science
fiction we're talking about what it is

776
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:20,869
essential to factory in

777
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:25,489
to human consciousness which has been
going through a transformation of phase

778
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:26,479
for many many

779
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:31,009
abedi decades I mention the world have
the paranormal in terms of remote

780
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:31,569
viewing

781
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:36,479
well remote viewing is an established
fact remote viewing is the ability to

782
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:41,390
articulate the results and clairvoyance
using structured protocols

783
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,220
that identified physical realities is
sufficient

784
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,680
bridge precision to be beyond up the
possibility of chants

785
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,240
it is a fundamental human characteristic

786
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,300
to be able to do it and that brings us
back to how do you free the mind

787
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,500
if you don't believe in something you
don't allow that data or the evidence

788
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,810
for to surface in your own braids

789
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,590
but if you do and you know it is
possible

790
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,780
and you know it is real then you are
giving a message to your own unconscious

791
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,800
to all loud knowledge in those fax to
surface into consciousness

792
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,950
so that you can get your higher mind
around them your conscious mind what we

793
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,250
think of as ourselves

794
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,450
but which we know is the tip of the
iceberg it lets you get your mind around

795
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,530
those things

796
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,980
in a way that lets you use them by
enabling them

797
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,690
by empowering them to be real and
nothing is more clear

798
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,740
then the domain of the what we used to
call the paranormal but I call

799
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,660
%uh normal the world of clairvoyance and
telepathy

800
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,550
and non-local consciousness in which

801
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,080
individual on at Ecole consciousness

802
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,420
such as we thought we were the soleus

803
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,839
into an awareness again that universally

804
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,760
throughout the multiverse we are nodes
in the network

805
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,530
and the information that moves from one
node to another

806
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,580
does not obey the laws of us space and
time that is it is not

807
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,750
like up electromagnetic signals to
degrade

808
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,530
as a function in the distance between to
points

809
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,230
it is what we used to call instantaneous
although we should have burned 200 years

810
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:22,790
ago

811
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,260
with general relativity that
instantaneous today at:

812
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,150
instantaneous events is a misnomer
because nothing is instantaneous

813
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:35,010
in space-time it was in
three-dimensional space

814
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,420
because time was what is timing
dimension

815
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,680
do you know what time is we don't know
what time

816
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,760
is one of the things hackers are going
to do

817
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,859
moving forward is hack the new

818
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,599
conceptual possibilities of space-time

819
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,700
as redefined for multiple dimensions

820
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,460
now information which is the

821
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,890
varies stuff a Packard is moving

822
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:05,690
differently in their construction of
reality that in the construction reality

823
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:09,070
we used to inhabit which is why quantum
computing

824
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,760
is moving ahead by leaps and bounds up

825
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,290
bounds according to both nation-states
and

826
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:22,970
individuals so this poses a real
challenges doesn't it

827
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:28,400
men and women collegial privileged
people that we are

828
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,740
to be able to talk to one another about
these issues %uh

829
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,119
I go back more than a hundred years to
what Nichi a set about this

830
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,380
up this fact that I've been enunciated

831
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,290
he said it well he said you must
articulate

832
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,990
untimely truths untimely choose

833
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:51,339
I does emerge intrudes which do not
belong to the consensus reality if your

834
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:51,980
time

835
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,920
in which your untimely because they
won't get you call crazy

836
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,830
and waco and all the other things that
the context

837
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,990
doesn't support but therefore you must
use those

838
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,839
untimely truths tech act upon your time

839
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,160
for the benefit a future time that
future time as I said

840
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,109
is already here but most people don't
know it Gibson said the future

841
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:24,250
is here but it's unevenly distributed

842
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,030
was wave making the same point so

843
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,650
Europe you'll be up against what I call
to my short story

844
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:35,849
a break memory the complex those ninety
percent of the world who live in the

845
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:36,960
home but the bell curve

846
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,339
and want to take refuge in a bar of you

847
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:44,070
that comforts them because what is truth

848
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,550
need she said well I'll a

849
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,810
what someone calls true in the face a
cognitive dissonance is not what is

850
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,089
necessarily true

851
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:56,420
up he said when a new property emerge
property

852
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,660
is is visible it confronts people

853
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,480
in a way that generates cognitive
dissonance is painful

854
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,800
it's distressing and what do they do

855
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,220
automatically in such a moment they

856
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,950
try to

857
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,760
reassert or assert a worldview a belief
system

858
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,460
which eliminates the cognitive
dissonance by roughing out

859
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,440
the new reality smoothing although rough
edges that the new realities

860
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,880
confront them with I having to deal with
if they want to

861
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,300
tree their minds and they take refuge

862
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,160
in the construction of reality which the
VA said dissidents

863
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,060
and makes them feel more comfortable
that's why people stand up and say as I

864
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,599
said

865
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,740
I don't know that up because it makes
them uncomfortable

866
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,480
and they want to assert a reality which
makes them comfortable

867
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,390
and then they share that reality by
articulating it to one another

868
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,770
and the result of that is consensus
reality

869
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,760
a paradigm for model in which people
hunkered down

870
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,410
which they call the troops and the truth

871
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:06,800
therefore is an invisible shield like
that

872
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,550
it keeps out those uncomfortable are
distressed causing

873
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,050
new realities that it is your
Providence's hackers

874
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,270
to not only see as they emerge but to
create

875
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,290
not only in the maneuver and
manipulation

876
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,530
AppData and physical reality

877
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,970
and biological reality but in the naming
their up

878
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,730
which is a said is a creative there so

879
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,099
I think I'ma just about toward the

880
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:42,200
and above my time with you shame after
the box is going the way of all flesh

881
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,150
but all things do change

882
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,099
and if temporality were held to be
invalid dating than nothing

883
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,260
real exists use your

884
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,540
power I'm gonna cause with two quotes
one

885
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,960
is definition a power from Charles reich
that I really like power he said

886
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,940
means to me the same thing is freedom
powers the thing that everyone has the

887
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,720
most I've

888
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,290
that they can possibly have anything
that comes out of you and goes into the

889
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,560
world is power

890
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,980
when you reach out to another human
being through your energy or creativity

891
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,109
and another response you are exercising
power

892
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:23,060
when you make someone else do something
against their will

893
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,220
even if you can

894
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,020
system a bit that is not power thats
force

895
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,190
enforces indication have power so
remember

896
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,230
what George Bernard Shaw said %ah

897
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,520
galvin he said up

898
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,000
built in an open this to heresy all
great truths

899
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,090
begin is blasphemy and relate that to
what I said about religious structures

900
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:52,170
which are breaking down in the face of
something larger

901
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,520
and transcended and Shah said this is
the true joy in life

902
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,300
to be yours for purpose recognized by
yourself is a mighty one

903
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,420
to be a force of nature and not a
selfish

904
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,680
feverish little caught avail mincing
grievances complains the world will not

905
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,420
devote itself to make you happy

906
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,599
my life belongs to the whole world he
said

907
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,030
and as long as I live it is my privilege
to do for it

908
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,990
whatever I can I wanna be thoroughly
used up

909
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,430
when I die the harder I work

910
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,670
the more I live I rejoice in I for its
own sake

911
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:30,839
it is no brief candle for me it is a
kind a splendid torch

912
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:35,510
which I have holed up for only one
moment and I wanted to burn as brightly

913
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,540
as possible

914
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,530
before handing it to future generations
that has been the essence is my

915
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,690
participation

916
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,270
with you in this enterprise we call
hacking

917
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:49,830
but which is so much more and make
arrangements to you

918
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:55,030
a sack in the box fayed's into memory is
that you adopt

919
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,780
this understanding have your purpose in
life as well

920
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:02,460
thank you so much for allowing me

921
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,010
to be with you hopefully I will be back
in Malaysia

922
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:09,450
in the flesh another time but meanwhile

923
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,089
this is my avatar signing out
