1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,100
no hack in the box truly ends without us

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:24,089
inviting Dylan Ladakh an aberrant to the

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:26,519
stage to deliver his lock note all good

4
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,929
guys I don't know how much time we have

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,299
oh we actually have no time so really

6
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:34,858
seven o'clock so okay no no no no I make

8
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,370
all the speakers for being here one of

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,260
the most fantastic lineup of talks we've

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,510
had bar none

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,010
we had a peer review board sitting here

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,629
they can verify this 200 plus

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,339
submissions super super hard to select

14
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,010
big thank you obviously to all of the

15
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:54,420
villages that showed up we invited some

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,550
of you guys come down obviously some

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,519
usual suspects were here Mitch thank you

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,349
so much for your support all these years

19
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,379
big tanks obviously to all our sponsors

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:09,060
who made the event possible thanks to

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:13,320
their contributions and most importantly

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,110
to the crew for sticking this true even

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,529
though we had the birds claws on us at 9

24
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,539
p.m. the night of set up when we

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,660
normally would have the venue all the

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,510
way till 6 a.m. so that means we had to

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,030
bugger off at 9 o'clock come back at

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,860
6:30 in the morning and you guys showed

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,470
up here for my opening you know at 8:30

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,600
so we had like two hours to essentially

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,300
do well six and a half hours worth of

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,050
work so big round of applause to all of

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:52,020
the crew all of the volunteers

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:56,070
phenomenal phenomenal so I think this

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,140
really quick next up Singapore G SEC

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,899
conference it's gonna be our fifth

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,850
anniversary there obviously we're not

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,890
going to do a crazy conference like this

39
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,470
mainly because Singapore and jisuk is

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,720
meant to be a bit more intimate it's

41
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,000
designed where you as the audience as

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,450
the people who come and attend get to

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,580
shape the agenda so normally we decide

44
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,519
as in the CIP review board and I push

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,100
them a little bit pick the talks but at

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
jisuk the concept is slightly different

47
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,459
so you we put the voting power in your

48
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,709
hands we do a pre selection you guys

49
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,630
ultimately get to decide and you get to

50
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,620
meet the speakers like one-on-one and

51
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,019
get to hang out with them you get to

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,790
talk to them so it's a little bit of a

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,930
different event worth attending if you

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,030
never been the dates 26 to the 28th will

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,610
have the usual training 29 30th will be

56
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,470
the conference CFP is actually still

57
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,060
open so if you want to talk and you want

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,580
to speak you want something to board on

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,120
it feel free to submit go to CFP dot

60
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,130
hack in the box at all and you can find

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,530
out more about that on ji cyclohexyl TV

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,829
if you want to go for the event itself

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,330
now I'm sure most of you who have been

64
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,549
here for the last couple of days if you

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,590
are not at my opening keynote you might

66
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:08,910
have noticed this thing that you have no

67
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,910
idea what the hell is it about which was

68
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,250
the lounge that was in the middle of the

69
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,040
expo area and this big sign at the top

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,410
that said he hid b plus cyber week so

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,970
what exactly is hid be saga week I'm

72
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,560
guessing most of you were probably not

73
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,810
awake at 8:30 in the morning on day one

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,250
so I'm just gonna quickly play a little

75
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,840
video that we made which kind of

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,910
explains what it's all about

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,060
for this I need to go over here because

78
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:42,030
need to click on stuff let me see there

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:44,280
we go can I get some sound yeah there's

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,680
no sound doesn't matter

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,400
fine I'll walk you guys through it so

82
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,450
basically cyber week is a six day

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,950
extended event

84
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,089
so normally hack in the box we do

85
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,200
training and if we do the conference

86
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,330
right

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,480
what we're going to be doing for cyber

88
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,180
week in UAE is a joint collaborative

89
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,100
effort between the government and s and

90
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,890
we're trying to solve a kind of an

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:13,220
interesting problem one of the things

92
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,220
that we see basically right now is oops

93
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:20,130
this video thing doesn't really work so

94
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,609
great let me see if I can pause it at

95
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,380
some point the article basically what

96
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,360
we're trying to do if you've noticed

97
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,440
over the last couple of days upstairs we

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,060
have this thing called hack in the class

99
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,340
and we also have this thing next door

100
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,930
called hacker high school what you

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,419
didn't see is this other thing that we

102
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,920
do called edu CTF so we have the

103
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,870
professional CTF the thing that's

104
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,760
happening out there and we also do in

105
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,130
Singapore a contest that's meant for

106
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,560
university students in fact the winners

107
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,360
from Germany who won second place

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,940
they're actually University students

109
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,680
that won national level Germany

110
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,060
competition they were supposed to come

111
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,620
here and just enjoy the conference it

112
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,080
was a prize that it would come here and

113
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,250
chill out but we decided now then we're

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,530
gonna come here and like phone some

115
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,200
stuff so they came and played the CTF

116
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,750
but upstairs at HACC in the class and at

117
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,700
hacker high school it's an issue an

118
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,130
initiative that we started because we

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,990
feel that there's a big gap that

120
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,580
currently exists right the universities

121
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,030
are not producing graduates that are

122
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,289
readily employable and the problem is

123
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,719
not really going to be solved if we just

124
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,030
keep talking about it so we saw all

125
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,160
right fine let's try and see what what's

126
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,380
fundamentally missing right is that the

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,820
way that kids are being taught at a much

128
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,730
younger age even in high school and

129
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,650
university just doesn't really meet the

130
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,750
way that kids should be learning right

131
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,789
and they learn by experimentation so we

132
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,310
started hacking the class to try and

133
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,770
teach younger kids problem-solving you

134
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:47,910
know hacker mindset taught them some

135
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,620
electronics CDF we started edu CTF to

136
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,900
try and create a bridge so that

137
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,180
University students get an idea of what

138
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,760
it's like to be a hacker what it's like

139
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,070
to solve problems and you know work in a

140
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,210
team and then obviously to create that

141
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,130
bridge for that you can go into

142
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,609
professional games and you know play

143
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:08,790
with all the cool guys like espr

144
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,410
so in UAE we're taking this entire

145
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,720
concept and basically the government

146
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,760
said hey you know we like this idea that

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,160
you're kind of doing stuff for the

148
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,760
younger generation how can we make it

149
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,560
even cooler or even better so we came

150
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,320
back to them with some ideas and that

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
was pretty much how we we started with

152
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,099
this type of thing and so there are

153
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,350
actually four initiatives that are

154
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,190
planned the first of which is a edu

155
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,800
focused CTF where we are actually doing

156
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,330
more so we're going to be taking

157
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,860
University teams and high school teams

158
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,109
from the UAE we're going to give them

159
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,410
some training some scratch course

160
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,700
basically in all sorts of stuff and then

161
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,520
we're gonna give them a japanese-style

162
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,729
CTF for them to play with they'll go on

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,159
to play a final CTF competition of some

164
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,810
sort I can attack a defense game the

165
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,550
German winners from the German

166

competition the Belgian team will also

167
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,570
join them there and then the top two

168
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,280
teams from edu will play in a

169
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,610
professional game and for the

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,900
professional game were inviting the 25

171
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,760
top teams basically from around the

172
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,099
world so winners from Def Con for

173
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,630
example from code blue

174
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,640
the winners from hacking the box here

175
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,870
and we'll pick a bunch of other contests

176
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,510
we have a decider on all of that but

177
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,210
we'll pick some and they're all gonna be

178
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,469
flown over they get to can compete in

179
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,409
this contest that's going to be

180
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,830
happening there hundred thousand dollars

181
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:34,250
we also have an AI challenge we are

182
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,780
thinking about doing something for

183
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,580
machine learning because I like a I wish

184
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,679
in any stuff so we have a challenge for

185
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,570
malware like you can build you malware

186
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,940
it's like the we also have a deep

187
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,950
exploit stuff that's also you can build

188
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,670
a kind of automated scanner automated

189
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,280
pen testing thingy produce it it's like

190
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,870
50 thousand dollars that we have off for

191
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,789
a prize we're probably good in a catgirl

192
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,330
contest but for now it's for post grads

193
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,510
and undergrads we also have this new bug

194
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,500
bounty thing and that one is a it's an

195
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:10,050
interesting concept in a way because bug

196
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,970
bounties have been around obviously I

197
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,130
mean everybody knows it it's not a new

198
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,770
concept and as a whole but what we're

199
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,300
doing slightly differently is that we're

200
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,010
running our own individual contest

201
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,830
that's fine but we're also inviting

202
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,409
major stakeholders from

203
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:29,479
industry to host their contest alongside

204
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,640
us why if you're a bug hunter you have a

205
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,740
few different places you can go to and

206
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,809
drop your bugs few and far between

207
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,669
really what we're trying to do is to

208
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,400
kind of create like a one-stop Bazaar

209
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,780
like a market right like you can come

210
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,579
multiple different programs running you

211
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,850
can choose which program seems

212
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:50,000
interesting to you and then the vendor

213
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,580
gets obviously the findings you get your

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,380
payout but what's missing currently is

215
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,230
that a lot of this discussions this

216
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,330
stuff that happens during contests they

217
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,780
happen behind closed doors and so what

218
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,370
we're trying to do is to give the

219
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,040
vendors what they need give them time to

220
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,720
patch the pad comes out give an extra

221
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,750
say 30 days so the pad can be

222
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,700
distributed consumers get protected but

223
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,070
then thereafter we actually want to open

224
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,720
source to a certain extent pretty much

225
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,000
every single bit of the findings not

226
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,300
just the CVS but the actual exploit code

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,780
that was used for verification any of

228
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,910
the technical lower-level findings why

229
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,610
because basically techniques are much

230
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,469
more interesting than the actual exploit

231
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,860
itself I mean exploits are experts but

232
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,460
the technique will enable somebody else

233
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,190
to maybe

234
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,500
complete a chain that they're working on

235
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,690
and then they will also then be able to

236
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,150
come to above all the contests and win

237
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,260
some stuff and all of us get to benefit

238
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,260
as an industry will then move forward so

239
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,000
crazy ideas gotta try it

240
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,150
typical hack in the box style so that's

241
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
what we've got planned for the next big

242
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,150
thing that we normally announce what I

243
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,959
normally announce at the end of this

244
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,890
show it's going to be fun it's going to

245
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,490
be super interesting

246
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:14,090
I really hope all you guys be there it's

247
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,770
gonna be extraordinarily cool we're

248
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,020
gonna once again have all of the

249
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,860
villagers stuff that we have here

250
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,569
medical hacking village it's going to

251
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,550
have a huge huge area I was talking to

252
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,840
me now about it was super excited about

253
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,089
some stuff that were going to be doing

254
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,410
there I'm hoping which will also be

255
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,600
really will expand on that we're going

256
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,040
to do a huge hack in the class so I

257
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,580
really hope all of you guys will will

258
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,480
come CFT will open

259
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,850
in June I think probably June July

260
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,590

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,660
people to to share that knowledge

266
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,980
basically right we all know something we

267
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,329
might not be a subject matter expert and

268
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,900
everything under the Sun but we know

269
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,540

270
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,390
share it some idiot some it is a talk

271
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,709

272
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,960
need more content we need more people to

273
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,110
