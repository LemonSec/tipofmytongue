1
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,470
good afternoon everyone we are happy to

2
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,460
give a talk about the Andhra bandha the

3
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,460
Brigitte to Reuter

4
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,780
first we would like to introduce

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:49,130
ourselves this is my colleague who me

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:52,160
hello I'm Tony hi I'm mr. Kerr

7
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:57,230
researcher at the coaching of qihoo 360

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:03,769
row and I mainly falls on the USP and

9
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:07,720
Colonel by hunting and aspiration I am

10
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:12,408
Indian I'm the leader of core team

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:15,620
so what are the caught him do it's a

12
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:21,020
secretive Fox a group who started in the

13
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:23,120
middle of 2015 we focus on the Android

14
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,869
and Linux platforms the creative

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,399
research and aim to discover their day

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:37,930
vulnerabilities develop ooh POC and each

17
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:41,719
part we have found more than 200 CBE in

18
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,759
2017 since we submitted so many

19
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:49,189
high-quality reports through Google and

20
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:56,180
Ravi RP reaches our team as a and draw

21
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:59,449
12 research team this slide I would like

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:04,969
to introduce what Bandar is and why

23
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:09,229
Bandar Panda is an Android specific IPC

24
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:13,730
mechanism is implemented as a driver in

25
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:18,830
the kernel here is a simple architecture

26
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:21,350
of Bandar IPC its user for nearly

27
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,590
everything that happens across processes

28
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,549
in the core platform

29
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:34,599
what's more Bandar was accepted in

30
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:37,280
demanding exokernel in February of 2015

31
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,339
Bandar is so important

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:47,600
that is one of the most attractive

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:50,750
attack service on and Roger we have done

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,380
some work around the bender driver for

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:58,840
example we analyze the the possible

36
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:04,540
attack surface by code oddity and fuzzy

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:10,690
we are lucky and find some bugs like CVE

38
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:15,109
202 5 and other zero day vulnerabilities

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:20,380
furthermore we if product them to gain

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,380
the systems and route privilege

41
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:29,208
especially the CVE 202 file with this

42
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:35,900
single vulnerability we do to the latest

43
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:39,110
pixel 3 Excel as far as we know it's the

44
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:45,890
first time the pixel 3 XL has been

45
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:55,580
rooted next I would like to introduce a

46
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:58,309
good cause of CBE 202 file first I would

47
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:04,130
like to talk about some basic background

48
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:07,930
knowledge about the Panda IPC simplee

49
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,100
there are 4 steps during the banda IPC

50
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,590
step step 1

51
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,040
the client sends the bc transaction to

52
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:20,180
the driver step to the server reads of

53
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:24,530
PR transaction from the driver step 3

54
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:30,560
the server since the bc reply to the

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:37,260
driver step 4 the clients raiser be our

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:41,260
reply from the driver a client

57
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:45,760
the driver and the server share the same

58
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:49,380
physical physical memory the client Maps

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:54,420
a memory to its own address space and

60
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:58,409
access a - with a user point the driver

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:01,300
access the memory with a kernel function

62
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:08,710
there is a mapping between the Honu

63
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:13,350
pointer under the user pointer the

64
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:18,239
driver uses estructure vendor buffer -

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,240
describes a buffer user for transaction

66
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,640
when the serviceand

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:28,050
PC replying to the driver what happened

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,900
in himself and the driver a driver

69
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,510
allocates a band before objection under

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:41,710
done car pays a reply data to the buffer

71
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:43,659
data window client since the BC free

72
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,770
buffer and the user pointer to the

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:51,160
driver what happened in the driver the

74
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:55,630
driver Maps a user point to the corner

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:59,710
point finds out the band abhava objector

76
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:02,800
relates the ways of Qunu pointer other

77
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:12,630
than free the bathroom and the de banda

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:12,630
baja objector so there is a question

79
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,280
what happened

80
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,460
if client tries to free the reply

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:27,229
powerful while server is doing busy

82
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,229
reply if there are any protection

83
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,740
unfortunately the answer is no there is

84
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:37,400
no luck to protect the Panda buffer

85
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,400
objection

86
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:46,049
after the objector is educated they are

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,810
either with window we can free the band

88
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:55,879
above and the bar for objection before

89
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,879
is used this would lead to a UAF problem

90
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:08,789
with UAF bug even around the

91
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:11,400
vulnerability because we can do the

92
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:16,050
arbitrary right when Stovall calling

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:25,049
copy from user because T buffer is

94
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:28,379
controlled and also we can do the

95
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,939
arbitrary read when clients calling copy

96
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:36,860
to user because T buffer and T bar for

97
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,860
targets are controlled

98
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:50,639
what's more leaking kernel symbol is

99
00:07:44,370 --> 00:08:00,960
very easy T bhavati bharata the style of

100
00:07:50,639 --> 00:08:02,909
cell cell and data are all dictum panda

101
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,049
is so powerful and the so is a

102
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:11,250
vulnerability with this vulnerability we

103
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,240
can do arbitrary read write universal

104
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:19,400
rules

105
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,800
especially sandbox is keeping it affects

106
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,479
Android devices in recent to two years

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,030
so we gave the vulnerability a name

108
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,340
water drop

109
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,848
what drop comes from the fiction the

110
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,098
three-body problem the water drop

111
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,680
destroyed and nearly all over the earth

112
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,709
starships just like the one on

113
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:50,719
vulnerable it a destroyed and nearly all

114
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:54,410
over Android devices next my colleague

115
00:08:50,720 --> 00:09:05,990
homie would demonstrate how to is causal

116
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:08,180
is a bug this one reality is able to

117
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,800
read all rot anywhere in the kernel

118
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,569
memory space when trying to root device

119
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,240
they as do several several problems

120
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:23,450
first it's real hard to produce this

121
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,630
problem indeed because time window for

122
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:30,980
tricking the malicious buffer free

123
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:36,890
operation is very narrow and second it

124
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:41,000
need efficient hip string function so we

125
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:56,390
are able to occupy the I inspired hit

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:59,600
buffer sorry ok as mentioned about in

127
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:03,199
order to trigger use our free problem we

128
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,959
should try to successfully is acute the

129
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,500
PC for buffer in such a narrow window

130
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,829
after the Panda alok new buffer is done

131
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,700
and before the code in line three one

132
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:19,370
nine five it is rich symbolic cutters

133
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,010
between this time window is shown on the

134
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,010
right side

135
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,350
it's really hard to run thousands on

136
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:32,470
lines or assemble Cooter's in such a

137
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:38,230
narrow window because it's well check

138
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:43,150
the user allow user free if it's true it

139
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:48,460
will return so the PC free buffer failed

140
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,180
and even in I pass this check Israel

141
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,890
called

142
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:57,189
bender a local free buffer leader demo

143
00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:04,420
checks here they are all backgrounds and

144
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:06,360
see some crash and reboot so how to is

145
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,740
ten time window

146
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:17,260
this occurs question I try with hi those

147
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:23,050
old methods such as we study on the CPU

148
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:30,060
frequency in fact the frequency around

149
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:30,060
po3 is no the same there - and the lava

150
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:39,390
so we try to unlocking the low

151
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,520
frequencies view while freeing in Haven

152
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:49,120
Suzanne is good father but not enough

153
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:53,130
then we study study on scheduler and the

154
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:02,830
windows his ants muses log it may affect

155
00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:08,840
their scheduler indeed it is

156
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:16,670
it's well call the week I'll cue with

157
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:20,060
analog event heavens what's more when

158
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:27,709
doing PC free buffer is called the new

159
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:31,430
test log so we can let the free process

160
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,370
with you for waiting to be wakened by by

161
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,219
the the server process right and the

162
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,010
client process right into a civics view

163
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,360
by keeping all the algae fuels busy

164
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:47,300
enough also coolest could call the

165
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,580
scheduler set affinity or for inference

166
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:56,719
as this works very well a nearly 100%

167
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:59,390
success rate it's not easy to trigger

168
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,930
this part indeed because it needs the

169
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,260
cooperation between the client process

170
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,930
and the solo process in this section I

171
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:18,140
will detail how to trigger the

172
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:20,620
vulnerability stabili in all to achieve

173
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,140
this we should think out how to

174
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:28,790
allocating and freeing job works first

175
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:34,160
as shown between line 3 7 8 and Serena

176
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:35,810
to head well traverse the red black tree

177
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:42,290
to find the best fit

178
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:44,930
when firmly free buffers first tray then

179
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,569
if the buffer size of the path of it 1

180
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,540
is not equal to the volunteer size it

181
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,540
will call Kizzy allowed to apply for new

182
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,630
one this one will be added to a free

183
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,860
powerful red black tree unaware be using

184
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:07,300
that time when applying for sacrifice

185
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:09,670
such precise plan the buffer object then

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:16,899
how to

187
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:20,079
freeing job works I'll show in 6:09 624

188
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,149
as well check if the powerful is the

189
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,540
least it's the last one

190
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:29,589
if not this next one will be pick it out

191
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:33,370
and check is an s3 is true an old and

192
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:36,579
the coke Aniki 3 is called in bandar

193
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,889
elated free buffer actually later if

194
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,430
they all check if that is a proven

195
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:45,190
before buffer you true Israel free the

196
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:48,279
base bath and keep the proven in

197
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,560
concluding the bunch of lava two cables

198
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:56,860
pan buffer object with a smaller

199
00:14:50,560 --> 00:15:00,939
powerful theta value so how to trigger

200
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:03,699
this vulnerabilities EE I think we have

201
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,779
the answer we teed up divided this into

202
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:08,170
two parts

203
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:11,769
step 1 continuously requests the server

204
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,860
process to produce most of the reply and

205
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:17,980
should avoid calling the destructor all

206
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,390
puzzle because the destructor or the

207
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:27,089
puzzle will send busy free buffer to the

208
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,089
kernel it's out of our control

209
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:40,930
step 2 school Long's days we feel free

210
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:45,310
this in reverse order we carried two

211
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:47,829
threads destroyed one hole singing busy

212
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,010
free buffer and destroyed to forcing in

213
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,079
PC transaction is showing a finger we

214
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:56,680
free the powerful in reverse order and

215
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:59,949
the kundo will unlock of free by the

216
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,079
ruler mission about when the PC free

217
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:06,120
path the command from the client process

218
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:10,388
and the PC reply command from the syrup

219
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,899
process happen at the same time the UF

220
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:19,060
problem could be triggered this is a

221
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:21,550
long window 14 sip hips bring to pass

222
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,920
such a process we can figure this one

223
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:32,430
ability

224
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:36,209
versus Emily a unit searching without

225
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:43,769
detail how to legally know symbols with

226
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:47,219
this vulnerability and you see the teeth

227
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:55,680
part aside off side we have mentioned

228
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:58,949
about is the leaks hold pawns we use the

229
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,430
mutex lock mechanism to extend the time

230
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:06,000
window and spree of the ceiling PC free

231
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,579
buffer to the kernel so when the server

232
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,230
process is the vehicle up again it

233
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:21,389
should it will set the tag node to the

234
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:24,569
tuner hunter and to ponderings three one

235
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,100
seven eight line so it's not good idea

236
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:31,830
to legal kernel symbol by the tag node

237
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:41,549
but the decides of cell size are

238
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:48,168
available and what about data the data

239
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:48,168
will be treated as a rotted or address

240
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,889
when called

241
00:17:50,200 --> 00:18:00,850
from Twitter the data will be rolling to

242
00:17:53,889 --> 00:18:04,449
eat so if we want truly info Canal

243
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:10,029
symbols from the cook honor we should to

244
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:12,940
satisfy these two conditions first one

245
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:16,330
by awesome the leek the kernel symbol

246
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,740
cannot info and also the data should be

247
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:24,129
the erotic goal address and no courage

248
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:34,210
of the being written this makes it more

249
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:36,639
difficult now so if there is a measured

250
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,450
pop has the checks of the T poverty that

251
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:46,600
are in copy from user this is definition

252
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:50,260
or of the copy from user it's mainly to

253
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:57,158
the check of change side and the child

254
00:18:50,260 --> 00:19:00,250
the function are copy from user its

255
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:04,899
happy to see the annotations skip all

256
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:10,419
tests we put aside 0 so go on let's

257
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:12,879
check the ash copy from user the ash

258
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,510
copy from user returns by it's not

259
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:22,659
copied so the copy from user will return

260
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:25,450
0 if we measure he are the size 0 it

261
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:27,580
will not go to the area branch but if we

262
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,610
said the key artists are 0

263
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,510
could we obtain a valid banned by for

264
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,510
object and more

265
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:46,039
let's check the code the on notation

266
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:50,539
pet zero size buffers so they can get

267
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:53,749
assigned unique address that's great we

268
00:19:50,539 --> 00:20:00,889
are still able to obtain a valid pen

269
00:19:53,749 --> 00:20:05,360
buffer object now we should sing out how

270
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:09,350
to make the TR t sub this r0 is very

271
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,620
easy in fact fundin fender native

272
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:16,189
service interface like this it is

273
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:25,189
returned directly as noted routing to

274
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:28,369
the reply now we do not need to care

275
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:32,480
about data and mode just try to leave Co

276
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:35,600
no symbol by the desires of says side so

277
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,559
how to find a valid info League strategy

278
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,539
from the vast amount of Cooter's work

279
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,539
hard for 24 hours every day

280
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:54,350
no you may try to solve the computer

281
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,080
problems in computer a we wrote a filter

282
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,480
in a Kimura lock and key free then we

283
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,350
may use all the fast words trigger all

284
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:07,279
cast all season calls then have a rest

285
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:13,850
with 4 hours all many days and the last

286
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:17,240
logs and a secrets like the one hip

287
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,889
string skills event of most important

288
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,869
parts when trying to explode with a user

289
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:26,769
freerunner ability the hips rearing

290
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,600
skills used for exploit in the wardrobe

291
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:34,970
vulnerability will be introduced in this

292
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:38,539
section thing about this it's very

293
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,690
time-consuming to fund available hips

294
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:45,639
restructure it should require no

295
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:49,519
permission and bypass checks most of all

296
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:52,549
could leak water we learned by hard

297
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:56,180
working with from it well steadily if

298
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:59,480
the love seeker but life cycle or each

299
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:06,980
it's out of control its main cause many

300
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:11,240
problems - an efficient method to turn

301
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:14,300
love cycle of each firm uncontrollable

302
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:18,380
into country people think about the

303
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:22,460
Kimura lock and Kezia log the Kezia log

304
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,770
is based on the FEMA log but it will

305
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,050
memo set the memory to zero

306
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:30,610
immediately after the memory is

307
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:34,760
allocated but the Kimura lock were not

308
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:38,449
which is object e an object B for

309
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:42,410
example the object it is released

310
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:48,100
released later is memory is called it is

311
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:53,270
occupied had he tied by the object B and

312
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:59,060
is a compliant for memory by calling Kim

313
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:02,840
allowed if the object B means life then

314
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:08,450
the given bad kernel as well being

315
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:12,800
better and if the lifecycle of object B

316
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:17,330
can be controlled the perverse did or

317
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:27,090
object e will believe and the red

318
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:31,710
residue or data will be tamed it works

319
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:36,179
like this first time the unexpected

320
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:42,840
release object released and we occupied

321
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:46,200
it and through the one he did there the

322
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,470
next time we occupied is to control his

323
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,730
love cycle this will be helpful

324
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,950
we employ him with a use our free

325
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,160
vulnerability we can use is to probe

326
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:02,610
tells the inspected afraid battle caused

327
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:05,400
by tricking this vulnerability we are

328
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:15,860
able to release it at a more appropriate

329
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:19,740
time here I will show example about this

330
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:22,830
we will call the F search our tree to

331
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,520
put the vaunted there there and then use

332
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:38,780
the stretch our notify even info to

333
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:41,030
cuddle love cycle and we

334
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,920
the emphasized child instead of the

335
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:48,379
search - because a small not abide

336
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:59,270
lightweight and well not a local and

337
00:24:48,380 --> 00:25:01,520
other sizes 128 slab object it can help

338
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:03,620
us write the 1 key to did her to the

339
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,240
unexpectedly the release buffer in

340
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:14,110
calling copy firm user

341
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,110
the value here is related we passed in

342
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:20,960
and the size of the strike our notify

343
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:27,110
event info can be said to a relay with

344
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:35,240
small value small value may be a little

345
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:39,949
bigger than 48 and we may Allah apply

346
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:46,910
memory by calling him a log so it could

347
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:49,940
be used to Karloff's eco life cycle you

348
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:54,380
can use offset Hartree to to cuss Ritu

349
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:00,980
or a trance the size to cut all three

350
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:12,350
more fat it's one I show example if we

351
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:14,890
say door so the user data now as well if

352
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:24,500
the only is well it could be your two

353
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:29,480
for Karla hips bring the color and the

354
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:33,490
flag in strength oh this one I would

355
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,910
love to show a plate-- spray for this

356
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:42,500
vulnerability we finds her hips reroute

357
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:48,100
her around the penetrable contest the

358
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,100
coder and the flags showing on left side

359
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:59,260
has a sim of set with the deed in

360
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:02,230
stronger pen buffer they are all 88 so

361
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:08,470
we can draw the PC transaction after PC

362
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:11,799
for buffering I'm out and it will do him

363
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:19,659
successfully immediatelly are the BCE

364
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:25,539
free buffer finished and we also use a

365
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:29,860
mirror spray because this decides 128

366
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:32,379
slab objects are frequently used for

367
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:37,479
example weaving calls free functions it

368
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:39,850
will allocate and are the two sides 128

369
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,720
slab objects before the tiger slab

370
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:51,879
object is allocated so how to deal with

371
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:54,159
this situation and we need to free pass

372
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:02,679
to sniffing :

373
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:05,350
it was veil in our test we have just

374
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:10,470
talked about how to spray it's time to

375
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:10,469
use this vulnerability to do a free ride

376
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:18,880
as mentioned above reply this the

377
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:23,470
obtains from server process but steadily

378
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,139
we cannot create a server or Andrew we

379
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,639
have an idea could we set the value to

380
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:33,189
the server and the cattle peg other

381
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:36,459
searching we found two the first one

382
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:41,230
will have earth control to pass its

383
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:46,730
meaning an arbitrary right whatever did

384
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:52,280
but to bias data second one

385
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:56,000
could control 16 pies every time that's

386
00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:00,520
enough for our exploitation and we will

387
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:08,270
use this interface later to exploit the

388
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:12,200
pieces we do every right but how do you

389
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:15,410
know if it's time to stop if we how do

390
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:21,050
we know we have rather success we put a

391
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:23,960
flag here when you screen and check each

392
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:27,190
time when we receive the reply even we

393
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:36,530
received the flag we have a food in

394
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:40,760
success routine and we have arbitrary

395
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:48,649
available ability now let's try to do

396
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:51,860
every raid in the mission about we use a

397
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:55,910
tag know the for up for it but it will

398
00:29:51,860 --> 00:30:01,520
be said to now ponder mean so process is

399
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:05,560
the Vicar so we try to cut hip 3 method

400
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,889
and called FZ Chaudhary with size 88 and

401
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:14,629
lose we have a chart we should we should

402
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:27,400
also in to adjust the CPUs and controls

403
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:30,950
free time okay now we are able to

404
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,400
arbitrary right arbitrary and leak the

405
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:38,510
key no symbols we all try to route the

406
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,760
devices in following searching I will

407
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:45,440
introduce how to route the piece of

408
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:49,610
yours in two measures the first one

409
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:54,790
correct the credit directly the second

410
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,790
one using the key as an MA attack

411
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:05,320
how to lick the correct address with

412
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:09,879
ease vulnerability is not easy to leak

413
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:20,919
the credit e readily and the human kind

414
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:27,520
absolute but who knows where to read we

415
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:32,200
try to leave the peace address address

416
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:40,540
or an object whose love seeker is

417
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:46,240
controllable saying we try to release it

418
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:51,129
and hope you occupy it immediately with

419
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:55,890
the targeted object later we could get

420
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,890
at Irish the value by arbitrary rain

421
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,180
here

422
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:08,300
introduce and easy to your papers ring

423
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:11,900
structure and continuing the credit the

424
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:16,850
F credit also the credential or the

425
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:21,740
process who is opening the file his well

426
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:28,250
call we open your divisors or file is

427
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:32,500
well called get any flavor and in the to

428
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:38,170
six to the eighth grade will be said to

429
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,170
the credit or credential or the process

430
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:52,150
the singer pichi pichi list will be

431
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:58,450
leaked to us by using this vulnerability

432
00:32:52,150 --> 00:33:10,700
because of said shown on dry side that

433
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:14,450
is six four and the sink PGP key list

434
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:20,450
point or a structural secret face object

435
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:23,420
whose side is 160 it's also frayed when

436
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:28,070
the strata singer P key object is

437
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:33,530
released the enemy occupied with

438
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:46,100
Australia file object recalled is 160

439
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:49,480
and the strife owl rifle is 250 56 so we

440
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,480
value the same side

441
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:02,490
then which will arbitrary right read

442
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,610
read to obtain the credential address

443
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:13,080
and it right ISM to zero to rule

444
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:20,909
directly this is an example by attending

445
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:23,639
of F credit who rule directly a newsie

446
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:31,950
searching are they all introduce how to

447
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:36,960
route by the key s an OE attack this man

448
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:45,918
is paralyzed by Jung Hwan that's the

449
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:50,070
year it's either a telescope or PTR to

450
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:53,549
obtain the privilege to write Colonel

451
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:58,020
Cooter's and then it still works on

452
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:01,980
Android device currently but it's new

453
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:06,930
true attack the Tramp a TDR on pillows

454
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:10,410
three because a container I made colonel

455
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:12,890
eight he yell zero has been said in the

456

457
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:26,460
avail unable to Colonel been running in

458
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:30,420
also space so reroute is we would it by

459
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:34,680
the following steps disable a ceiling

460
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:39,750
use enforcing set a you are the TRD yadi

461
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:46,200
and so on to zero and we said the curls

462
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:49,170
secure beats to zero this one is for by

463
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,930
this pipe by writing this one to zero we

464
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:56,870
are able to assess the problem with

465
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,870
their directories of F's

466

he rides the colors of the get addressed

467
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:17,210
jihadi and change the machine code to

468
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:26,960
the right side one to write the you are

469
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:31,940
djd yadi to zero and call this one to

470
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:39,050
draw them to try the security piece to

471
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:51,470
zero and we should set the cred

472
00:36:39,050 --> 00:37:02,980
Kevin be set to 3 F and a F and we

473
00:36:51,470 --> 00:37:02,980
routine ok now I will show you a video

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,469
[Music]

475
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:43,240
oh I'm sorry

476
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,240
it is cool not display here

477
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh

478
00:38:52,770 --> 00:39:27,000
oh this in the image ordering after the

479
00:39:15,290 --> 00:40:28,190
December 20 2008 he this one bypassed

480
00:39:27,000 --> 00:40:28,190
the key ASL waiting ladies

481
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:53,829
okay my back so it's a conclusion

482
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:58,558
secretary it's more and more difficult

483
00:40:53,829 --> 00:41:04,440
now to find universe rule Packers on

484
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:09,910
Android users but no system is safe and

485
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:13,839
we should find the caps wing ticking and

486
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:17,190
bugs be called the smile first

487
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:22,930
- very well now we shall find out

488
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:26,559
whether they can all do and difference

489
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:33,910
make a difference we should try a new

490
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:48,900
method and new techno tech niggas sing

491
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:56,040
heyo and so any questions yes please

car spray process right you are trying

495
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,710
