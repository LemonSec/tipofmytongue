1
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:25,340
hi everyone I'm journalist as I said and

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,850
I'm going to talk today about social

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,130
networks and whether we can fix it well

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,470
this is oh the clicker is not working

5
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,730
all right that's me so the first step

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,290
towards trying to you know find a

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,180
solution to a problem is to understand

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,220
it like how do we how do we get there

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,910
and what do I mean when I say social

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,220
media specifically so I'm gonna do a

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,349
quick recap of how we got there and then

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,250
let's see how that turned out

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,690
so it started of course with whoops oh

14
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,890
didn't go well

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,750
all right spoiler alert started of

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,400
course with the forums I mean that was

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,900
the first time that there was some kind

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,480
of interaction between people before

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,130
their before then there was the online

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,930
boards where people could post things

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,919
this in 1983 after that came of course

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,810
Yahoo to you you know your Maps which

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,850
was the first time that people started

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,950
to move away from being part of like

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,300
forum that you towards having your own

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,220
page that you could put it for example

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,869
if you were an IT person if you put

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,429
yourself in Silicon Valley and you know

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,620
that's how you would say this is the

30
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,580
this is me like what defines me like

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:37,430
interests that define me after that came

32
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,350
six degrees I'm not sure how many people

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,200
here know six degrees can you raise your

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:46,250
hand if you know six degrees oh cool so

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,930
one person yeah this one was probably

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,580
the most influential social network to

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,020
the current model that we have it was

38
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,170
the first one to have the concept of

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,240
adding friends for posting things and

40
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,530
having them comment on those having a

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,170
global search

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,000
unfortunately it died there was only

43
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,150
about 2% of the world on the internet at

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,160
that point so they were too soon five

45
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,069
million of five five millions five years

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,150
later came Friendster and times were

47
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:12,708
different they were already half a

48
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,230
million people on the internet and

49
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,290
thanks to the decreased stigma of online

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,738
dating they could catch more members and

51
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,129
they reach 1 million by 2002 so this

52
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:28,099
didn't go unnoticed there was Tom with

53
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,689
an online network of dating sites and

54
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,369
gaming sites and they took the

55
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:33,040
opportunity to build on our social

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,010
network and use their existing plat

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,459
forms to boost it so there can mine

58
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,730
space and then it wasn't for came

59
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,500
Facebook so it was originally intended

60
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,890
to be of course a student directory for

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,720
Harvard and well the first versions

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,879
lacked a lot of features but they had

63
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,650
some interesting things into it it was

64
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,879
the first time that you could see who

65
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,390
your mutual friends worked with other

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,459
people

67
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,649
so you could kind of hop along the

68
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,430
network and Leslie and see who was

69
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,010
around you then there was also oh that's

70
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,980
a bug I don't know what's going on there

71
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,659
was something else the clicker is not

72
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,310
working

73
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:18,220
oops something else would was the wall

74
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,989
so before then existing social platforms

75
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,780
had private messaging this wasn't such a

76
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,310
unique feature but Facebook didn't so

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,989
what they did instead was that they had

78
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,840
this world that all interaction had to

79
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,269
be performed in the world so it was the

80
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,620
first standard in social media what used

81
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:39,280
to be private interaction became public

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,870
this by the end of 2005 most of the u.s.

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,699
college campuses were already in

84
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,620
facebook you had to use a student

85
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:50,560
account to join it that that changed on

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,199
on 2006 where face would become public

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,319
and at that point the main rival to

88
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,319
Facebook was of course myspace but they

89
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,909
were doing things like this and also

90
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,458
doing some of this you know like filling

91
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,870
the website entirely with ads and also

92
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,459
they were not very focused in what they

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,519
wanted to be they were trying too many

94
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:13,440
things not enough focus so Facebook

95
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,639
exists the moment and by 2009 myspace

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,719
come turn into another completely

97
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:23,220
different company but well Facebook and

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,050
MySpace were bidding each other around

99
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,080
2006 there came another player into the

100
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,090
scene Twitter and at that point a lot of

101
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,800
companies already noticed Facebook and

102
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,929
MySpace and kind of like the model of

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,770
having friends and comments and

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,659
everything and they were trying to

105
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,520
replicate it but we didn't want to do

106
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,070
that we want to do something drastically

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,700
different very specific so short

108
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,849
messages on a stream like really fast

109
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,979
interaction between people

110
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,780
they also introduced something big in

111
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,510
what we know of social media today which

112
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,900
was the concept of following so this

113
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:02,230
turned out to be what complemented the

114
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,190
model into providing a metric to what

115
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:09,240
your social status on social networks is

116
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,889
in 2007 weights week introduced ads and

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,750
you might say well that's already

118
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,370
existed in MySpace and other social

119
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,620
networks but they introduced a specific

120
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,560
kind of ad which back then even Mark

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,639
Zuckerberg said it that it was a

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,500
completely new way of advertising online

123
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,660
it was the first time that they were

124
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,690
using personal data to target people

125
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,700
with advertisement and this was sooner

126
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,169
than Google sooner than Twitter they

127
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,120
were the first ones to do this no

128
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:38,740
mainstream platform here's just a

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,750
screenshot of like Google when they

130
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:46,150
started in 2009 with days two years

131
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:48,070
later so what this also triggered is

132
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,270
that okay so that was a way to make

133
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,760
money with social networks

134
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,330
so basically engagement equals more data

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,860
equals better targeting equals profit

136
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,940
basically engagement equals profit so

137
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,640
apart from this the last thing that

138
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,340
occurred in like to build a picture of

139
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,830
what social media is today was like back

140
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,570
then in 2009 there was no concept of

141
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,300
flags not nearing twitter and facebook

142
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,639
or myspace it was another company called

143
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,070
FriendFeed which they noted that there

144
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,960
were this explosion of social networks

145
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,280
that it was too hard to keep track of

146
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,930
everything that was going on so they

147
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,809
came up with a single unified timeline

148
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,300
where you could like the best post

149
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,039
across networks the Facebook had parted

150
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,229
on 2009 and that's how likes came to be

151
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,419
so this was a nine there's a public

152
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,400
interaction there's ads there's lights

153
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,770
there's followers there's timelines and

154
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,929
there is the notion of the well-known

155
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:48,219
notion like concept of engagement equals

156
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,990
profit so what happens is then well not

157
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,870
much King Instagram with photo filters

158
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:59,349
snapchat with stories fine with funny

159
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,520
five seconds videos and but overall this

160
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,128
the social model

161
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,590
remained the same and even further like

162
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,210
companies like Twitter that tried to

163
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,378
differentiate themselves back then by

164
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,539
building something completely different

165
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,580
or very specific I'm starting to look

166
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:15,039
more and more like like the existing

167
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,639
platforms like Facebook so why is that

168
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,520
well because makes a lot of money so

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,240
it's us in 19 when what happened with

170
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,818
that model of social networks well

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,050
public interaction turned into hate and

172
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,050
one of the most vulnerable in this case

173
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,759
it's teens so before if at school you

174
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,319
had there was one bully you know you

175
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,669
were vulnerable to this bully at the

176
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,960
school you know like chances are you

177
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,520
meet him in the hallway you might

178
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,810
believe well now with public

179
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,568
interactions being the default the

180
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,669
factor of social media you're vulnerable

181
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:49,599
to pretty much the entire world bullying

182
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:53,318
you well at the disruption of our

183
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,599
society to put it slightly with using

184
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,250
fake fake news you know spread

185
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:03,400
misinformation create polarization other

186
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,150
things there's a hear some funny fake

187
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,380
ads that feel pretty much practice it

188
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,060
and world likes validation and this is a

189
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,259
big problem once again with teens is

190
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,699
that you know when they're in that state

191
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,169
so you're looking for validation you're

192
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,740
trying to identify who are you in this

193
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,620
world well in likes being the measure if

194
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,190
you don't get enough validation well

195
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,460
this happens and followers became the de

196
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,930
facto social status across the world so

197
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,939
it's not relevant anymore like who you

198
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,700
are or you know how much of an expert

199
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,930
you are in certain topics followers have

200
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,760
become the de-facto metric to how

201
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,409
important your opinion is and this has

202
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,510
caused a lot of trouble because there's

203
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:45,579
a lot of people with the wrong opinions

204
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,890
using this abusing different platforms

205
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:52,199
to spread messages and time I became

206
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,420
polarization basically everyone gets a

207
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,709
individual view of the world and so when

208
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,839
you go out there and interact with other

209
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,640
people that have this completely

210
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,500
different view of the world and you

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,550
cannot understand like everything that I

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,520
see looks so different so you polarize

213
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,930
yeah you're gonna have conflict between

214
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:17,020
each other but something has gone right

215
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,750
and that is engagement equals profit no

216
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,980
metric this is two years back already

217
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,100
the stats I couldn't find the last one

218
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,840
but back then it was who aggregated

219
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:33,040
industry of six hundred billion dollars

220
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,480
so I think at this point and given the

221
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,099
last year and pretty much everything

222
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,620
that has happened we can agree that

223
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,470
recurrent social moral social media

224
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,970
model is broken and this is where I get

225
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,770
a question like the most obvious

226
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,410
question which is okay why don't social

227
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,360
media companies and break it well

228
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,250
because it's not broken for them the

229
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,170
reason they're making so much money and

230
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,230
they're doing great is because of these

231
00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,280
models nothing spreads engagement like

232
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,920
hate so if it's not going to be the

233
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,500
social media companies then who is it

234
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,310
well then it's up to us users to fix

235
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,720
social media and so that's where open

236
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:15,910
boot comes into play so we thought you

237
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,110
know at this point I hope you can

238
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,579
already see that the current model that

239
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,430
we have in social media was completely

240
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,170
arbitrary there wasn't master planner or

241
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,569
much analysis of how things could go

242
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,569
wrong or any history of things that have

243
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,230
gone wrong so if we give it another go

244
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,610
with the accumulated knowledge where

245
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,340
there is nothing to lose and much to

246
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,930
gain so that's what we did and we

247
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,480
started by okay let's eliminate the

248
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,459
concept of users entirely just change it

249
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,840
to people so we set up to do this based

250
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,490
on different principles so the

251
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,220
principles we set up to build new social

252
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,250
net was transparency the first one so

253
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,110
open book it all the source code is open

254
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,970
source like mobile app web app

255
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,600
everything and only that but also day to

256
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,520
day planning roadmaps feature requests

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,370
everything is open and apart from that

258
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,410
we're working in a dashboard to expose

259
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,540
all of our activities like all of the

260
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,050
sources of income all of the expenses

261
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,620
everything open the time there's lots of

262
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,150
privacy there's no tracking and we're

263
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,950
also making it easier to select the

264
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,030
audience that you can share content with

265
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,340
and only that by the end of the

266
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,720
year with an encrypting the post in your

267
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,200
timeline that you're sharing with these

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,990
specific circles like friends family or

269
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,310
work but from that there's a of course

270
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,640
you can have privacy if you don't have

271
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:41,300
the security foundation what we do is we

272
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:43,840
do a lot of test security test with

273
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,880
every feature that we shape we have

274
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:53,780
almost 90% coverage of the whole

275
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,520
codebase have metrics yeah and another

276
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,040
thing is that we're switching the focus

277
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,020
from people trying to build followers to

278
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,270
people trying to build communities so

279
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,130
for example we don't encourage we don't

280
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,890
show personal posts in the public

281
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:11,270
timelines we show community posts so we

282
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,890
try to to make it easy for people to

283
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,710
engage in a discussion rather than just

284
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:19,790
be a passive server on on social

285
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:21,560
platforms and only that with the service

286
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,270
community also like our Community

287
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,150
Guidelines and moderation and everything

288
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,100
is driven by the community it's or

289
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,220
guidelines were drafted by volunteers

290
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,350
from the platform there's also the

291
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,420
aspect of mental health well we made the

292
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,920
followers count

293
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,229
we made the followers count optional and

294
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,990
disable it for everyone will kind of

295
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,570
disabling it on the future entirely we

296
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,910
want to see how would it play and we've

297
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,710
gotten some good feedback that it's more

298
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,540
of our relaxing experience knowing that

299
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,140
somebody won't charge your profile based

300
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,660
on how many followers you have and then

301
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,650
for the more Asian aspect all of the

302
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,209
public timelines they they're all

303
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,040
community posts so it means that there's

304
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,370
an indirect layer of moderation with

305
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,810
everything that gets exposed into

306
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,670
everyone so there's no chance of

307
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,530
somebody posting something terrible and

308
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,670
right now appearing to millions of

309
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,490
people and the revenue model it's a

310
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,349
bessemer optional subscription that you

311
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,080
pay four years per month and you get

312
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:29,870
access to themes and animation animated

313
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:32,330
avatars and small things so and lastly

314
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,100
the sustainable growth like what has

315
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,060
buddy have seen so far with social media

316
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,620
I said

317
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,260
they go for high growth you know no

318
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,840
matter the consequences move what what

319
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,310
was it move fast break things so we're

320
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,710
trying to do the universe we're trying

321
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,550
to do slow growth and sustainable so

322
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:52,530
what we're doing is we're doing

323
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,810
invite-only forever so if we get some

324
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,939
challenges when we own Bor 10,000 people

325
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:00,300
we first fix them and then we continue

326
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,640
to import the next and what if this all

327
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,689
works well we're also committed to give

328
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,250
30% of everything of the profit for good

329
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,000
this is in partnership with a nonprofit

330
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,350
from the UK that it stores project of

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,360
climate change prevention and education

332
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:21,480
and sanitization so how does he look

333
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,240
like so far well we've been in alpha for

334
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,870
about two months we have 3,000 people

335
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,210
all of them paid to join the network we

336
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,580
have 1,500 communities ranging from

337
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:36,000
everything Game of Thrones to gardening

338
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,400
there's 25,000 posts there's 40 tons of

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,780
people on the list and everyone is

340
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:46,500
really happy and engaged on the platform

341
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:48,890
so how this did all happen well it's

342
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,820
entirely crowdfunded we did a

343
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,480
crowdfunding campaign we raised about

344
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:58,740
80k this is how it all was facilitated

345
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,280
so the question was well can we fix

346
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,170
social networks well I don't know that's

347
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,780
a really catchy title I'm probably what

348
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,120
you got you here but what I do know is

349
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,949
that it is her moral duty to try we're

350
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,430
seeing the negative impact that is

351
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,510
having on our society and especially us

352
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,790
here in this room which I imagine is

353
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,950
hackers engineers designers we know the

354
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,750
tools required to do something about

355
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,030
this yeah and at the end of the day

356
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:30,660
social networks are a reflection for

357
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:36,520
society so what kind of society do we

358
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:43,439
want to be thank you

359
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:49,300
