1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:25,760
so hello everyone so welcome to the arms

2
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,310
and this is my pleasure to standing here

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,939
you can see that he talked about the

4
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,129
stylized and the quinoa is a bird mass

5
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,440
so why do I call myself the bird emerge

6
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:41,150
that's very interesting because the

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,910
salad is a flying in the air so you can

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,580
seize an wa like a bird any so if

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,400
someone want to hike he'd want to

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,710
receive the data from the satellite see

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,760
what become the bird man so I call

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:01,160
myself the bird man

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:03,769
and at first I want to talk about me my

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,050
name is Ghajini I'm from 360 row

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,690
technology company which is a big is a

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,940
company in China so I'm a received

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,940
researcher of the Cerreta Research

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:19,580
Institute and a member of unicron team

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,740
maybe you you have heard about my team

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:29,000
my team is very strong in the IOT

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:32,119
research so I'm redoing our mental and

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,819
thus be slower my job is a result

23
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,979
research the security over the satellite

24
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:39,310
communications so I always needed to

25
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,229
receive singles from the satellites

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,759
lines of weather satellite and so on so

27
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,420
you can see they are always working

28
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,729
understand and the ticker at home

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,489
infamous that were cool isn't it

30
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:55,280
so if you want to receive the satellite

31
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:59,179
antenna is very important you need a

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,539
high Cantina and 2000 because a solid a

33
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:05,239
single is a very very weak and a need a

34
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,869
very good to by the way you need a lot

35
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,649
of knowledge to help you to to do that

36
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,470
computer knowledge and awareness

37
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,230
knowledge and electronic plans were

38
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,180
important a lot of people want to have

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,099
the science doesn't need or need a lie

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,790
so that's so funny

41
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,950
Salas is too complex and the silent

42
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,859
controlling is different from the day

43
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,489
think so if you want to have the salad

44
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,890
you need to send a single

45
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,550
to the air and here are some common

46
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,600
tools

47
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:45,040
oh my use useful so the software like

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:50,200
the GNU radio so the SDR pencil and SPR

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:55,480
shop and legs GQ is on the denounce the

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,640
hardware lies as pipe flow to SDR USRP

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,030
and blah blah blah so you know that they

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,029
have a lot who good SDRs in the world

53
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:09,220
and if you want to receive singles you

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:13,240
can use a spy sends a very good SDR for

55
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,390
the receiver and if you say need to send

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:21,060
a single the Uni the proto SDR or USRP I

57
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:24,670
like the proto SDR very much so thanks a

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,890
sense to the Adi company to give us a

59
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,890
very cheaper SDR to study and research

60
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:38,980
so salad have a different Albert around

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:43,990
the earth lands yo Jimmy o GE o

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,890
so across the house another of us like

63
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,900
the GTO RGS Oh SSO

64
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,850
so certain tell you to I owe you solace

65
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:57,520
is money any other salad so but usual as

66
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,280
is flying very fast almost seven

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,940
kilometres west second so look on the

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:08,920
future so L use a lot a very faster than

69
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:14,670
gia saralidze so does not know not easy

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:18,579
to capture the arrow salad so we need a

71
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:22,960
precise clock to help me to capture like

72
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:26,200
the GPS time service and auto tracking

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,590
and hina the TfL can be downloaded by

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,860
the ared that's a very interesting

75
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:35,560
organization so and the TOA data can be

76
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,640
used to for tracking the salad by the

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,930
Mojo of STP for as TV for or as gv8 as

78
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,320
DP 8 so the STP mode as a TV for module

79
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,150
or

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,200
is working for the last two thousands of

81
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,760
225 mean means meanings other times so

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,610
if you want to learn more about this

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:04,180
Union to create and by yourself so have

84
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:07,000
a lot of knowledge about this so how to

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:11,620
curve how to catch the aerial or burst

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,100
allies so you sell as often flying very

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,900
fast

88
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,360
and you if you want to receive the data

89
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,270
from the from them you need a good

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,080
antenna and you are antenna in the auto

91
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,719
tracking to the stylus so I build your

92
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,990
auto tracking system name the opening

93
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,090
here is that's very that's very cool

94
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,670
over here eight years ago me to judge

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,619
hacking the flying inside eyes across

96
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,840
you if you want to build in your jaw

97
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,780
consider me you can download eight the

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,989
open edges from the github that I open

99
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,809
service project and you can replace and

100
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,070
he not work all that well become ultra

101
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,700
farces term just a joke

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:58,659
don't tell anyone I said that okay so my

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:03,490
auntie no gain on the air band is a 15-4

104
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:07,420
16db I and the Anika is a 15 DB and a

105
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:12,730
nose factor is the point of 7 DB and my

106
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:17,560
antenna diameter is 0.9 meter so that's

107
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:20,050
what we're good la see the future

108
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,330
computers in the single to the open 80s

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:29,920
and open eight years of the controllers

110
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:32,340
and he not upon us a light so look at

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,340
that video

112
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,780
you can see my artichokia and Hina and

113
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:58,889
just gives him into ankles like a C and

114
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,219
the e L he were pointed Haggard you can

115
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:06,389
use it to talk in the salad or any other

116
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:09,030
flying device but you need the beauties

117
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:11,820
by yourself I use a ship and he not to

118
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,809
do them so open it here to run you on

119
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:22,890
the other board to control the stepper

120
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:26,190
motor so someday when I was using my

121
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:33,719
opening he has to such salad I found

122
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:37,080
something on euro I found some and a lot

123
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,350
of single from the all my special

124
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,280
software and this thing always the

125
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,310
Doppler shift

126
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,340
we are decoded I kind her something

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,410
somewhere is talking so the single

128
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,919
center frequency the fifteen forty four

129
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,370
point five so wow that's very

130
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,700
unbelievable so people are always

131
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,490
talking on the UHF or VHF band so

132
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,950
Interphone working on this band to so

133
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:10,710
bad it's easy the Arab and so what Hayes

134
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,380
in our band and always using for the

135
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,450
airplane and the salad communications

136
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,729
and sends very important band for

137
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:21,030
example mobile communication where those

138
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,640
allies allergy SS system and the single

139
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,969
with Doppler shift unit and the Doppler

140
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,690
shift

141
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:30,510
blue shift or red shift so I think is

142
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:33,510
from the movie device so I need found

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:38,099
out where is a single from and a Google

144
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:41,789
I found this very interesting and I

145
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,510
found out the system name the cosmos

146
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:49,530
Assad and the system systems darling I

147
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,240
was in the frequency in 1544 point five

148
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:55,500
megahertz and the thing of the world

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,660
from the 18 satellites anyway whether

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,030
cell has made by Americans as very

151
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,500
important well solids in the world and

152
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,370
many conch many countries together

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:11,080
whether information but anyway salads

154
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:15,670
like a 15 18 19 20 so anyway 20 have

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,160
another name GPS as a while so crl you

156
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:22,209
over salads you can see that a lot of

157
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,390
children from period from the annualized

158
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:28,870
somebody maybe try to receive them like

159
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,670
the AP future or HIV future look has

160
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,670
this video from the EOS allies

161
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:57,360
you can cylinder single from the AOA

162
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:17,910
silent darling how was in her frequency

163
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:20,720
on the 15 44.5 Magatha the single is

164
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,719
mild more stronger

165
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:27,130
so you can see that a lot of analog

166
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:30,600
singles from the US allies okay so you

167
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:35,589
can curse them somewhere is it talking

168
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,620
so what is a COS process at and why the

169
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:42,570
weather Sarah Hauer was single and I

170
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,570
don't understand so let's go

171
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:54,190
so cos cos Assad is a search and rescue

172
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,560
satellite-aided tracking system so as

173
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:02,170
the first Alice cause of Hathaway launch

174
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,239
hitter in 1982 and the four original so

175
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:20,170
four original member nations the ADA so

176
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:22,270
when you a us candor and friends so this

177
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,719
is the principle of the COS process our

178
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,880
system we considered the emergency

179
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,930
meetings the number one emergency

180
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:35,050
meetings in the single to the salon used

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:37,300
phone for their six megahertz and the

182
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,959
number two is a search and rescues

183
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,040
allies and the number two the solid

184
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,199
receives a single and we replayed to the

185
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,480
numbers raise a local user to me know

186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,200
local user terminal is lut ground

187
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:59,680
station so user darling is a fifteen

188
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:05,470
fourteen four to eight a 1844 truth in

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,719
eighteen forty four point five so so

190
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,639
number three the local user terminal

191
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,800
grass trees in decode the message it was

192
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:14,980
a number four missing control center and

193
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,189
the number four receives a message and

194
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:28,170
the latest number of our rescue team and

195
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:31,510
to give health so this you can see this

196
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:36,040
this system is a rescue since terms as

197
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:38,850
well cool because the system is very

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,680
important it was even people's life and

199
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,860
who had the emergency beacon in the

200
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,680
house three different terminals one is

201
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:52,570
IOT for the airplane and helicopter so

202
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,810
what is period he for some people or

203
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:02,230
some team so an otherwise is an EPIRB

204
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:04,869
for the ship they have a GPS module in

205
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:08,490
the begins so the message will see the

206
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,170
GPS position to the MACD control center

207
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,510
so the answer is very important and

208
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,949
first they have no GPS module in the

209
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:20,170
world begins in the in the order begins

210
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:22,449
but we can calculation where the where

211
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,610
is a single from because we can know

212
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:28,149
then the silence tradition and the

213
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:30,940
Doppler shift of the single say we can

214
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:38,790
conclusion the sizing angle of the

215
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:41,230
beginning so this is her maja 94

216
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:44,139
local you the terminal stations and

217
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,510
mothers that he's 34 missing control

218
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,370
centers in the world you can see the

219
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,490
tracking antenna in the air you tease

220
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:54,339
sedition and he now receives a single

221
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,040
from area or over the satellites

222
00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:00,069
and a lot of MCC control center in the

223
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,170
world or one on the society because we

224
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:05,589
needed to receive the message from the

225
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,899
see if you have if we have more and more

226
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,850
stations we were not missing and in

227
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,709
peeking

228
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,420
so how a big antenna for the geo

229
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:19,079
satellites to more bigger and another

230
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,529
ninja tracking because the geo salad is

231
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:26,920
not moving from us and the average here

232
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:29,709
at his station is very important in the

233
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,889
thermo we needed him to receive singles

234
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,839
and decode the message to to the salad

235
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:37,170
see how more honestly she is building

236
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:37,170
now

237
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:43,360
so the causes are the pillows are always

238
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,759
working on the weather satellites like

239
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,180
the meat hope see you a phone meeting

240
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,709
salads this Peter did not easy to take

241
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:56,258
it because the pillow they don't worry

242
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,479
infancy we and need you know good

243
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:01,420
antenna and the more power the power

244
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,579
mother salad is very wearable so this

245
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,248
people are always walking all the big

246
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:09,128
satellites like the weather salad like

247
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:11,529
communication salads so we need a lot

248
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:19,870
who started to cover the world world

249
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:22,499
it's very difficult and it is t this is

250
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:27,939
Herman supermodel

251
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:31,809
41,000 rescues more than 35,000 lives

252
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:34,569
and have been saved in the world and his

253
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:37,449
service have a wide range of application

254
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:40,479
in the world so this is a great system

255
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,990
if you can't connect your friend or now

256
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,990
our

257
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,839
you can use this system all in the

258
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,999
beginning has you to your life so if you

259
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:54,129
want to go ask our thoughts maybe you

260
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:55,540
need to take one he'll be for you so

261
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,079
look at this video

262
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,670
this video is from the NOAA to have

263
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,670
something wrong it's a ship

264
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:30,030
now the ascent message to the SAS I'll

265
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:34,170
begin by the Sahaba understand the

266
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:38,300
message was a solid allies and windows

267
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,300
and where we are where we are

268
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,110
okay

269
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,660
so what is the contact of the disgrace

270
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,899
distress single so let's go into an

271
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,900
elastic serum and the phantom all

272
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,280
instancing about the serum and the

273
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,320
number one found the protocol of the

274
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,410
analysis term from the official

275
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,810
documents in the official documents I

276
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,810
found the spectrum of the peaking single

277
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:41,450
and the format of the message the

278
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:46,550
message have two different formats short

279
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:48,770
message and the message so how how

280
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,980
country code in the message to sense why

281
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:56,840
we can know then where is which country

282
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:59,360
the ship or apply from and so how GPS

283
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:05,929
state in the thirteen seven to eighteen

284
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:08,629
five piece and as a message how beseech

285
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:14,420
coded to make sure the message is right

286
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:21,410
so BCH code is an error correction error

287
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:25,760
correction coding so gets the

288
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:28,940
information from all the system we can

289
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,360
season system modulation is single

290
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:37,940
modulation is BPSK and symbol read is

291
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:42,979
400 PBS and the battle was is 18 kilo

292
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:48,200
Hertz and the uplink power is a 35 to 39

293
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:51,340
t BM likes 3 watt 3 to 8 watt so the

294
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,390
uplink frequency is four zero six

295
00:19:51,340 --> 00:20:01,669
megahertz and so on and the darling

296
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:07,090
frequency likes 15 44.5 lands in a gos

297
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:11,290
gps meet hope and the 1541 Emma said and

298
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:15,139
1544 on a wire like the Galileo and the

299
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:20,639
15 44.9 Amiga kilometer to colonna's and

300
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:25,560
on the s-pen the GPS 3 and dsss alight

301
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:29,820
and sleep and insects allies so look at

302
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:33,240
the top of the picture so a single issue

303
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:38,939
buzzer for 4006 nigga has an Tina I'm

304
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,670
free I'm I'm fry but I any input you and

305
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,310
go to the town called her and it's in

306
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:47,520
the alley so I always single out food

307
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:49,260
and go to the Concord I've called her

308
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,230
and the true the elbe and through the

309
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,710
articles of power unfair and the next

310
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,120
scene out by the urban and Tina we can

311
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,810
oh there is a pillow that don't do

312
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,669
anything so just up call her the singles

313
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:11,730
it was all bad so since we're

314
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:14,780
interesting evidence appeared on how to

315
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:19,250
different channel one is SAR and

316
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:22,440
otherwise SAR P so the SERR is just

317
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,870
repelled her the analog repaired the

318
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,750
analog analog single and in the fairness

319
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,000
be received the parties Chino so as I

320
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,240
have here can decode the message and the

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,650
sinner to the LED beauty stitching but

322
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:44,640
as a RP pillow the Jessica ended 20

323
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:48,030
2,400 2,400 rupees one peers peers one

324
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,260
second so the beginning is a single the

325
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,800
trust me to buy the

326
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,710
rambled remedies and as a ser is a do

327
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:59,520
nothing for the single just a rescue

328
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,880
rescue repeater so the single from the

329
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,860
Interphone P from the Interphone PVC

330
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,930
with the visor as they are payload and

331
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,750
it's a up covered her to the elbe and

332
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,360
donning that's why I came here somewhere

333
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:17,550
is talking in the air abandoned sense

334
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:22,800
from the ser pedal donning and you can

335
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:26,129
see senator Inouye a stunning frequency

336
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,730
and the spectrum and from the Emma said

337
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:33,030
f3 satellite and on the right you can

338
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,520
see the big became is my her bird so

339
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:43,340
it's too small

340
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:46,400
i decode the message by the EPIRB

341
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,610
brother and the mmunity psg software

342
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,200
across you can look about another way to

343
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:57,709
language in your video or MATLAB so I

344
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,470
decoded from the Emma said I've realized

345
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,980
and a new kind is a message when she is

346
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,570
from the UK and another another way in

347
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,200
the from the friends they are in

348
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:11,419
dangerous and they need help if you want

349
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,790
to receive and it equals a message you

350
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:22,160
need Valentina I'm fried her same inputs

351
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:24,320
and to SD our lives a spy see Sansa can

352
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,780
use the software because as a our

353
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:32,809
message by the way you need to find out

354
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:35,178
where is a solid solo look at this video

355
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:39,678
I using my antenna receives a single

356
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:43,840
from the AOA 1980 and used moon TPS case

357
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,840
of vertical decode the message

358
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,030
you

359
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,740
we can send down a lot of old and I love

360
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,080
the singles from the darling and it's a

361
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:48,340
beginning single day like it's very

362
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,908
small at her bird okay so wait he called

363
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:57,330
it's a sheep is from the gym huh and

364
00:24:50,909 --> 00:25:02,470
it's in dangerous need help in the sea

365
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:05,110
so this is the other satellites see how

366
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,629
weather satellites never gives Alice and

367
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,168
the communication satellites so like G

368
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:12,070
yes

369
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:16,899
GPS Galileo Cronus and the for me and

370
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:22,570
Emma said instead a little L and a meet

371
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:27,459
hope no pulse and a beetle DSS and and

372
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:34,119
so also still have most modern - meaning

373
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:36,850
users in the world and most and 3613

374
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:40,629
serving salads all right now and the

375
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:44,678
most 94 lut local user terminal stations

376
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:47,529
and the most acid is 34 I'm seasick

377
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:53,429
interest in hers so there's a very big

378
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:56,700
sister so let's do a little penalties

379
00:25:53,429 --> 00:26:00,340
okay I building a project for the hist

380
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:02,860
so a building a software named the

381
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,529
hacksaw and to do some interesting

382
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,600
scenes a high son sends a message to the

383
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:10,419
G in your video energy new radio

384
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,199
modulation this message anissina to the

385
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:14,139
SDR

386
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,019
saying the SDR seen a single to the air

387
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:19,360
and the receiver side I used the earth

388
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:22,629
band who receives a single and decoded

389
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,240
by minute EPS key so the soft work has

390
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:28,509
seen the Tesla message or a lot of

391
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:33,340
message to the two attackers as a system

392
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:36,340
across across you can communication by

393
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,759
solid tool so it's very dangerous in

394
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:42,908
exactly the GNU radio project in not the

395
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:45,609
real project I'm sorry I can't open the

396
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:48,429
service also and gene you redo project

397
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:49,809
so I don't want anyone using to

398
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:57,190
intelligence analysis

399
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:59,469
so that's well not funny Luke has this

400
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:08,529
video I used my soul to send a lot ho

401
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:18,820
first message I use the proto STR - -

402
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:20,799
zan and it receives a single bad spy so

403
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,499
you can see that the software sings in

404
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:29,080
the DDoS mode and seen through the SDR

405
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:29,679
and I use immunity PS k to decode the

406
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,918
message

407
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,969
a lot of false message in the software

408
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,969
will become

409
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:09,390
so all these are false message just the

410
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:12,929
dhih dhih dhih does the system okay so

411
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:16,080
if someone's in the fix rescue message

412
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:18,510
to the satellite and the MCC control

413
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,480
center will be received a false message

414
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:27,120
to things that let the rescued him to

415
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,800
keep help okay so don't worry about this

416
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,979
I tried that history in the legal

417
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,740
frequency so dick has searched the

418
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,780
message by them they detained her but we

419
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,460
can receive the message from the Select

420
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:44,730
awning and we can we have used using a

421
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,610
message and the server of the attack so

422
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:54,480
they can make sure which one is real and

423
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:56,729
which one is false method and how to

424
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,920
build trust me to assist her mother

425
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,160
receives a term the number one you need

426
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:04,650
a PC to build a message and thing you

427
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,970
need as the art was in the the single

428
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:15,000
likes a number two and number three use

429
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:19,350
a UHF band unfair and and output a

430
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,870
single to the antenna and the receivers

431
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,530
a union antenna working on the air band

432
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:30,060
and connected to the Elbe and a a and

433
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:35,240
saying inputted receive SDR Liza air spy

434
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,240
and go to the PC to decode the message

435
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:51,890
so so what

436
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:54,710
don't be hung if somewhere attack if

437
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:57,110
someone if some hackers in a lot who was

438
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,630
messy - through the satellite he will

439
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:01,969
attack all the system in the world

440
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,040
because always a message and city

441
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,890
controls in hers are interconnected

442
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:10,120
for example if some some sheep from the

443
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:13,130
America in the dangerous in China and

444
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,800
the danger is easy controls in her in

445
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:18,580
America we know that the member country

446
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,370
will help each other in the world

447
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,490
the question is MCC seen her can't make

448
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:28,850
sure coming Sudan which one is a true

449
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,920
and which one is false so they were they

450
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,370
were not care about the people who need

451
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:37,670
a real help and the time is life if you

452
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:39,939
you are in dangerous so that's where it

453
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,940
in reverse

454
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:47,030
Luke Hardy is Peter if someone's in

455
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,199
message by the Salida for example a

456
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:54,740
scene message is the number eight Aysen

457
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,570
and message to the number B that's very

458
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:03,100
interesting look at this machine maybe

459
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:06,620
maybe this is in for how us by mode

460
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,899
another mode it is by mode and one more

461
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,419
in the interval mode so maybe imputed

462
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:14,720
the order and say we will be influenced

463
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,940
by mode so when you improve this bimodal

464
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,520
that the information can send the

465
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:23,420
message to the salad and the decode to

466
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:28,240
that another way the ticket was a and

467
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,240
the other side in other countries oh

468
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:39,820
okay to have some something wrong with

469
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:43,669
you can see the energy this is all the

470
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:46,639
16 servings allies in the air so two

471
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:50,110
months salad to make sure not not

472
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,110
amazing every beacon

473
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:03,679
the right

474
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,590
is a coverage area of the Elio and gos

475
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:17,480
allies you can see that geo salon have a

476
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:24,730
wide range of error so to the point

477
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:32,030
Oh ABCDE so anyway 18 is a user and

478
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:34,480
electrode who is Solana is GU salad if I

479
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:38,510
send a message to the electrode who

480
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:43,130
along to out who selected the secret

481
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:46,520
reason to so if if the piece in the

482
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:52,910
message to the AOA 18 salad and the e

483
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:56,210
will be received and if the piece in the

484
00:32:52,910 --> 00:33:03,610
message hello to the salad and the D

485
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:03,610
will be in resilient and in Australia so

486
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:10,820
you can use yourself modulation and

487
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:16,660
encryption nobody knows and what he was

488
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,659
saying so maybe it's file already using

489
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,100
okay if someone send a lot who think

490
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:27,889
message and the gentle will be too bad

491
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,100
the mcc control center will get a lot of

492
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,400
false message and the condom to an

493
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:37,310
assumed and then movement across if the

494
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:40,940
hackers in a long time you will find out

495
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:43,700
where is a hacker don't do that - hey

496
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:47,710
girl also also containing the salad

497
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:51,170
links and dense hikers Furies maybe

498
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,200
maybe it's yours but please don't do

499
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,200
that

500
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:02,030
so the subtle appeal of the ADA wary

501
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:05,420
since he since he since insist he was so

502
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:08,750
but much o in phones how high traffic

503
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,290
meet her transmit power I did a simple

504
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:13,050
calculation so anyways are as the fries

505
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,810
to be

506
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:22,590
Schloss answer 4:06 Makaha will moses

507
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:25,110
143 DB but in inner comes transmitted

508
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:29,370
power is too high easy to interfere

509
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:31,470
so select by the blocking blocking so in

510
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,750
fairness so the silent no we are not

511
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,839
normal to receive the real begins a

512
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:42,770
design moment so and if someone's into a

513
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:50,280
single mother she never seen a single

514
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:52,800
modem used 16 1617 DBM saying will be

515
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,780
received by the salad to exactly this is

516
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,660
the menu

517
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:04,800
meanwhile so the salad appear either

518
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:09,930
easy to be interfere in the worldwide so

519
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,030
so have some questions some problem the

520
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,009
number one is anyone care assumes that

521
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:17,130
he called the message through the elbe

522
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:19,560
an antenna and the salad a pillow the

523
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,200
ADA to sensitivity very easy to

524
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,049
interfere and the DDoS attacks so

525
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,960
everyone can send the first message to

526
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,380
the satellite and the sullen in southern

527
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,350
link cab is stolen

528
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:37,050
so I found a lot who interfere in the

529
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,480
salon Tony sense very unbelievable we

530
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:44,730
don't know about this before loop hands

531
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:47,130
is my friend helped me to recall some

532
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,600
singles from the Australia and the

533
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:54,150
England we consider the same problem

534
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:56,970
also this also in these countries

535
00:35:54,150 --> 00:36:00,330
I think the sim aged for in the world

536
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:03,779
world so maybe they didn't know that

537
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:07,400
they are in the ferry interference in

538
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:10,770
system and he sings a single and as a

539
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:15,500
four zero six megahertz maybe they never

540
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,500
heard about the COS process as his term

541
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:29,809
but it is only early god who trusts me

542
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:32,849
information and for the six megahertz so

543
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:35,519
that's where important the most most

544
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:40,710
uniform can be seen at a receive and

545
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:43,589
for four to four hundred and four 470

546
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,930
megahertz and why so many interference

547
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:50,660
can be found in the dawning of the

548
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:53,999
satellite math and math and that's very

549
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:57,239
important if you are a harm you will

550
00:36:53,999 --> 00:37:00,180
know that a lot who were uniform in in

551
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:04,259
the phone can be working on the four

552
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:07,828
hundred and the 417 megahertz for

553
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:10,229
increasing so that's very important

554
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:12,779
because a lot of people don't know don't

555
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:16,259
know that idea interferes in system

556
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:18,779
so if you add have to seat her maybe you

557
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:22,920
are keaney some people saying you will

558
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:25,529
become modeler and please don't do

559
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,890
please do not interfere this is a term

560
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:31,049
we need is sis Herrmann to see you more

561
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:35,029
and more people they are seeing our

562
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:37,890
lives so maybe somewhere you will need

563
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:42,019
you will needed needed to receive your

564
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,019
life and I don't do that please

565
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:50,549
okay so thank you thank you my friend

566
00:37:46,380 --> 00:38:02,609
from you young glad and the Sun from the

567
00:37:50,549 --> 00:38:04,200
Australia so any questions yes thank you

568
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:07,308
how do you mean stay for your

569
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,308
presentation are there any questions

570
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:20,569
yes so how wide was the band that is

571
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:33,269
being of comforted by these satellites

572
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:34,650
like eighteen 880 18 kilo Hertz so so so

573
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,740
Allah is very

574
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,900
a bigger wider wider range so you you

575
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,950
can you you can use it to send your

576
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:50,670
message or a wise or was to talk each

577
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:52,759
other by the satellite okay any other

578
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,760
questions

579
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:59,670
is there any initiative to add device

580
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,390
authentication or some sort of

581
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:06,360
cryptographic signatures to allow device

582
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:09,900
manufacturers to assign the messages

583
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,500
that they're sending I'm Florida I don't

584
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:16,680
know what humi kind of thing okay

585
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,330
so the denial of service attack problem

586
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,750
comes that there's no authentication on

587
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,640
the messages that that you can generate

588
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,620
just the bitstream and send it and they

589
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,120
don't know if it came from an authentic

590
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:32,370
ELT or some device that you've

591
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,430
manufactured do you know if there's any

592
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:39,390
movement or any initiative inside the

593
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:44,730
industry to try to add an authentication

594
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:47,220
layer to the messages yeah but if you

595
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:52,970
send your message by yourself and with

596
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:55,500
your modulation and encryption we so

597
00:39:52,970 --> 00:40:02,490
anyway I can't know that well what do

598
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:04,620
you think right so that works in the

599
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,509
case where you're flooding it with other

600
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:11,790
messages but in terms of the sending

601
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:14,190
fake distress messages that I'm sorry I

602
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:16,130
know what he'll say I don't know what

603
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:20,060
you mean

604
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:24,330
so are there any other questions yeah

605
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:28,230
Mike in the case of spies using the

606
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:30,029
system I'm over here by the way it's

607
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,700
possible for you to see the beacons that

608
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,560
are being transmitted by the spies it's

609
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,299
just that presumably the message won't

610
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,460
be interpreted as a proper distress

611
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,110
beacon because it's containing some

612
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,000
other information that they want to send

613
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:44,430
to somebody else would you be able to

614
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,210
locate the person sending a message like

615
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:53,098
that through this system yeah so the

616
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:57,810
sorry my english not a goddess or i

617
00:40:53,099 --> 00:41:00,060
don't know what you mean so you know you

618
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:04,200
gave the example of spies using the

619
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,910
system to send messages yeah everyone

620
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,970
who has access to this system can see

621
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,180
all the messages sent via right yeah so

622
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:14,069
if a spy tried to do that would they be

623
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,049
able to disguise it like a legitimate

624
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,730
beacon or would it be obvious that they

625
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,440
were using it to send information that

626
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,950
wasn't supposed to be sent via the

627
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,560
system

628
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:28,980
no just biasing is seen as a messy

629
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,619
facade sorry you can use the SERR

630
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:35,160
payload and I say our payload and not

631
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:39,170
not care what he's a message and what

632
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:43,520
he's a single so today our channel just

633
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:49,560
repaired her to the replay to the single

634
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:53,759
to the abandoning so you feel seeing a

635
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:56,369
message by your modulation and using any

636
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:04,020
angles so so solid don't do anything

637
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:08,150
just briefly single to the tonic so so

638
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:10,740
you can seen any animation not only the

639
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,030
beginning mmm-hmm I'm going to be

640
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,040
feasible for the owners of the

641
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,760
satellites to locate people that were

642
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:24,470
using the satellites in this way yeah

643
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:24,470
okay okay so anybody has a question to

644
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:31,369
know then I want to thank him very much

645
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,369
first talk

646
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:34,980
thank you

647
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,980
you
