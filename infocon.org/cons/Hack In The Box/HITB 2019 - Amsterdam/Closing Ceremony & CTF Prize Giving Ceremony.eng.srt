you would have noticed a crazy big track

64
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,470
in the hacks po area which was this

65
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,269
amazing AI self racing challenge did any

66
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,520
of you try it it wasn't just people

67
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:46,570
using remote controls to drive cars it

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:49,300
was AI so let's bring up Jonathan see on

69
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,680
stage to do the prize-giving Jonathan

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:04:07,600
are you around yeah there you go

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:04:09,130
round of applause for Jonathan guys hi I

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,850
just come in this home sorry

73
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,350
so who has played a haka do you anybody

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:19,600
hi hi thinks so I'm so happy to organize

75
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,350
this race for these two days and

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,500
actually we won a I versus human race

77
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,270
today and we have trained like AI car to

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,360
race against

79
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,479
human so the rules is I think it's a bit

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,090
interesting as I the first movies the

81
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,400
human car cannot crash into the AI car

82
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,090
because the AI cannot respond to a crash

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,580
okay so and the AI car staffers still we

84
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,859
have some humans we who is really good

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,690
drivers who can like finish the lap in

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,780
six second with image I can never do

87
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,440
that and right now I think we have a

88
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:00,460
price for our best a I driver right so I

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,870
mean the best AI trainer so actually the

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,799
best AI team is from TomTom

91
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,050
unfortunately they have to catch the

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,530
playing and and we have our first

93
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:19,780
runner-up who is Adam so we have a price

94
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:22,239
for Adam right okay so the price is

95
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,508
actually a Jason nano developer bought

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,030
which is released by Nvidia not long ago

97
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:31,270
so we want to present this price to Adam

98
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,698
so hopefully he can continue like okay

99
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,270
so he can continue working on the donkey

100
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,580

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,870
females in this competition either here

167
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,780
or in Middle East where I live or even

168
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,180
in Europe in u.s. the number of females

169
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,329
are very limited so I talk to Dylan

170
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,430
let's run a woman in cybersecurity CTF

171
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:18,990
to bring more females to a cybersecurity

172
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,329
game so the competition today was in

173
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,640
sponsored by Trend Micro and the winners

174
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,940
will travel to Tokyo by the end of this

175
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,850
year to compete in Trend Micro

176
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:34,070
competition CTF in Japan in Tokyo

177
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:38,150
so the winner for this competition today

178
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:58,489
team hack sauce please come to the state

179
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:58,489
[Applause]

180
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,849
so then you pass in a chicken

181
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,460
[Applause]

182
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:33,869
[Applause]

183
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,660
and now for the much awaited price

184
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:48,509
giving our signature capture the flag

185
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,660
competition that has been running in

186
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:55,860
hacking the box all these years it's

187
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,850
been a very very difficult capture the

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,269
flag is what I've heard

189
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,670
one of the hardest I don't know if the

190
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:06,540
participants agree well probably not the

191
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:09,029
winners but the scope and persik from

192
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,910
the hack in the box and LCD F team plays

193
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:17,880
for the prize-giving

194
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:17,880
[Applause]

195
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:26,129
all right so we've already had a few

196
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:28,379
people talking about Cydia so I don't

197
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,170
think I have to explain much about CD

198
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,879
f's nice thing is that this is a 10th

199
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,769
year anniversary of hacking a box and

200
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,439
also of our C Jeff we were there when it

201
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:42,350
started we will be there for as long as

202
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:45,529
this goes on we have a few statistics

203
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,529
[Music]

204
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:58,139
numbers so let's start with dreams when

205
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:01,740
we started way way way back way back in

206
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,629
2010 there was a small area and you're

207
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,949
free to come you were free to go you

208
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:11,879
could join if you like no problem these

209
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:13,618
years we have a very set mudroom which

210
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,199
means we can only have a few teams and

211
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:20,990
this team this year there was a maximum

212
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:25,069
of 27 teams which means we had 27 teams

213
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:28,079
these teams were divided on let's see

214
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:31,949
seven countries with slightly more than

215
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,569
half Dutch and we only had one drop out

216
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:39,420
now we have

217
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,090
20:17 27 or 26 teams and we have

218
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,280
challenges we had a total of 21

219
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,380
challenges divided over seven categories

220
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,839
of which during the entire run of the

221
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,800
course only two challenges were remained

222
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,190
unsolved

223
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,550
this means that almost every team only

224
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:59,130
the team that dropped out didn't solve a

225
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,560
challenge so everybody who tried got

226
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:06,240
points which as an organizer makes us

227
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,979
very happy now organizing CTF is

228
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,920
difficult because you have a very wide

229
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,170
range of skills and you can see that in

230
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,560
the score because we had 27 teams of

231
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:22,229
which four teams scored below a thousand

232
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:25,969
if we continue only six teams scored

233
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:29,510
above 5,000 that means that six teams

234
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:37,010
pretty much beat 75% of the rest

235
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:39,569
now remember top six starts at 5,000 no

236
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,819
we had dynamic scoring which means that

237
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,700
scores go up and down based on the

238
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,730
number of souls and if we go to the

239
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,540
third team third-place team they solved

240
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,400
six challenges oh sorry 14 challenges

241
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,930
five first Bloods six second Bloods one

242
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:02,310
third blood they had a total of 8,000

243
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:04,800
points this is a team that has been here

244
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,780
with us for for a while I looked it up

245
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,010
the first time that they've been on this

246
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,120
stage which means the first time they've

247
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,860
been in the top three was 2013 and since

248
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,220
then they've been here this will be

249
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:21,090
their fifth time so I would like to ask

250
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,950
to the stage to Rita do we owe you

251
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,830
already have the prize money on the

252
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,550
screen I would like to ask to the front

253
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:39,810
team hackers for the $500 reward

254
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:43,699
[Applause]

255
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:57,780
[Music]

256
00:15:43,700 --> 00:16:00,210
so purchase congratulations now this

257
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,189
team we're here standing with $500 but

258
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,770
that's not all they will get because

259
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,870
this year there was something special

260
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,630
which is that the first-place team will

261
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:12,690
be flown in to Abu Dhabi for the CTF

262
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,850
over there now we have three p.m. three

263
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,450
teams in the top three two of which

264
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:21,300
already are qualified so you are now

265
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,310
eligible to be flown in into Abu Dhabi

266
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,469
for the next Jeff where there's I think

267
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:29,599
a total prize pool of $100,000 so good

268
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,140
luck

269
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:43,310
[Applause]

270
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:48,480
and uh yeah this really now third place

271
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:51,599
roughly 8,000 points not too bad if you

272
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,870
consider that 75% scores below blows

273
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,589
five we go to the second place second

274
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:02,130
place did 16 challenges so only two more

275
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:05,280
than the third place three first plots 3

276
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:08,490
second blots one third blood but because

277
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,049
they solve different challenges they got

278
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,970
a total of ten thousand three hundred

279
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:17,609
fourteen points now I just said that the

280
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,260
last team they are a well-known face for

281
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,079
us they've been here for ages

282
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,359
this team is a new team first year that

283
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,510
they participate in our CTF so we are

284
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,549
very happy to see them can I have to the

285
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,960

so congratulations

289
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:17,249
so and then now first place a whooping

290
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:20,999
$1,500 goes to a team whose name we've

291
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:22,950
never seen before that's only because I

292
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,349
change it or actually it's the name of a

293
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,909
combination team but the only members

294
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:31,019
here we're a team that we already know

295
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:32,909
and they solved 17 challenges so that's

296
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,279
one more than the previous team five

297
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:40,919
first blood for second blood 1 first

298
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:45,359
blood the difference just above 1000

299
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,830
points they've been a regular here that

300
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:52,399
I think the first time they were here on

301
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:55,529
stage was in 2014 that is five years ago

302
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:58,488
I've never seen them leave the stage

303
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:01,229
here so they've been here for five times

304
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:03,210
to talk this is our fifth time this is

305
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:06,960
