1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:13,559
I am absolutely delighted thrilled

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,210
really to be back to help celebrate 10

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,150
years of hack in the Box in Amsterdam I

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:23,310
have revered this conference for a

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,939
decade and been privileged to

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,359
participate in it both in Amsterdam and

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:34,770
Kuala Lumpur what I'm going to address

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,070
is after 25 years of working closely

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,870
with technologists security

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,030
professionals and intelligence

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,610
professionals and growing with the

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,510
industry I want to take a step back and

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,170
and see what has been done to us by

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,629
ourselves what we have created and a

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,340
little bit on the dark side what we

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,059
should take responsibility for both

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,640
doing and if there is any way to

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,539
ameliorate some of what we have done to

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,170
do that we all know that the Arab Spring

20
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:14,280
turned into a long cold bitter Arab

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,430
winter we all know that our president

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,240
here in the United States recently

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:24,270
praised Egypt which imprisons thousands

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,210
and thousands of political prisoners for

25
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,939
wanting to advocate on behalf of

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,759
democracy we all know that the movement

27
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,570
toward authoritarian governments seems

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,560
to be gaining in momentum and power and

29
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,130
once people have the tools of

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,990
surveillance intrusion technology's

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,199
domination and control in their hands as

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,679
we have seen implemented so successfully

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,640
in China to monitor every detail of a

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,810
person's life we seldom get that freedom

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,460
back we have no choice however to ask

36
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,220
how we exercise free agency and autonomy

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:13,160
using those tools ourselves in the world

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,350
we have created the ethics of our lives

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,390
in the world of technology are ambiguous

40
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:23,900
at best I know how surprised I was when

41
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:27,410
a hacker professional that I had

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,240
esteemed was revealed to have sold those

43
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:34,490
tools of control to governments that use

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,510
them that is the zero days he had

45
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:41,990
discovered which could be used to track

46
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,359
identify persecute and torture and kill

47
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:48,530
people who opposed the directions of the

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,410
government what side are you on what are

49
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,470
the signs these days how do we determine

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:59,270
what they are how do we determine who we

51
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:07,340
can trust what are our options given the

52
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:09,800
panopticon only Big Brother's but dozens

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,490
of little brothers I'll be exploring

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,400
some of these issues in my keynote and

55
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:19,660
look forward to seeing my colleagues and

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,660
my friends
