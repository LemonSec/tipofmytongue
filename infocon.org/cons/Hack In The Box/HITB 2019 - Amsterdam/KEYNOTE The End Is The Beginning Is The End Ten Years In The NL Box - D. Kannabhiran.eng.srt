00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,570
of you guys went to watch football last

night probably so thanks so much for

5
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,699
being here at like 8:30 I was a 45 but

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,790
you know still thanks a lot for taking

7
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,470
the time to be here ten years ten years

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,620
man Hackett box ten years in the

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:48,070
Netherlands definitely when I started

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,470
this way way back in 2002 2003 I

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,350
certainly didn't envision that I would

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,149
be standing here now ten years after in

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,510
the Netherlands presenting this keynote

14
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,460
to you guys and so this Kino is actually

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,079
kind of a filler actually because

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,690
original keynote speaker couldn't make

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,700
it and then I invited Rob hunk right who

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,110
I'm sure most of you guys know and he

19
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,610
said I don't like speaking anymore bro

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,970
I'm retired

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,740
why don't you do it okay I guess I will

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,149
present the keynote then and ask the

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,100
guys and they said yeah okay fine man

24
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,420
you present it man you know come up with

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,490
something cool tell some stories you'll

26
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,840
be fun you only have half an hour so

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,089
like you know don't don't waste so much

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,360
time so I'm going to try and make this

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,270
fast it's going to be kind of a story

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,100
time with Dylan more or less like a look

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,380
back over what we've been doing over the

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:40,770
last 10 years and a little bit of what

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:44,530
going to be doing in the future once a

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,759
there we go so a bit of history some of

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,590
you guys maybe you've been hanging about

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,329
before some of you guys maybe it's your

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,590
first time here

38
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:55,210
we started in Malaysia 2000 2003 that

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,420
was actually where hack and box was

40
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:04,199
first from right so back in the day when

41
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,520
we first started it the main aim of why

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,019
we wanted to create this hack nabob

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,690
security conference thing was because it

44
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,970
was super super expensive to go to

45
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,260
blackhat Def Con mainly all of the cool

46
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,200
convinces were happening in North

47
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,970
America we were living in Malaysia way

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,738
over there and there wasn't really

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,640
anything cool so we said hey you know we

50
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,430
should we should start our own

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,910
conference man I wiII be fine it should

52
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,950
be easy right it was a lot more work

53
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,269
than we thought but our main aim was to

54
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,589
try and bring kind of like a high

55
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,140
quality event with

56
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,319
like super high cause a conference

57
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,518
that's run by us for us so I will feel

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,649
what we want to do what we are

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,060
interested in what cool technology what

60
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,760
cool talks like you know that we want to

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,340
see what awesome speakers that we want

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,310
to invite and it should be kind of like

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,080
a showcase area for all things hacker

64
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,730
you know and we should try and keep it

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,280
as affordable as we could as you could

66
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,690
possibly make it and and let it be open

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,760
to everybody that as many people as

68
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,709
possible come and learn have that true

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,690
hackers period of learning of sharing

70
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,480
you know and like back in the in the

71
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:12,940
good old days of the community and so

72
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,319
while we take what we produce very

73
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,200
seriously as in when we do our

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,780
conferences we give it let's sweat and

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,869
tears we also know how to have a good

76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,010
time basically and sometimes people say

77
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,349
we don't really tell ourselves that

78
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,420
seriously in fact I would say some

79
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,730
people might even say it hack in the box

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,518
actually organizes parties and then the

81
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,170
conference's are a byproduct of that

82
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,940
organization that we do and we've been

83
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,380
pretty much everywhere right all around

84
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,380
the world we've been in Bahrain we were

85
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,780
in Dubai obviously for Malaysia we've

86
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,930
been in Netherlands but one thing though

87
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,700
is that the community that that runs

88
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,340
hack in the box that's behind hack in

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,608
the box run by people who literally love

90
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,590
what they do they breathe it they

91
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,090
they're so passionate about it and they

92
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,680
believe in what we're trying to do which

93
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,660
is to create a community a space where

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,790
everybody feels safe feels welcome and

95
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:09,269
you can talk about cool stuff man and

96
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:12,340
you know it's about a lot sharing so

97
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,079
common question right is how exactly

98
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,519
that hack in a box come to the

99
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,200
Netherlands because everybody kind of

100
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,389
says like the heck is the connection

101
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,450
dude you guys are from Malaysia how did

102
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:24,070
you end up here and so some say oh must

103
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,950
be you know we heard this story Dylan

104
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,270
has that relatives true story I do have

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,310
that relatives and I've been coming here

106
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,049
for many many years and then some other

107
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,880
guys say oh it must be because you know

108
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,919
it's Amsterdam right sights and sounds

109
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,789
or Amsterdam which is also true I mean

110
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,260
who doesn't want to come to Amsterdam

111
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:40,719
right you tell having comprehension

112
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,550
everybody wants to go but here's the

113
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:44,990
actual true story behind like how hang

114
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:48,960
in a box Netherlands came to be

115
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:52,350
so for most of you you might know these

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,820
three characters basically let's be

117
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,170
actual Darryl

118
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:00,300
that's Amy and Belinda and these three

119
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,340
guys essentially kind of started hacking

120
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,720
the box with me I came out this crazy

121
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,340
idea of like there's a news conference

122
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,130
and there was like kind of the backbone

123
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,599
and the guys that that made it possible

124
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,830
for me to kind of come up with the crazy

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,540
ideas that the ones who were like

126
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,659
alright let's try and make it make it so

127
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,940
and obviously we have a community of

128
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,250
volunteers that are behind us and you

129
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,190
know we we will find you know we went

130
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,510
around we were you know in uh in Bahrain

131
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,780
for a couple of years and then you know

132
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,490
in Dubai everything was was going okay I

133
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,169
mean hanging Abbas was growing we had a

134
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:38,520
Malaysian community we were doing kind

135
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:41,130
of cool stuff and in 2009 I believe 2009

136
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,710
there was this dude that came up with

137
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,980
our comprehensive Malaysia or Barry van

138
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,080
Kampen and so hope this guy Barry came

139
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,490
and then he met up with us and say hey

140
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,530
man this conference things we can

141
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,960
expensive and it's awesome man I love it

142
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,880

143
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,030
bring this over to the Netherlands I'm

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,740
like well we can I suppose I mean but we

145
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,510

148
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,599
time over here and he said no no worries

149
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,820
bro I got it we've got a hackerspace

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,530
it's called random data and we've got

151
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,630
this community of guys from 2600

152
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,580
Netherlands and we will do it together

153
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,080
we'll make this community feel like you

154
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,190
know we will bring hang balls over and

155
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,870
you'll be awesome coincidentally that

156
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,440
particular year was also when Rob Hong

157
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,660
cried Rob that I just mentioned earlier

158
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,550
was keynoting for us in Malaysia and so

159
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,630
for those of you don't know Rob was like

160
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,540
you know the founder of hack take

161
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,810
founder of access for all he's a guy who

162
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,430
hacked the voting machines he's also one

163
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,650
of the main guys who was kind of

164
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,300
involved with the CCC hacker camp scene

165
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,390
so if you never been for like this

166
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,680
summer camp that CCC does you should it

167
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,570
happens once every four years is

168
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,390
fantastic it's like sometimes in Germany

169
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,760
sometimes it's here and so basically we

170
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,300
you know Rob had this idea of like well

171
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,710
we only do

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,389
hacker camps every four years we don't

173
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,099
really have security conference like on

174
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,349
a yearly basis not a community-driven

175
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:07,169
conference there are commercial comments

176
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:09,210
obviously so we said all right that's

177
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,090
you know maybe try and do this thing so

178
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,409
Barry together with at that time his his

179
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,068
boss at that time was this guy called

180
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:19,379
Francisco and so buried in Francisco his

181
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,020
company I think you were robbed together

182
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,150
with some of the guys from ccc helped

183
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,919
helped to bring hacking abbas over as in

184
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,539
ID givers at the support and the

185
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,919
motivation to continue to do it and

186
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:33,449
that's pretty much the history of how

187
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,549
hack in the box netherlands was born

188
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,919
basically right like it was this story

189
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,020
that happened way back in 2009 and it

190
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,690
was Barry who was Barry's in the

191
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,909
audience even I hope he is yeah very man

192
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,710
yeah so it was very who pretty much kind

193
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:49,770
of like started it all right as Barry

194
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,370
it's junk stick orange hat guy at

195
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,128
registration

196
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,400
it's Yuri's this bunch of guys that kind

197
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:58,080
of like the original Nexus for hacking

198
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,388
box and I'm glad that they're still here

199
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,130
today and they're still standing here to

200
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:07,620
be here with us today but obviously you

201
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,380
know since 2009 when we had a small

202
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,990
group of dudes we've gone quite a fair

203
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,060
bit I mean I don't know what the number

204
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,620
is now but it's it's quite large

205
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,150
basically I think when before us is how

206
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,310
many crew there are in evidence I think

207
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:25,349
it's 60 maybe 70 something like that so

208
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,979
what I want to do now though is to

209
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:31,500
introduce you guys to the crew that have

210
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,689
been involved in the run-up to the event

211
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,190
so putting on a conference like this is

212
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,589
not something you do in two weeks or

213
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,909
three weeks or four or six or eight it

214
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:40,949
takes months months and months and

215
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,990
months and months of work in general it

216
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,670
takes about six months and so we

217
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,529
normally put together what we call like

218
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,060
a core crew or like you know they're all

219
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,410
volunteers right nobody works like a box

220
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,930
right but we put together like a

221
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,269
pre-event crew and these guys have like

222
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,000
lived I'd breeze hanging the Box lived I

223
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,560
repeat I continuously everything to do

224
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,390
with this conference for the for the

225
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,779
tenth year anniversary conference for

226
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:07,230
the last six months so first up we have

227
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,370
Terry who is our new team lead and

228
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,100
volunteer coordinator

229
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,500
she's been responsible for making sure

230
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,360
all of the people who say I want to help

231
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,980
out have actually something to do it

232
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,220
they don't just come here and I to do

233
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:23,310
that thumbs we also have obviously mr.

234
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,960
Yuri vent SWAT Yuri has been with

235
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,030
hacking the box for quite some time also

236
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,920
he is responsible for all things hacks

237
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,810
books so if you go outside later and you

238
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,250
go into the exhibition area you see all

239
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,939
the build-up and all the awesome stuff

240
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:39,060
that's all Yuri helping him this year

241
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,520
has been staff from Kathy and Richie as

242
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,040
staff has been helping us with all the

243
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,600
villages and communities so for this

244
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,030
year's 10th year anniversary we decided

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,620
to invite villages over so normally we

246
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,990
just kind of like do you know we have

247
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,670
the usual suspects that will show up but

248
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,260
this year we said hey let's try and have

249
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,060
a call for villagers and a call for

250
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,860
communities and Steph was the main guy

251
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,790
who was responsible for coordinating all

252
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,940
of that obviously I capture the flag

253
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,280
which is like super famous competition

254
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,220
is run this year by this guy called

255
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,100
Oscar ping must in he together with the

256
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,140
rest of the Dutch NL crew CTF crew have

257
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,380
been doing the CTF I think right now for

258
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,069
at least five years solid and so this

259
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,140
year

260
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,990
CTF master of masters will be the scope

261
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,880
and of course the Dutch crew is

262
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,580
supported by our Malaysian team all the

263
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,370
way back in Kuala Lumpur and we have her

264

266
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,900
of these AV stuff so all of the screens

267
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,690

268
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,970

269
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,150

283
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,970
for this year's conference that you know

284
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,199
he helped to keep it all together but of

285
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,540
course you know I mean this bunch of

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,090
guys can do a super huge conference on

287
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,770
their own and so we what we have what we

288
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,450
call our extended crew right volunteers

289
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,930
that have grown from

290
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,800
ten guys to 40 guys to 70 guys and in

291
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,529
this year we actually have more than 90

292
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,790
volunteers from around the world who

293
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:44,910
have come to make Hackney box awesome

294
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:47,040
thanks we actually even have 13 students

295
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,639
from Dakota State University that have

296
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,380
come literally just two full cables so

297
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,389
you know I mean big up to these guys for

298
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,130
believing in this idea that we have for

299
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,630
hack in the box and for you know

300
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,420
everybody could do other stuff right I

301
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,470
mean I'm sure that we rather be outside

302
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,389
cycling that bicycle it's quite a nice

303
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,610
day but yeah they're here you know

304
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,290
helping us out and it's really kind of

305
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,110
like this constant changing constantly

306
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,699
evolving pool of people that come

307
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,829
together every year or for every event

308
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:17,519
bring new ideas they have new energy new

309
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:19,229
concepts and new enthusiasm and that's I

310
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,360
think really what makes second of all

311
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:29,000
second box right it's that is that

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:31,380
evolved evolution of stuff so 2018 was

313
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,550
freakin fantastic man it was for us

314
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,350
anyway it was a really really

315
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,719
interesting year I mean we we did quite

316
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,680
a lot of stuff in fact we did four

317
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,570
conferences which is a little bit crazy

318
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,290
so as always we had our MCM conference

319
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,870
last year it was a big event I think we

320
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,459
had quite lost because I can't remember

321
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,720
exact number but it was a lot it was a

322
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,959
pretty big event if so I think we have

323
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,000
like a thousand five hundred people of

324
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,768
course we did our Singapore conference G

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,350
sack where we let the audience choose

326
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,000
the talks and we network speakers

327
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,260
together with with audience with you

328
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,860
guys you guys get to network with each

329
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,140
other and every did something new and it

330
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,839
starts to go to China why not right

331
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,660
because Beijing China lots of cool

332
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,339
hackers there and the main reason why we

333
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,680
thought we should go to China was simple

334
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,899
it's very simple if you look over the

335
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,510
last couple of years there's been a kind

336
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,699
of a skew in research where research

337
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,470
come from like it used to be mainly

338
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,019
North Americans because Europeans

339
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,000
because it's really seekers but then

340
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,540
over the last maybe three four years or

341
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,880
so there's been like a very big uptick

342
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,880
in the

343
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,950
of Chinese researchers that come in fact

344
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,270
this year's packing a box Lyceus agna

345
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,500
votes if we look at the agenda you'll

346
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,660
see there's lots of Chinese research

347
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,070
papers so we thought it's not always

348
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,540
fair the other researchers to come out

349
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,800
we should actually go there and do

350
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,329
something for the community there so we

351
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,420
did we went to Beijing we did a

352
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,360
conference there and it was quite insane

353
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,099
because number one the the number of

354
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,750
people that showed up was large I mean

355
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,100
normally when we do a conference even

356
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,080
here it's like a thousand thousand how

357
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,210
many people and we've been here for a

358
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,310
while right for a first-time conference

359
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,330
in Beijing we hit like almost 2000

360
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,489
people like a thousand pound people

361
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,800
which for us is quite quite a large

362
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,990
number but what was most mind-blowing

363
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,479
was that we normally do a live stream so

364
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,190
the hack sportrack or the compact track

365
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,780
its stream live on our youtube channel

366
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:28,480
and we get around maybe 2000 2500

367
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,780
concurrent viewers at any time and we're

368
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,410
like people watching the stream and cool

369
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:38,310
stuff we did it in China and we had two

370
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,079
hundred and seventy-five thousand

371
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,829
concurrent viewers viewing the stream

372
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:48,220
which is just a completely mind-blowing

373
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:52,660
number to us basically so yeah so we did

374
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,100
China it was fun and then the Dubai

375
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,110
government kind of like call us up and

376
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,000
say hey man we saw you guys are doing

377
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,070
some cool stuff you haven't been back

378
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,500
here for a long time when she come back

379
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,480
and check it out and so in typical

380
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,760
balloon fashion is like yeah man seems

381
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,290
seems okay I mean we can do it recon

382
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,810
versus white women do for conferences

383
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,969
seems alright all the guys are like do

384
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,500
you crazy or what man like we got this

385
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,020
new China thing you want to go and Dubai

386
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,360
go and do Dubai also I mean I was a hell

387
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,100
man I'm like well let's just try it you

388
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,990
know I mean it seems interesting they

389
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,790
say you know lots of good support there

390
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,280
and you know it'd be it'd be a good

391
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,530
event let's go and check it out and so

392
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,060
we did we've been back to Dubai we did a

393
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:34,660
conference last year at the end of last

394
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,979
year and so we were in Dubai previously

395
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,709
right we were at two thousand seven

396
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,850
eight nine ten and things have changed

397
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,350
things have changed quite a lot I mean

398
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,080
we took an eight-year break but the

399
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,810
community there has has evolved has

400
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,250
evolved quite a lot what the main thing

401
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,410
that we actually saw was that there's a

402
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,470
huge huge amount of young

403
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,509
she showed up we do these things here as

404
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,850
well call hack in the class it's a Dutch

405
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:00,899
foundation co-founded berry and myself

406
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,490
co-founded it that aims to teach kids

407
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:04,870
the hacker mindset like how to think

408
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,939
like a hacker how to problem-solve

409
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,850
things and so we ran a hack in the cloud

410
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:11,680
session in in Dubai and we had like a

411
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,420
hundred and twenty kids actually full

412
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,160
full session over like the two days it

413
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,990
was just full and so these are twelve to

414
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,939
fifteen year old kids and it was it's

415
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,009
really heartening to see them really get

416
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:24,009
into it really you know like want to

417
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,500
push themselves further we have our edu

418
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:29,560
CTF as as usual and then we had like 20

419
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,790
over teams compete there was even one

420
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,589
particular team I think they're from

421
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,569
University Abu Dhabi I can't really

422
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,490
remember the team's name but those guys

423
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:38,290
haven't played CTF ever before in their

424
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,759
life I mean their students and they have

425
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,889
I mean the computer science students and

426
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,600
they know some some things but they've

427
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,339
never competed before as a team

428
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,860
collaboratively and worked on a problem

429
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,870
together and they came in played and

430
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,889
they did really well at Nina came in

431
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,920
second or they came in third

432
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,839
they were also like a lot of women which

433
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,189
to me was surprising because normally we

434
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,560
think you know there's a shortage of

435
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,730
women in IT and women in security right

436
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,739
there's a common problem that we

437
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,030
obviously in Europe in USI everybody is

438
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,789
talking about diversity diversity

439
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,230
diversity yet in the UAE

440
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:10,179
this isn't seem to be a problem there's

441
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,079
a huge amount of Women Engineers that

442
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:16,480
actually came for the event and a lot of

443
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,908
them were former students basically and

444
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,579
from a master's post-grad undergrad high

445
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:23,620
school students most of them almost all

446
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,569
of them super hungry and super excited

447
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,639
to learn like we had villagers like how

448
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:29,830
we had here we have soldiering and we

449
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,059
had like you know car hacking and stuff

450
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,960
and it was packed

451
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:34,270
it was literally packed there were

452
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,760
people like two three people you know

453
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,679
queued up to to learn and and it was

454
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:44,230
very nice to see super super refreshing

455
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:47,380
but you know at the end of every year at

456
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,360
the end of every conference we almost

457
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,710
always get asked like a standard same

458
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,969
question by people which is a what cool

459
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,730
stuff are you gonna do next year when

460
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,799
this year was so great but like next

461
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,610
year what's plan what's the plan man and

462
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:05,770
so while we've been doing this

463
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,840
quite some time there are a couple of

464
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:12,129
things that we've noticed that seem to

465
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,399
be changing or evolving and I guess

466
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,130
that's kind of to be expected right the

467
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,750
first is that technology technology is

468
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,130
going to constantly change right we're

469
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,900
constantly going to be talking about

470
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,610
building stuff breaking it I mean that's

471
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,880
that's what we do that's what hacking is

472
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,879
right

473
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,030
excuse me but also the people have

474
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,580
changed as well

475
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,899
I mentioned this now how much like you

476
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,240
know previously researchers used to come

477
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,780
from Israel from Europe from America and

478
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,549
then now it's mainly from Asia and you

479
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,160
also see that the culture the culture of

480
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:46,510
hacking right has changed a lot when we

481
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,640
started hanging the box there was like a

482
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,350
handful of conferences right now there's

483
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,750
I call them no setting hollering Mia did

484
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,040
some study 375 conferences in a year

485
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,990
means more conferences than there are

486
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,280
days and there's a conference for

487
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,809
everything like whatever your

488
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,850
specialization is whatever it is that

489
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,270
that keeps you up at night that drives

490
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,668
you

491
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,950
let's probably a conference for it also

492
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:07,540
the way that we share information is

493
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,340
also changed as well I mean there wasn't

494
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,559
YouTube right like so now you consume

495
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,010
content quite differently you can share

496
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:18,700
information differently as well I mean

497
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:21,490
github all of that stuff also generally

498
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,580
the culture of the industry has shifted

499
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,950
drastically when we first started it in

500
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,510
2003 Microsoft was an AA sponsor they've

501
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,669
been a sponsor now for I don't know a

502
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,750
very very very very long time but when

503
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,460
we first started it they were not a

504
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:37,870
sponsor they were not really our friends

505
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,669
even it used to be back 2003 2004 if you

506
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,590
drop some zero day stuff you get cease

507
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:43,780
and desist right you don't get a bug

508
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,399
bounty she's nobody's gonna give you

509
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,928
like a pattern of back nobody's gonna

510
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,780
give you a hall of fame on the website

511
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,309
it was very different yet today you know

512
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,559
you have contests around the world where

513
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:57,340
people specifically go just to drop

514
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,290
research drop zero day walk away with

515
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,760
five hundred thousand 100 thousand

516
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,290
whatever 1 million I don't know I think

517
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,510
they give away at Tesla or Sydney at

518
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,610
fondo on it's getting more and more I

519
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,160
mean the numbers are insane busy right

520
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,110
and so that's a super super different

521
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,059
world and we lived in way back not that

522
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,439
long ago I mean 2003 while it seems like

523
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,410
a very long time ago isn't really that

524
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:21,120
long any things of cultural

525
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:23,010
pollution right yes people and so the

526
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,350
long and short of it though is that even

527
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,250
though all of these things have changed

528
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,510
technology people and culture we're

529
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,080
still here talking about the same thing

530
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,200
right this stuff is broken stuff is not

531
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,629
like as you expect it to be privacy

532
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,830
issues data at rest all of this

533
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,510
it's all the same it's all the same

534
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,189
security problems that we have

535
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:49,560
inherently been facing and been talking

536
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:51,360
about and so the reason I think that is

537
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,250
is because I think most of us can agree

538
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,780
right security is not a technology thing

539
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,810
right it's not going to be solved by

540
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:00,330
putting more firewalls or more whatever

541
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,770
next fancy AI sets you want to put on

542
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,689
top of it it's not going to be solving

543
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,090
technology right because it's

544
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,850
essentially a people problem right it's

545
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,030
people doing stupid that results in

546
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,810
in in issues and so how do you actually

547
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:18,960
solve people problems I think through

548
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,370
education really and right now most of

549
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,010
us will probably agree that there's a

550
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,709
huge gap in what the education industry

551
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,660
is providing and what we as in the

552
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,080
general companies and industry

553
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,820
themselves are expecting so we as

554
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,879
companies one the best brightest

555
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,179
smartest best guys that we can join our

556
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,970
team immediately series are producing

557
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,440
stuff or graduates that you can't deploy

558
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,610
immediately you have to train them

559
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,740
you're descendent for whatever

560
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,189
certification or in training comes to

561
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,620
convince as little more stuff and so why

562
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,810
is that right it's mainly because we're

563
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,510
using like a 200 year old method of

564
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,669
teaching the next generation which is

565
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,610
essentially read this stuff

566
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:06,560
memorize it come to an exam spit it back

567
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:09,719
out and I'll grade you on it yet today

568
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:12,240
today's kids two three years old they

569
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,780
have an iPad they really know how to

570
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,470
navigate ui/ux like of an iPad before

571
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,060
they can even speak when I was younger

572
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,820
not two three but maybe seven eight

573
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:26,040
years old I had books big-ass heavy

574
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,889
books you know made of trees and stuff

575
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,360
you couldn't search you had to actually

576
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,410
read it you know

577
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,449
you couldn't go to youtube and just

578
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,330
watch some videos and learn stuff right

579
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,070
but right now kids today you can learn

580
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,379
anything I mean we can essentially learn

581
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,810
anything we want right but our school

582
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,360
systems still have books still have

583
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:49,409
exams still have this greater mentality

584
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,510
of you know an old way of teaching what

585
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,910
we essentially need to do is not expect

586
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,400
kids to learn the way we teach right but

587
00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:00,750
to kind of teach kids the way they learn

588
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,660
and so how how do do what do we need to

589
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,480
do actually we say wanna teach kids you

590
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,240
know back away right it's not hot it's

591
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,490
essentially breaking a big problem into

592
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,740
bite-sized pieces and keep at it

593
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,180
it's that grit that tenacity that's what

594
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,640
makes us hackers we don't give up we

595
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,060
don't say our five o'clock time to go

596
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,760
home

597
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,889
we don't we stay up to 5:00 a.m. until

598
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,330
we get what it is that were searching

599
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,730
for right is that constant Drive

600
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,110
constant push and that's why we started

601
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,900
hacking the class that's why Barry and I

602
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,159
said a man like you know if we're hoping

603
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,870
to solve this problem we need to go

604
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,250
further back I mean like it's no point

605
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,600
talking to university students in high

606
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,090
school kids it's like yeah that's all

607
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,949
fine and well but their their mindset

608
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,439
and the way that they look at things are

609
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,820
kind of already fairly in green so you

610
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,080
kind of gotta go when they're much

611
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:52,320
younger 10 12 13 14 15 and make them

612
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,120
kind of excited about technology not

613
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,980
push them in to learn this tool you can

614
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,360
become a hacker that's bull man it's a

615
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,650
mind it's a way of thinking right it's

616
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,389
not about the tool I can teach anybody

617
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,550
the tool man like tools dumb tools go

618
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,750
but its young it's a way of flag how you

619
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,290
approach a problem how you live your

620
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,850
life but how else do we learn we as

621
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,560
people just generally write small so

622
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,629
most of times trial and error right kids

623
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,190
kids learn by falling down picking

624
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,690
themselves up touching something hot oh

625
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,080
it's hot I burned myself I don't do it

626
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,860
again

627
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,710
and that's why we think CTS are so

628
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,199
essential yet most companies and most of

629
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,610
the industry isn't really using it for

630
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,800
what it should be useful which is a

631
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,800
recruitment tool it's like the fastest

632
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,720
easiest way to spot Talent and that's

633
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,399
why most companies sponsor CTF actually

634
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,930
most companies are here sponsoring

635
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,760
hacking the balls over the last couple

636
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,990
of years is to spot Talent it's a global

637
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,100
problem we have this talent shortage

638
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,460
right we're all looking for the best

639
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,100
guys hard to find

640
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,289
if the train even harder to evaluate

641
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,090
right evaluation is difficult everybody

642
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,260
keeps saying on the CV I know this I

643
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,270
know this I know that but how do you

644
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,299
test how do you actually make sure they

645
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,250
can deliver it right fastest way CTS

646
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,460
also they're a great way to you know

647
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,990
we'll build teams within your company as

648
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,070
well it teaches you how to work with

649
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,840
each other even though you might hate

650
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,158
each other on a day to day there are

651
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,689
times you will need to work with each

652
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,200
other departments need to talk to each

653
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,970
other and so we started a new CTF for

654
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,770
that same reason as well to try and

655
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,929
create a way for companies to earmark

656
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,639
students that are performing well or

657
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:23,390
that have like you know a really good

658
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,100
chance of succeeding and you know making

659
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:31,940
sure that they don't get lost in the

660
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:34,820
system and so when we have to start

661
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,220
planning for this year and the tenth

662
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,809
year anniversary and basically what do

663
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,340
we want to do right we've been around

664
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:41,870
for quite some time already like hacking

665
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,020
a box right what do we want to focus on

666
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,689
and we I mean I've talked to the guys

667
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,179
and basically we said you know everyone

668
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,429
to do literally do something and leave a

669
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,110
legacy because we're all getting old I

670
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:56,809
mean I don't know if you know this quite

671
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,879
a lot of gray hair and we want to fix

672
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,899
this education situation right which we

673
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,179
should try and give it a go

674
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:03,830
so we said fine we're gonna amp up all

675
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:05,570
our activities for this year moving

676
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,720
forward basically and focus on the next

677
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:11,510
generation hackers so try and do stuff

678
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,429
or for the younger guys right and and

679
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:18,020
and keep them motivated and keep them

680
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:20,330
going forward so for MCM this year we

681
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,760
decided to pretty much ramp every single

682
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,260
thing that we have up like to the max

683
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,809
right so hacks of future pass was the

684
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,820
team that we came up with and we were

685
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,399
gonna focus on next generation hacks and

686
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,039
old school Hanks and the future and what

687
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:37,370
what what stuff is is currently you know

688
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:41,299
day to day and so we've got pretty much

689
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:43,399
four tracks of talks I think we had 200

690
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,799
plus CFP submissions 60 some things

691
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,270
because CIP review both people are here

692
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:52,220
so you can ask them a why didn't you

693
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:55,879
select my talk we also have 30 plus

694
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,659
villages and competitions the most I

695
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,590
think that we've ever had

696
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,490
we also have black hoodie or women

697
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,830
engineering track so that's a new

698
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,259
addition for us as well which we think

699
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,480
is cool really cool addition we also

700
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,730
have a women-only CTF that's going to be

701
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,070
running on day two of course we have our

702
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,659
pro CTF with 27 teams from around Europe

703
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,970
and the winning team from here is

704
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:22,080
actually gonna go to UAE to compete in

705
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,940
something really cool which I'll tell

706
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,100
you guys about shortly

707
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,840
we also expand the hack in the class so

708
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,330
we normally have our hanging to class

709
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,559
stuff but we invited Pete Herzog and the

710
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,199
guys from hacker high school they're

711
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,639
doing really really good work in the US

712
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,409
and we invited them to come and expand

713
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:38,998
on what we're doing so we actually have

714
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:42,240
now hack in a class class at the high

715
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:45,960
school and of course my personal

716
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,309
favorite my a I I decided I don't know

717
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,470
why but I thought it would be a really

718
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:52,019
cool and fun thing to do a self racing

719
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,490
car challenge forgetting that you know I

720
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:55,679
have a lot of other stuff to do as well

721
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,700
so we put it on the website I came up

722
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,799
with the idea can what the rules

723
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,480
assemble a team to do it and then

724
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
realize like man I don't have time to

725
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
actually play around with this so what

726
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,219
we have it we have it that's an AI cell

727
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,918
racing car chalice you guys wanna check

728
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,779
it out it should be quite fun and

729
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,700
basically there's just so much awesome

730
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:13,950
and like over the next two days like use

731
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,990
this opportunity to really learn right

732
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,429
like there's so much stuff like this

733
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,840
most of the talks I looked at some of

734
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,580
the talks in the agenda I have no idea

735
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,249
what the hell this is about and is super

736
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,720
super technical so that's pretty much

737
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:26,669
what we're going to do for MCM right

738
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,409
back that's why we're here today but we

739
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:32,220
of course have Singapore coming up in

740
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:33,659
August it's our surprise surprisingly

741
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,580
this year everything coincide that

742
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,809
because it's our tenth year here it's

743
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,960
actually our fifth year also in

744
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:42,330
Singapore as mentioned jisuk has this

745
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,669
audience voted concept where you get to

746
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,678
decide so CF is currently open if you

747
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,690
want to speak submit your talk and then

748
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,309
we'll let the audience choose so people

749
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,950
who register for the conference get to

750
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,539
vote on which talks they like and then

751
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,389
we kind of put everybody together and

752
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,220
it's an interesting mix in it you know

753
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,678
incorporates kind of like new ideas new

754
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,669
ways of sharing knowledge and so the

755
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,019
Singapore in August there should be

756
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:08,679
quite fun

757
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:10,750
and of course as you AE so like

758
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,759
everybody else at the end of Dubai's

759
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,799
conference and after we you know we

760
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,139
wrapped up and everything was done the

761
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,990
guys from DSC well I okay bro what's

762
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:21,189
next me something what's going on I mean

763
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,049
you know you know we have this thing

764
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,220
called Expo 2020 that's we're going to

765
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:26,320
Dubai in 2020

766
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,240
so what gonna do that was gonna be like

767
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,980
even bigger than this year and leading

768
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,909
up into something that's even huger it

769
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:35,759
went a I'm like okay hmm seeing that I

770
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:38,139
saw the amount of views that came and

771
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,970
that there's so much passion hunger and

772
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:42,519
stuff to learn right I said you know we

773
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,799
we should do something something crazy

774
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:50,379
right I mean typical dealer try like you

775
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:53,139
want to do don't do half I said all

776
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:54,699
right let me think about it whether the

777
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:57,279
guys think about some crazy ideas and

778
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,159
we'll come back to you and so we did we

779
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,590
came up with some not the plans for them

780
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,299
and so they sat on a they thought about

781
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:07,360
it for a while and say man you're us

782
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:10,299
certifiably crazy man but we like it we

783
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,580
like it so let's do it so what we're

784
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:18,639
gonna do anyway something pretty huge

785
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:22,529
we're gonna call it HRT V Plus cyber

786
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:25,209
week what is it it's a multi party

787
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:27,250
week-long security event for both

788
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,649
security professionals all you guys here

789
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,899
all the try and interested guys but also

790
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:33,668
something special and something unique

791
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:35,889
for the next generation for the younger

792
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:37,000
guys so you can think of it as like a

793
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:39,668
chai tea be on steroids

794
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,470
hence the plus but it's also kind of

795
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:43,330
like a multi-stakeholder thing Society

796
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,389
be in collaboration with multiple

797
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,980
parties and we've got a crazy amount of

798
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:52,899
things planned basically over six days

799
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,789
we have 21 activities I don't know how

800
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:56,768
many talks we're gonna have but multiple

801
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:57,940
we're gonna have a lot of trainings a

802
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:59,710
lot of free trainings two days three

803
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,200
days four days trainings will have

804
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,700
multiple workshops that we laughs

805
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,080
there's we villagers obviously we're

806
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,149
gonna invite a lot of the villagers that

807
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,059
you'll see here will be there there'll

808
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:11,649
be lots of challenges but basically it's

809
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,460
so damn great right that we decided that

810
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,979
we should make a video

811
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,690
because you know that's what cool people

812
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,760
do these days writing videos and stuff

813
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,810
so we decided to make a video which I

814
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,810
shall show you guys

815

816
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:38,269
[Music]

817
00:32:42,600 --> 00:33:07,689
[Music]

818
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:17,140
so guys that cyber women like and let me

819
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:23,290
get back to my slides cool so as I was

820
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:25,510
saying we have a lot of crazy stuff

821
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,909
planned man like it's gonna be so nuts

822
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,980
we have been staying up late for the

823
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,630
last couple of days just working on the

824
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,850
last bits of pieces so that we can

825
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,620
announce it to you guys here first up

826
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:39,669
let's have a battle at the Emirates so

827
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,290
this is literally edu CTF spread out

828
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,360
across the training program that's going

829
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,730
to last over five weeks it's mainly for

830
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,959
the UAE universities so we're going to

831
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,370
go to the universities we're gonna go to

832
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,310
almost every single emirate do a

833
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:54,580
training cost for them pick out the best

834
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:56,590
guys form teams put them to an edu CTF

835
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,600
we're flying in the witness from Belgium

836
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,220
and Germany's subscript challenge

837
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,600
they're actually here I don't know if

838
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,490
they do against at the end of this guys

839
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,899
have probably had a late night but

840
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,580
they're on site those guys will be

841
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,370
joining these teams from the UAE the

842
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:13,750
best of the best students its compete

843
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:17,620
and then those guys will join a pro CTF

844
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:21,060
competition and now the pro CTF we are

845
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:24,040
not opening it up to anybody to apply

846
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,619
its kind of pre-selected so we are

847
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,478
selecting

848
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,369
the winning teams from various

849
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:31,728
competitions so for example the winning

850
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:34,700
team from here DEFCON CTF last year a

851
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:38,989
POC code blue we have a whole bunch of

852
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:41,239
PhDs and these winners will be flown on

853
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:44,599
the way over to Abu Dhabi and they'll be

854
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,690
paying for $100,000 cash prize however

855
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,460
we have a subcategory so it's kind of

856
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,619
like an attack and defense ETF and we

857
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,109
have a bonus flag challenges for them

858
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:56,989
and we've built a visualization skin

859
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:59,239
that sits on top why normally when you

860
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:00,859
go for CTF if you're not playing the CTF

861
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,029
is quite boring and then you watch it

862
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,529
it's like yeah you can see the

863
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:05,960
scoreboard it's tough you see teams are

864
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:08,180
hacking things whatever visually when

865
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,380
you look at what people are doing if it

866
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,719
really looks like they're checking email

867
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,969
or they're checking into Facebook right

868
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:16,130
it doesn't really look that that fun so

869
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:17,660
for this particular CTF we're gonna

870
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,979
build a skin that sits on top of the

871
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,839
attack and defense platform it's

872
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:23,118
actually built by ru CTF the hackathon

873
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:24,828
guys who are also here in collaboration

874
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,569
with our Dodge guys and so that we're a

875
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,979
visualization system that sits on top to

876
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:30,558
kind of represent what the team's

877
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:32,899
actions are and your server status and

878
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,640
servers civil health but to make it more

879
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,339
interesting for the audience who's

880
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,788
watching we are considering having a

881
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:42,349
time based concept so each team will

882
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:44,839
have a certain amount of time that they

883
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,180
can spend on hacking the IOT devices

884
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:48,890
that will be made available you in the

885
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,839
audience for as long as you stay in the

886
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,359
room watching the contest you get some

887
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,910
time that's given to you which you can

888
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,529
then donate to the teams that you

889
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,969
support so whichever team that you like

890
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:01,009
you can your so you're part of the

891
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:02,509
competition as well see I should play a

892
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:04,819
role in determining who might wait

893
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:06,079
because you could donate all your time

894
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:08,150
to one particular team and then they

895
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,440
have an unfair advantage right but at

896
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,900
the end of the day we are all bound by

897
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,160
time we all have 24 hours a day seven

898
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,559
days a week so that's the CTF and then

899
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,390
of course because I like AI right I said

900
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,489
a man we should do some AI stuff me I

901
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:24,979
challenge and so they said okay what

902
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:27,469
kind of crazy I stopped you want I said

903
00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:30,078
okay let's do two challenges 50,000 for

904
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:31,940
each category one of which is to take

905
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,380
deep exploit which is a available

906
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,380
framework that's already out there I

907
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,670
make it do something even better and the

908
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,220
other was to

909
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,769
use the open now we're a I gym to train

910
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,629
like a new detector and what would be a

911
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,939
stretch goal would be that you can

912
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,109
modify a PE file using machine learning

913
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,549
but it still works

914
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:53,058
and you need to bypass all of the

915
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:54,829
current AV detectors there'll be some

916
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:56,809
rock star stuff in so we have an AI

917
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:59,269
challenge as well it's actually going to

918
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:01,640
be in two phases first phase is for post

919
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:03,019
grads undergrads and if we don't get

920
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,460
enough submissions because maybe it's

921
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,589
too challenging we'll open it up to

922
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,059
everybody so I'll probably just throw it

923
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:09,589
up on a Cal contest or something so

924
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,940
anybody who is into machine learning a I

925
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,288
if you feel like this is something you

926
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,970
want to do and you want to try and like

927
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:14,569
try your hand at it you're more than

928
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,339
welcome

929
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:18,288
we'll probably open that in maybe June

930
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:20,660
July I'm super running out of time so

931
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:23,839
I'm trying to go fast last but not least

932
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,720
we have different tone so this is

933
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,269
something new it's a bug bounty contest

934
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,609
nothing nothing new about that but it's

935
00:37:29,269 --> 00:37:33,200
also a bug bounty Bazaar so what the

936
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:35,029
hell is that like basically we are

937
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,680
inviting various stakeholders that

938
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:38,299
already have that one bug bounty program

939
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,190
so you know the usual suspects I cannot

940
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:42,230
name them because these are embargo but

941
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,900
those companies that you know we are

942
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,960
inviting them to come and host their own

943
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,519
bounty alongside us so you as a bug

944
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,170
hunter you can go to like a one-stop

945
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,808
place choose whichever bounty program

946
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,980
you like and you you know do your viewer

947
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:57,109
thing

948
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,390
the main differentiator is is that

949
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,098
currently right now as most bounty

950
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,140
programs is just between the vendor and

951
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,579
the hunter we as a community don't

952
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,259
really get know what the hell goes on we

953
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,150
don't really learn anything new other

954
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:10,069
than device we that comes out that's it

955
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,599
so what we're thinking for three is

956
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:13,069
actually pushing things much much

957
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,000
further and doing something out of the

958
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:15,859
ordinary

959
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,410
which is coordinated this culture with a

960
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:19,640
twist so what we want to do is we will

961
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,730
follow the same tried and tested

962
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,379
methodology so you come you present we

963
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,059
will validate we will submit it to the

964
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,460
vendor they will get X number of days to

965
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:29,930
patch after which will issue that visor

966
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,029
II in the meantime you guys got paid

967
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,730
anyway but once the patch is out we'll

968
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:36,319
give a certain window 30 60 90 days for

969
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,970
the patch to propagate so that people

970
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,769
have a chance to actually get secured

971
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,509
and then we want to open source

972
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,729
everything we're gonna open source the

973
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:47,000
the exploit one opens was the actual

974
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:49,579
advisory like n2n so why because

975
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,650
basically we feel that it would push the

976
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,180
entire research community forward if

977
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,740
techniques for I should be disclosed

978
