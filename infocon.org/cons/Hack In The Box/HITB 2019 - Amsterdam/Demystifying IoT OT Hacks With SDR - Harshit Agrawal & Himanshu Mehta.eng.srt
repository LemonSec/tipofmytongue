1
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,710
good afternoon guys so we are gonna be

2
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,840
talking about a series of RF

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,669
exploitation attacks and what are the

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,789
different attack vectors which are

5
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:34,309
focused mostly on physical layer of

6
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,890
communication system reason why is

7
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,140
because mobile in IOT means that

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,720
wireless technologies more diverse in in

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:45,019
Cumberland and it's ever been so with

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,480
dead comes many more attack surfaces so

11
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:50,030
we are very excited to talk about the

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,449
peyote attics and my name is Hershiser

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,340
gravel

14
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:54,379
I am security researcher then an

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,050
undergrad student along with me him and

16
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:02,480
Samantha he's working for humanity case

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,670
of now can you hear me hello

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,220
yeah so I am currently working with

19
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,240
Symantec and I am leading the security

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,149
in claims team there in India and my

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,929
focus have been always on to learn and

22
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,970
explore more into the security field so

23
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm also the board member of ec-council

24
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,150
LPT program like I walk along with them

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,869
and as well as I'm board member of

26
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,540
several other security conferences so so

27
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,950
before we begin with this session we

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,650
need to know how many of you are

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,430
familiar with HDR the software defended

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,890
you okay and how many of you have looked

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,960
into some kind of IOT security or IOT

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:50,180
hacking before ok it's interesting so

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,309
this session is going to be very very

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,450
basic because we got a lot of

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,490
invitations and suggestions from people

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,049
that nobody talks about the basic

37
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,979
sessions so ok let us start here so we

38
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,360
are going to begin with a brief

39
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:12,110
historical rundown of the development of

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,290
the IOT so our today's agenda will be

41
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,660
engineer so evolving radio technology

42
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,359
landscape then security applications of

43
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,720
software-defined radio and what makes

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,910
the secure RF communications unique then

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,669
will be also discussing in brief about

46
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,910
the top wireless vulnerabilities then

47
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:37,000
what are the privacy rules regulations

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:39,579
to RF so in this case like you can see

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,240
the statistic here it shows the number

50
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:47,080
of connected devices worldwide from 2015

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,120
to 2025 so you can see a it's like

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,700
exponential growth like if you see

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:59,440
compared 2015 2020 and 2024 225 so it is

54
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,839
going to expand even in coming future so

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,750
you you you can see here like it is

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,520
almost forecasted to grow to the 31

57
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,340
billion worldwide

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,810
okay so though the overall IOT market is

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,690
projected to be worth more than 1

60
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,360
billion US dollars annually from last

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,640
year onwards and the mote is interesting

62
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,000
part to note about it here is between

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,309
2070 to 2018 there's only 3 percent hike

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,590
in the IOT devices but the Artic

65
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,760
surfaces increased by 600 percent so

66
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,370
deaths really miss you

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
yeah so now a lot of people are learning

68
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,210
about that and they are also applying

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,880
that those techniques to exploit this

70
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,320
IOT vulnerable piece so and you you

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,459
might have also noticed that the

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,590
detection of cryptocurrency - increase

73
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,620
8,500 percent in quarter for in 2017

74
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,690
year right so the attackers nowadays

75
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,940
they are using even some of the

76
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,470
ransomware attacks to attack these IOT

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:59,050
devices and ask for ransoms so if you

78
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,690
see the most important thing in this is

79
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,440
like will be discussing also about the

80
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,170
IOT OT landscape so the combined market

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,750
of IOT you will see is going to be a 520

82
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,329
billion in 2020 one which is massive and

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,660
it can be even more than that what is

84
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,970
projected yeah so there are oou us has

85
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,270
released the top 10 vulnera days for the

86
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,550
IOT and we have highlighted only 5 so

87
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,219
you can have a look in the top 10 module

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,010
so first one is like week guessable

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,470
hard-coded passwords so you know like

90
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,840
most of the devices even manufacturers

91
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,700
vendors they don't really care about

92
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,010
these right so they just give the

93
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,229
hard-coded passwords and you don't even

94
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,510
have the option to change it or maybe

95
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:44,260
you can reset it even after changing so

96
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,120
that is

97
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,270
first problem another one is like

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,100
insecure network services so you can see

99
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,430
there are so many services running on

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,290
the device itself and there are some

101
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,360
services even a vendor does not care

102
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,280
like who is communicating with what ok

103
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,650
so those are actually exposed on the

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,719
internet like if you use the show down

105
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,000
thought IO and all you can see like what

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,950
are the services running and the most

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,980
important thing is like CIA try it like

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,770
confidentiality integrity availability

109
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:16,900
and also the authentication and then

110
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,810
third thing is the important thing is

111
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,909
insecure ecosystem interface is slow so

112
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,370
you will be seeing like lot of API

113
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,860
back-end API is cloud services and

114
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,810
mobile interfaces in the ecosystem which

115
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,940
is outside the device but that also

116
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,430
comprar allows the compromising of the

117
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,030
devices yeah and then fourth is the

118
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,790
secure update mechanism lot of vendors

119
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,799
that don't even use the hashing and

120
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,170
other techniques ok so the lack of

121
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,320
ability to securely update the device

122
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,750
actually makes them more compromising to

123
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,670
these kind of attacks and then the fifth

124
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,250
one which we have highlighted here is

125
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,280
use of insecure or outdated components I

126
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,100
know you all are already aware like even

127
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,559
for OS software's we always ask them to

128
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,870
update so it is same for the IOT devices

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,850
also we always want to update this

130
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,980
components libraries whatever we are

131
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:14,440
using in the IOT devices then this is a

132
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,080
normal a IOT threat model that we

133
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,630
prepared like you can see here like

134
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,550
controlling device so like how the

135
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,280
devices are being controlled like in our

136
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:29,920
smart homes or tablets oh sorry

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,450
ok and other things like whatever smart

138
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
devices you are using so who is

139
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,710
controlling that device that is the

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,140
first threat vector right attack vector

141
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,810
the second one what we figured out was

142
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,610
cloud service so everybody is talking

143
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,370
about cloud service nowadays like

144
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,220
whether it is AWS as you're Google Cloud

145
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,250
ne ne ne service right so they try to

146
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,190
implement that with integrate that with

147
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,320
IOT devices but they don't know about

148
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,969
those injection attacks and has three

149
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,879
bucket leakages so we have to

150
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:02,709
take care of that also then global

151
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,219
network like you know it's connected to

152
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,860
all the Internet related things and then

153
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:11,769
local network like in can if you see

154
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,279
like it is using can in the some of the

155
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:17,919
devices like cars and other models and

156
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,889
that is also a point of compromise for

157
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,419
these devices then things like which can

158
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,789
be remotely controlled it can be

159
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,739
anything like maybe a refrigerator a

160
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:29,169
smart home or anything you support

161
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:31,179
internet of things it's not only date

162
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,219
you need to secure date device but there

163
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:34,869
are so many different attack vectors it

164
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:37,149
might be possible date of which cloud

165
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:39,339
services you are using if dead cloud

166
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:41,799
service is not protected then again your

167
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,659
I to device is possible to Craig s veil

168
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:45,878
is the local network through which which

169
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:48,039
protocols we are using but her I

170
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,379
have one question like can we analyze

171
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,029
what is actually inside radio wave

172
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,789
spectrum that will be interesting to

173
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,589
know yeah so when we talk about what

174
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,139
basically lies inside the radio wave

175
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:01,629
spectrum it's the following figure shows

176
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:03,399
the frequency allocation chart where we

177
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:05,139
can see that different frequencies in

178
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,659
their applications on which these

179
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,639
devices are working we t they need to be

180
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:11,679
concerned from the NTIA in FCC

181
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,259
regulations so they are using death

182
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:16,899
frequencies we can see FM radio

183
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,909
operating on 100 megahertz the GPS n

184
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,610
cell phone somewhat near to 900

185
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:24,429
megahertz while the ats-v signal get

186
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,199
broadcasted on frequency 1090 megahertz

187
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,799
which can be directly captured from your

188
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,999
RTL SDR then you can break any flights

189
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,208
says well as many cars are now

190
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:36,189
controlled from mobile devices over GSM

191
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:38,649
while even more can be unlocked in

192
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:40,659
ignition started from Wireless key fobs

193
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,879
over RF all of these are subject to

194
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,550
attack with low-cost tools such as heck

195
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,850
RF GQ uh Hecker if in our generators

196
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,490
using date we can modify them invisible

197
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,439
in ignored our devices are currently

198
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,189
screamin out large amount of information

199
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:59,410
about us our habits of our patterns as

200
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:01,329
well as what we are doing so we will

201
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,670
show you how to listen in what is

202
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:05,800
commonly been broadcasted what can be

203
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,920
done with this information then how can

204
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,319
we minimize the risk here it's an

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,949
example of vo all might be familiar with

206
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:14,740
a master

207
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,529
it's a scenario from date so seek envy

208
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,170
anyone let's name her allies caring no

209
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:21,910
identity card but still vote she is

210
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,769
carrying is she heading out enough

211
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,649
information yet anyone who cares to

212
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:29,649
listen can find her home know about her

213
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,560
work she vote electronics he owns in

214
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,389
whether or not C got in camera let's

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,180
consider a simplest example of Wi-Fi

216
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:39,100
when not connected to Wi-Fi our phone

217
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,469
yells out probe request asking for

218
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,300
network to connect this probe request

219
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,910
contains phone make address in recent

220
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,519
SSID each make address is unique in

221
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,230
identify manufactures then are encrypted

222
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,209
in Wi-Fi frames through which we can get

223
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,070
to know okay these are the locations he

224
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,018
has been like suppose if you have

225
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,329
connected your Wi-Fi at Amsterdam

226
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,970
Airport so that weakens might be

227
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:02,859
broadcasted in you can trick if someone

228
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,320
is on a trip we can track all of his

229
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,420
history where he has been before this

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,779
Ville is the problem with IOT devices is

231
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,430
its embedded it's unsecured so most of

232
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,310
them are battery-powered limited user

233
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:18,069
interaction Lake of crypto based on

234
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,380
dates let us understand what is HDR the

235
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,390
software-defined radio it's the radio

236
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,640
communication system where components

237
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,439
that have been typically implemented in

238
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,959
hardware like before we used to have

239
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,390
mixers filters amplifier modulators all

240
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,180
of them essence separate unit but now

241
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,730
they are all easily implemented by means

242
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:41,709
of software so using software to replace

243
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:44,290
most of hardware it's earth HDR it uses

244
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,000
the software RF IQ / symbols like the

245
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,890
imaginary if symbols through which we

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,810
can capture the raw data and play with

247
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,430
the signals for modifying in inverse

248
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,589
broadcasting any signal first comes the

249
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,969
source then comes the filter source

250
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,190
which is capturing the signal the

251
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,720
antennas then comes our filters how we

252
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,850
are going to modify that signal to

253
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,279
analog to digital and digital to analog

254
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,649
after date converter the simple

255
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,480
conversion for our PC rate after date

256
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,389
demodulator like we need to demodulate

257
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,029
dead signal based on a frame FSK PSK

258
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,040
both modulation it is using and after

259
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,800
data are using to a modified rate signal

260
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,390
so what are the different hardware and

261
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,240
software available in the market

262
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,910
some of them are fake RF one which is

263
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,160
open source

264
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,270
it works from frequency one megahertz to

265
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,610
sig sig 'his we can easily receive and

266
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,010
transmit signal from it as well is the

267
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,290
RTL HDR which works from frequency one

268
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,689
megahertz to 1.7 gigahertz but we can

269
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,000
only listen to signal from it on the

270
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,370
software side we have chinnu radio the

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,220
GQ arexx in audacity through which we

272
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,040
can modify the signals now humans ooh

273
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,410
can you please tell me this was all

274
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,910
about the hardware devices were why we

275
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,530
need to look about it in what are the

276
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,089
different things available over there

277
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,600
but how you three persons

278
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,460
how should I plan my attack like what

279
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,730
does our device to in normal operation

280
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:11,450
how do they connect and determining the

281
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:16,400
frequency how can I s in plan my attack

282
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:18,740
so actually and to do that we need to do

283
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,930
the initial profiling for our device and

284
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,150
these are the three questions that every

285
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,000
user should ask whenever there they

286
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,890
start analyzing these devices okay so

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,540
the first question like what you asked

288
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,260
like what does our device do in normal

289
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,170
operation so we need to take a look at

290
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,780
all the components there is a receiving

291
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,479
station which sets off alarm based on

292
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,189
opening doors for example motion from a

293
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,650
motion sensor and pressing of a doorbell

294
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,300
okay so this is not like the normal

295
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,030
operation so we need to understand that

296
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,640
then we need to understand how they do

297
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,160
they communicate how they connect okay

298
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,199
so all of the devices these devices are

299
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,420
connected to each other wire wireless

300
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,580
medium they are not connected to any

301
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,979
sort of local network more like wires

302
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,590
and all so they are all communicating in

303
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,060
an unknown frequency this is important

304
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,180
to note because we need to determine

305
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,890
that before we start hacking them yeah

306
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,870
and the third question which you have

307
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,330
asked is like how we can determine the

308
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,900
frequency so this is very important like

309
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:23,750
we can do it like very easily by able to

310
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,390
replay the functionality when initiating

311
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,510
the actions within ourselves like using

312
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:32,240
hack RF like but what else is going on

313
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:34,100
with the radio transmissions that is in

314
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,560
order to monitor the transmissions in a

315
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,020
very simple way we can use some tools

316
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,180
like GQ rx so as you told

317
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,460
the frequencies frequency might be

318
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,319
anything yes how will I get to note it

319
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,210
okay from a frequency of 1 mega has to

320
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,950
see there it is the frequency on which

321
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,960
my device is working what are the

322
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,200
initial steps I need to take care of

323
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,230
yeah so further like there are different

324
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,510
phases of radio frequency attacks so we

325
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,880
need to first understand that like for

326
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,250
information gathering you can see like

327
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,890
it is a good starting point like if you

328
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,080
have some look always search for the FCC

329
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,540
ID that you can find it on the website

330
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,850
like FCC ID dot IO and there are other

331
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,400
website also if you can extract that

332
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:19,070
information you you can also find some

333
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,380
of the internal images external images

334
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,600
user manuals test results for wireless

335
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,280
devices so you don't need to go to any

336
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,960
other place or you you don't even need

337
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,810
to break your device in order to get

338
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,540
that information ok so that is the first

339
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,290
thing then another important thing is

340
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:38,270
frequency so frequency actually it is

341
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,329
the number of occurrences of a repeating

342
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,760
event per unit of time so we what we

343
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:46,430
need to imp know here is it is a fast

344
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,090
Fourier transformation algorithm that

345
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,969
computes that discrete DFT that is

346
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,500
discrete Fourier transform of a sequence

347
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,660
so we need to understand that particular

348
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,850
algorithm how actually that works and

349
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,699
how it converts a signal from its

350
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,890
original domain like often time or space

351
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,600
whatever you take into account to a

352
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,350
representation in the frequency domain

353
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,260
and vice-versa then third thing is the

354
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:15,200
modulation so modulation is like hiding

355
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:18,470
a code inside a courier wave so you will

356
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,960
see a like sine wave cos wave there are

357
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,580
different kind of waves right so you

358
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,950
need to see what are the codes that are

359
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,080
hidden inside that wave and also like

360
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,930
representing digital data as variations

361
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,200
in the carrier wave then there is the

362
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,120
fourth one is the transmission so

363
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,280
transmission is nothing but it generates

364
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,170
the message from above extracted details

365
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,290
so whatever we have performed from these

366
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,729
past these three steps that will be we

367
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,939
are going to use in the transmission

368
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,390
phase so hash it my question to you is

369
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,010
like okay so we already know about these

370
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,980
four phases so can

371
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,200
give one good example where we can use

372
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,920
these IOT components in any of the field

373
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,900
yeah

374
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,270
so let's take an example of aviation why

375
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,880
not like cars are turning into computers

376
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,579
on wheels and airplanes have been flying

377
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,350
data centers now but this increase in

378
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,480
power in connectivity has largely

379
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,510
happened without designing in inadequate

380
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,880
security protocols IOT can improve

381
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,250
multiple aspects of an airport such as

382
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,140
by regulating traffic flow then helping

383
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,870
passengers navigate using Wi-Fi beacons

384
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,790
NFC takes and geolocation is

385
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,460
streamlining security checkpoints with

386
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,650
biometrics like facial recognition in

387
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,200
reducing the number of lost brakes using

388
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,750
electronic luggage takes in sensors and

389
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,400
more so here we can see there are so

390
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,530
many different attack vectors being

391
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,959
possible when we talk about the aviation

392
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,300
there's comes in air traffic control

393
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,370
there comes the infrastructure in the

394
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,589
fire alarm sign sensors there comes how

395
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,720
we are taking our care of the our Vegas

396
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,040
then there are so many different attack

397
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,250
vectors being possible at the aviation

398
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,709
itself so human sir can you please

399
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,470
explain what is the simplest way to get

400
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,870
in to take in any honey III ot device

401
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,910
yeah so we would like to just show you

402
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,890
one demo maybe that will be a good thing

403
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:12,530
it's a simple demo so what is happening

404
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,960
here is like her sheath has recorded the

405
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:17,629
signal okay we we recorded the

406
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,069
lock/unlock signal of the car that that

407
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,150
with this this is the first explained

408
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:26,230
that we tried on our car and what he is

409
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,120
going to do is like he is going to play

410
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,030
perform replay attack okay so you can

411
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,879
see he has already captured the signal

412
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:41,420
oh can you see that no no it's not

413
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,100
Mexican about it okay okay so yeah so no

414
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,520
problem so what we did is like we

415
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,409
captured the frequency and the same

416
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,840
frequency we perform using hacker of

417
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,110
device we transmitted the same frequency

418
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:57,260
to lock or unlock the car okay so you

419
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,199
can see here the Skip name like a heck

420
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,540
RF transfer and then you this is minus R

421
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,670
and then the file name to read the file

422
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,629
name and then the file which on which

423
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,760
the frequency will be

424
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,770
transmitted so this is the one thing and

425
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,430
what is the advantage of this replay

426
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,720
attack so advantage first advantage is

427
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,090
you don't need to have any knowledge

428
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,920
because when we started using the hacker

429
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,990
of device we actually don't know have

430
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,490
any idea about the frequency we just

431
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,200
need to capture the frequency on which

432
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,450
the car is getting logged and unlocked

433
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,940
and then there will is like effective

434
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,770
even if the message is encrypted

435
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,870
sometimes you just need to replicate and

436
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,120
even it works because there might not be

437
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,520
proper authentication mechanisms and all

438
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,620
those coming into picture for some old

439
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,200
cars now now some smart cuz they do

440
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,959
implement these techniques then there

441
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,700
are also some disadvantages like we

442
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,700
cannot create a valid message from

443
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,680
scratch we need to record it and then we

444
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,290
can modify using some tools that is

445
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,850
possible and another one is like we

446
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,350
cannot play with messages like many

447
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,330
times you would like to modify message

448
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,280
based on the original one sometimes it

449
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,199
doesn't allow you to modify because

450
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,510
they've might be adding some noise or it

451
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,240
might be encrypted we don't we cannot

452
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:13,160
decrypt them so that time like you will

453
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,500
be like this cracking your head like why

454
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,300
I am NOT able to decrypt it so those

455
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,730
kind of mechanisms if they used you

456
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,100
cannot modify then you can tamper with

457
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,630
ID and command then those things are

458
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,120
very simple that hash it is going to

459
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,760
tell you in next presentation next

460
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,350
flight so and then perform input

461
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,060
validation attacks because there are

462
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,100
still some input validation attacks

463
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,919
which cannot be performed this is the

464
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,929
one of the disadvantage of this so when

465
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,330
we talk about the reply Tex we can see

466
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,040
early she that if that frequency is

467
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,290
changing if suppose the data is being

468
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,870
not always the same then reflect will

469
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,450
note work so how can we do it let us

470
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,850
understand first with an analogy with of

471
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,860
comparison with wired in wireless when

472
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,320
we talk about wired protocols Suites

473
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,750
based on voltage timing in wiring

474
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,370
defining Swanston zeros but when we talk

475
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,490
about wireless it's same pattern of

476
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,229
energy here energy I if you can see the

477
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,110
different frequency is being transmitted

478
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,390
online spectrum it's a violation about

479
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,889
two and 107 megahertz so data is being

480
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,200
transmitted over there and we can see

481
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,900
the energy patterns so our radio

482
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,610
spectrum works on a physical layer now

483
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,429
let's check how can we do the

484
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,020
signal hunting how can i how will i

485
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,540
capture and record the signal analyze

486
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,970
demodulate in decode so the first step

487
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,620
in identifying a radio signal is to

488
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,270
determine the operating frequency of the

489
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,830
transmitter on which frequency the

490
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,720
transmitter six frequencies being

491
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,240
broadcasted other than industrial

492
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,190
scientific or medical means the radio

493
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,679
spectrum is a tightly managed resource

494
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,750
when we are trying to determine what

495
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,250
type of signal we are seeing we need to

496
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,309
first identify the operating frequency

497
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,290
the simple technology is to look at the

498
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,790
total width of the signal and then find

499
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,070
the midpoint of the signal which will

500
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,690
tell you its bend width in general this

501
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,990
will indicate the operating frequency

502
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,790
with this first piece of information we

503
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,590
can now research frequency assignment

504
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,418
tables to determine what type of radio

505
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,000
services may be assigned to this

506
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:10,490
specific frequency now there comes the

507
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,770
second step of inch information that is

508
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,870
very important how wide int signal is

509
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,970
dead zone on the spectrum display the

510
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,159
width or occupied bandwidth of the

511
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,460
signal providers additional information

512
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,440
in regards like suppose we know for

513
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,520
example that in the case of 2.4

514
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,179
gigahertz is mbend

515
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,580
bluetooth and Wi-Fi both works but w of

516
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,100
frequency bandwidth of bluetooth is only

517
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,470
approximately 2 1 megahertz way but

518
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,959
while Wi-Fi frequency signal could be up

519
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,910
to 40 megahertz wide in summary the

520
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,530
basic spectrum display allow us to

521
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,090
determine the frequency occupied

522
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:46,010
bandwidth and relativist range for a

523
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,320
radio transmitter so this is how we can

524
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,250
determine the frequency after date how

525
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,409
is it done

526
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,660
so when you find a signal of interest

527
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,130
whether this is signal dead suit or

528
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,650
should not be present in a particular

529
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:00,169
frequency band you would want to start

530
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,940
with the basics the first step is to

531
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:04,370
look at the frequency bandwidth in a

532
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:06,320
shape of a signal of interest to get an

533
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,168
idea about the characteristics and

534
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,540
therefore to identify the signal so for

535
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:14,330
example many of the 3G and 4G signal

536
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,970
help square tops due to the type of

537
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:19,399
filtering they use also this commercial

538
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,799
wireless signal use predictable wind

539
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,230
with you can make an educated guess on

540
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,090
the signal type based on what you see on

541
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:29,390
the screen like what is fate on whether

542
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,370
it's a sk f sk or p sk based on date

543
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,750
also you can determine as well as the

544
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,489
second step is to

545
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,950
but for modulation analysis of the

546
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,050
signal analyzing the modulation will

547
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,250
give further insight into what more of

548
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,830
the unique characteristics of that

549
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:44,690
signal the third step is to capture the

550
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,149
signal data in perform additional

551
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,920
analysis on that signal this can with

552
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,780
difficult technique because based on

553
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,320
some experienced trial and error we can

554
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,660
only do it when we talk about this you

555
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,220
could look at the RF IQ simple versus

556
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,860
time like how is it the modulation

557
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,110
changing what is its sample rate or look

558
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,810
at the spectrogram to find the ofdm

559
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,219
subcarriers if there's any so even so

560
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,810
can you please brief what are the

561
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,950
different attack RF attics which can get

562
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,649
so Hirsch's actually there are many

563
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,140
different types of RF attacks but we can

564
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,610
we we did not list all type of attacks

565
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,630
because you can always go and refer them

566
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:27,050
so first one is like sniffing which is

567
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,640
very common so when when we begin with

568
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,919
sniffing the massive observation of

569
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,870
wireless network traffic the sniffing is

570
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,090
noteworthy because the wireless domain

571
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,979
enables truly promise cos sniffing this

572
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,740
is important to note because you don't

573
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,300
require any direct physical access so

574
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,460
and the method of attack can be a

575
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,919
sniffing can be performed by using a

576
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,230
radio receiver to passively receive

577
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,210
wireless network traffic and the impact

578
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,010
can be anything like data loss device

579
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,470
network discovery all those things and

580
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,180
then there is another attack which is

581
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,990
very common which is wardriving

582
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,580
and it is a type of sniffing only but

583
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,750
that refers to the act of searching for

584
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,399
wireless networks or devices and you can

585
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,710
see like with the growth of mobile and

586
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,790
iot protocols were driving now refers to

587
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,730
discovering none 802.11 RF networks as

588
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:18,440
well so there there is a different

589
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,660
method of attack for this also like it

590
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,410
can be either performed passive or

591
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,480
active and the potential in impact can

592
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,060
be the discovery of devices and networks

593
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,740
identifying exploitable devices then

594
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,320
there is an evil train attack which is

595
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,230
known by everyone like there is an able

596
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,450
to n attack for Wi-Fi and other so

597
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,679
attackers are using even pineapple

598
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:44,330
devices and the method can be like the

599
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,520
attacker must first capture the defining

600
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,530
metadata of the infrastructure

601
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,300
he needs to be mimicked and this may

602
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,250
include RF channel information and

603
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,720
addressing information like MAC

604
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,940
addresses and societies for 802.11 so

605
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,980
the potential impact can be the

606
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,050
eavesdropping and tampering with with

607
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,390
network traffic even data loss and

608
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,360
tracking of some of the devices then the

609
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:11,480
replay attack which we already discussed

610
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,070
earlier and the potential impact of the

611
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,720
replay attack can be the change the

612
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,000
state of a network or induce the

613
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,700
behavior by a device on a network then

614
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,950
jamming jamming is like very frequently

615
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,130
used by attackers nowadays it is perhaps

616
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,410
the most well known attack on wireless

617
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,420
systems since the radio frequency domain

618
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:32,240
can be thought of a bus that all

619
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,309
wireless systems share loading it up and

620
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,340
powerful wide band noise or spurious

621
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,620
traffic is an effective way of denying a

622
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,389
communication channel right so the

623
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,610
method of attack can be like in the

624
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,090
simplest form it can be conducted by

625
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,919
transforming a sorry transmitting noise

626
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:51,199
within the target of the network's RF

627
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,080
channel that is the same frequency and

628
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,870
with same with sufficient bandwidth and

629
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,000
power so the potential impact can be

630
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,070
like denying legitimate network traffic

631
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,530
and disrupting the network state which

632
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:06,080
it is falling in characteristic current

633
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,760
state so hazard can you just explain

634
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,230
more about the Internet of Radio

635
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,990
varieties that they should be aware

636
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,540
about so first thing is we often hear

637
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:16,220
about the dangers of dark wave but when

638
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,740
we talk about the Internet of radio it's

639
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,690
not merely dark but it's invisible we

640
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,550
just have a radio spectrum we need to

641
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,160
determine what is being transmitted at

642
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:28,280
what frequency so the current state of

643
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,250
IOT devices is same like the wave

644
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:35,059
security bacon 20s so that is the first

645
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,130
thing the internet of radio so the rogue

646
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:39,020
Rob you shell towers we can always

647
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,270
create the roguish shell towers and you

648
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,059
can just capture all of your other radio

649
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,559
frequencies and then listen to the voter

650
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,820
what is being transmitted on the

651
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,320
two-factor authentication

652
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,970
what is being transmitted on date

653
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,159
frequency as well as Rob your Wi-Fi

654
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,050
hotspot like the MIT M attacks through

655
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,990
Wi-Fi pineapple then comes the

656
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,790
unapproved IOT emitter you need to look

657
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,500
out what are the different emitters in

658
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,350
my

659
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,390
frequency range and in my organization

660
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,520
whether I have allowed it frequency to

661
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,350
be used or note so that is one thing

662
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,870
then eavesdropping or surveillance as

663
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,760
devices like the FM and GSM or other

664
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,209
radio books which are being used over

665
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,190
there

666
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,650
vulnerable violation devices like

667
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,330
low-end keyboards or Mouse dongle which

668
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,370
can be explode to RF attics

669
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,100
these are the some of the different

670
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,350
possibilities as well as vote if someone

671
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,659
turns off thermostat in cold climate for

672
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,429
extended period the water pipes in house

673
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,980
can fridge and that can be brushed it

674
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:35,440
this well is the door locks thermostats

675
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,270
like motion detectors wireless control

676
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,160
lights these are all over level two

677
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,160
radio because they are transmitting on

678
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,350
the radio spectrum bulk can be displayed

679
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,270
by thermal stress if old bulbs are

680
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,560
destroyed it will disturb work for some

681
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,020
time so these are some of the

682
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,169
possibilities of radium availabilities

683
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,790
now the most important thing to know

684
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,400
about is the privacy rules and

685
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,920
regulation it is not allowed to transmit

686
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,050
in the flavy signal zone you cannot just

687
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,330
listen to a frequencies you need to know

688
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:07,149
about the FCC in a nightie a regulations

689
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,040
of your country so always check then s

690
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,020
in amateur a station must use the

691
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,000
minimum transistors transmitter power

692
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,650
necessary to carry out the desired

693
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,420
communication you need to check out for

694
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,760
the FCC regulation of your country a

695
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,650
civil is no each station may transmit

696
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,200
with a power transmitter power the

697
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,370
exiting 1.5 kilowatt whenever you are

698
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,070
doing any kind of research

699
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:29,350
please keep note of this so under

700
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,659
another important point I would like to

701
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,639
add is like in different countries there

702
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,860
are different laws so we need to follow

703
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,440
that because most of the government's

704
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,899
does not allow us to transmit any signal

705
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,670
because there might be other devices

706
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,940
deployed on the same frequency level and

707
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,640
we should not be the intruder who should

708
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,710
be we are ok it's ok to capture the

709
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,330
signals it's ok to read the signals

710
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,210
because they are allowing it but it's

711
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:57,340
not ok to replay a perform replay kind

712
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,250
of attacks or retransmitted a similar

713
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,409
signals ok it might cause disruptions to

714
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:05,170
other frequencies that are transmitting

715
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,850
and another important thing is like the

716
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:09,190
steps for compliance for IT

717
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,600
organizations we need to be aware like

718
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,210
what data we are collecting and

719
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,360
processing because with GDP are coming

720
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,070
in

721
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,469
to picture we need to take the consent

722
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,928
of the user or company whether you can

723
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,549
really store that particular data and

724
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:24,070
understand the functionality and

725
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:26,650
implement consent so this is again

726
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,939
another important point then we need to

727
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,010
record everything to make the

728
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,080
requirements of Privacy Act because as

729
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,299
we told it differs from reason to reason

730
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,669
country to country so we need to read

731
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:38,500
them properly and if required we can

732
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,130
hire a lawyer and then be aware of the

733
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:45,220
policy that is by design and default and

734
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,960
so walkthrough of what we covered we

735
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,030
talked about the different RF devices

736
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,460
what are the different hardware software

737
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,780
available how the free on what

738
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,610
frequencies what data is being

739
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,129
transmitted on what frequency which is

740
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:59,229
allocated to which devices how can we do

741
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,030
what are the different phases it is

742
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,679
Edward a advice to analyze the

743
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,570
transmitter then receiver

744
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,640
reverse-engineer them so we have looked

745
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,740
at what wise the IOT market is changing

746
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,559
how is it changing and what are the

747
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,090
different radio vulnerabilities so now

748
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:20,629
let's secure the RF world thank you

749
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,629
[Applause]

750
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,530
you
