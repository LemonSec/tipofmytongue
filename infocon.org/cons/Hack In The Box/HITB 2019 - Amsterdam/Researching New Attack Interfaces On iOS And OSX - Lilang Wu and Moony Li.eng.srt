1
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:34,940
hello everyone today my topic is fresh

2
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:40,190
Anto researching new items interface RS

3
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:43,190
and necklace this is the agenda of our

4
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,500
topic we were first introduced the

5
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,480
overview of our solution then we were

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,489
details how to automatically generate

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,760
the tank interface through static and

8
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:58,550
dynamic analysis what's more we will

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,730
also introduce our deep authority to

10
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,929
find the newly attack service when

11
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:10,220
system update funnily we will talk about

12
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:16,340
the automatic fuzzing solution and one

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:20,899
abilities we found my name is lee

14
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,289
dongwoo and i have four years of

15
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:29,720
securing appearance and is a member of

16
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:34,070
our advanced Railway 3000 I CRO and now

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,950
folks Mecca is ours won a bid he

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:42,889
discovery and more hunting and ladies

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:45,170
morning me money we have about nine

20
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,350
years security clearance men mainly

21
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,229
focus on the mic and androids 1 billion

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:56,059
hunt and exploit and also I have

23
00:01:51,229 --> 00:02:03,229
developed some cans of sandbox and

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:08,590
products now let's talk about our autumn

25
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:11,510
Intifada solution our solution has three

26
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:15,370
main components including automatic

27
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:20,048
static rewards the rewards are nearing

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:23,420
dynamic analysis and fuzzy solution Modi

29
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:27,109
static rewarding an earring is responder

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,119
for NOS omnes man a tank service in

31
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:33,920
colonel and connect station

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,070
automatically an outfit on into a victor

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,839
dynamic analysis will make up and

34
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:43,709
profile this newly

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,470
a tank at service vector funnily this

36
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:49,470
tank sir is we are input into our

37
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:54,840
passive fuzzing tool in order to find

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,540
the potential vulnerabilities now I will

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,930
introduce how to analyze the kernel and

40
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,640
connotation attack interfaces statically

41
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:10,230
and automatically sync by in the wall I

42
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,410
think the factory military base big city

43
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:17,940
or other critical places may be the most

44
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,850
possible for enemy to attack so for our

45
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,549
system there are also many critical

46
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:29,430
places where which may be wonder about

47
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:33,450
such as FPC so is mixing some kernel and

48
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,370
connotations traditionally for example

49
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,709
you know connotations

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,099
we should manually analyze the critical

51
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:44,100
functions using error or other rewarding

52
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:48,899
tools to get the petitioner interfaces

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:53,959
its trio and time-consuming so next we

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,959
will introduce automatic analysis Messer

55
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,519
listening girl shows our rewards

56
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,040
aeryn aeryn solution first we will

57
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:06,000
analyze the kernel and connotation to

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,108
get or the attack interfaces from newly

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,019
released region and generate user kind

60
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:18,060
victor external missile interfaces with

61
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:20,639
her and so on the second step is to give

62
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,030
the X in your projects and cannot

63
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,330
accessions between two neighboring

64
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:30,479
regions which can kill the update

65
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:34,139
functions and release the sub step is to

66
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,669
fit out those ensure function and show

67
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:41,820
functions which cannot assess - from

68
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:44,630
user space and serve those remaining and

69
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,550
last week we were cleared those

70
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,840
remaining interfaces and the cells are

71
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,840
into our phasing cross

72
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,080
next we will introduce the kernel

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,740
iteration interfaces vector automatic

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,219
generation

75
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:06,190
general solution it may include it may

76
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,900
introduce four steps we first analyze

77
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:14,170
all the towers and get or casas

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:19,150
heritance inheritance relationship then

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:23,580
refund method names based on inherit

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:27,580
mechanism so that we automatically

81
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:31,539
analyze user kinds in each excisions and

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,789
their connection type finally we all

83
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,490
know that the there are many internal

84
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:42,610
method for each user crying so we will

85
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:46,560
look at them and possibility content in

86
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:51,970
the alkyd mechanism OS miracast function

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,370
message run for many runtime type type

88
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:00,040
information for live kernel and our kids

89
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:02,880
our kids Casas it is : and the boundary

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:08,710
layer with four instead of three

91
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,650
parameters the first one contains a

92
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,130
pointer to the main hard class which

93
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,210
will be constructed the second one is

94
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,500
this name

95
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:23,250
the third one is his parent Marika's

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:27,010
instance and the first one is his site

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,130
so service function we can find all

98
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:36,580
classes in Curzon's

99
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:40,450
reiationship and we all know that screen

100
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:44,830
symbol three symbols was a stripped in

101
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:49,060
release region from where I was ever

102
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,640
firmware so it will refine the it should

103
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,800
refine the messer names for each OS

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:07:01,360
object class classes including instant

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,410
message Evo and meta method table

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:13,360
throw the inherit mechanism many Messer

107
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:17,590
name can be refund from its parents and

108
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,490
for user kind analysis the key function

109
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:24,239
is also is near the current function

110
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:28,360
this function is pump of correct

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:33,220
connection for non Connell kind based on

112
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,220
certain high right finger shows graphic

113
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,400
graphic of seller return new user kind

114
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:47,110
function which hand we found refined

115
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:49,719
some streams our I owe user kind is also

116
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:51,550
a subclass of our service which price

117
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,750
are passive for communication between

118
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:59,050
kind applications and our kid objects

119
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:02,650
this finger shows process how to a cure

120
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,800
an external method and all the external

121
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:09,460
measures are implemented in these

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:13,000
functions so for researchers it is

123
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:18,909
necessary to analyze this function to

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,349
get the drawers external misses after

125
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:27,610
because analysis flow and NASA's points

126
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:30,969
all we need to do is to implement the

127
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:35,080
automation process and killed erratic

128
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:37,180
attack so is quicker for example we

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,180
should get this kind of connection hi

130
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:45,120
yellow kind to bow for your kind or

131
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:48,189
nurses for as shown in a bow finger and

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,300
external messages per table like below

133
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:58,270
finger shows for example for external

134
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:00,719
Mesa analysis for case on cue ball the

135
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,420
automation historic and the foreign

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,260
first we shall look look at the new user

137
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:12,819
client function of jazz in each tower

138
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:15,610
next we should analyze assembly

139
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:20,610
instruction to enumerate the connection

140
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:24,000
types other and corresponding user kind

141
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,740
generally the initialize the

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,870
initialization of each user kind

143
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,970
corresponding to different types is

144
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:37,709
controlled by if closed Oh switch closed

145
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:41,170
when it has multi connection types so

146
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:46,630
assembly instructions analysis is must

147
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:50,349
for external measures generate some

148
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:53,019
subsidies we are define it in the

149
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:57,880
economics over I function and that is

150
00:09:53,019 --> 00:10:02,440
fed table than array is a steady steady

151
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:06,820
local or global concern array if sub

152
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,700
sorry if subsidies not override external

153
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,540
method in function it will be defined in

154
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,860
the care target and method for index or

155
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:21,339
quatre cinq target and messes or index

156
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,490
function and the dispatch structure will

157
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:27,339
be also little different even though

158
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:34,720
anyway this to implementation is

159
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:34,960
gracefully which can easy to analyze for

160
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
this

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,120
graceful implementation we can possibly

162
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,720
look at the study and Jess of each

163
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,000
constant array in symbol table and then

164
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,140
past the content according to this cut

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,090
this to kind of structure so the

166
00:10:50,140 --> 00:11:00,580
important is to how to look at a dress

167
00:10:52,090 --> 00:11:03,730
of this concern early however not all

168
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,850
towers use and press for implementation

169
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,760
actually most of them use sweet costs or

170
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,810
if close to control the occlusion or X

171
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,090
no messes so it will be the same

172
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,150
separation with a new user kind function

173
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:25,270
analysis with those need to analyze

174
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:28,030
assembly instructions next we will

175
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:31,449
introduce how to locate the addresses of

176
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:35,110
key local on the global concern Audrey

177
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:40,480
firstly and then introduce our assembly

178
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:43,630
instruction on narcissus Messrs actually

179
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,690
the symbols of local and global constant

180
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,120
arrays are saved into symbol table

181
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:57,070
section so we can search those symbols

182
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:59,950
which started with an Zi and Zi and Zi

183
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:04,120
Zi and Zi and for example the finger

184
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:07,240
below shows the reason those ow

185
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,070
friend powerful user kind and our hid

186
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,450
user kind so it will be easy for us to

187
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:18,800
carry kind of external measure

188
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:22,820
dispatches automatically hi

189
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,430
for assembly instruction analysis de

190
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:30,980
jambe some reverse engineering framework

191
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:35,209
available such an anger and museum this

192
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:39,200
kind of frameworks but this december a

193
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:43,518
binary code construction assembly CFG

194
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:47,600
and in emulate emulates instructor

195
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,769
occlusion using GI t but it also how

196
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,589
many disadvantages such an illness to

197
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:58,670
multi code into virtual memory in order

198
00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:03,529
to in order to keep one function was

199
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:08,149
mostly due to the complexity operating

200
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:10,519
system what's more for getting an

201
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:13,130
externality spare table and mention

202
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,490
about it is difficult for it is

203
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,110
difficult to construct different

204
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,750
conditions automatically to support all

205
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,320
the passes

206
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,310
however if not use this binary analysis

207
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,209
framework we should construct

208
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:34,219
instruction simulator by ourselves and

209
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:39,279
construct a kernel analysis agent which

210
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:44,959
used to analyze Metro film and implement

211
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:48,470
virtual memory operation we think about

212
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,829
what we want we only want to pass the

213
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,680
connection type and the oscillator in

214
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:58,969
the if condition clause or switch cares

215
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:02,089
close and can't get a corresponding of a

216
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:05,060
kind or external measures so we do not

217
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:09,320
need to simulator all those instructions

218
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:12,649
operation we can only assimilate those

219
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,380
instructions within if closed or case

220
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:19,760
closed and only care about is certainly

221
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,820
registered there are flow therefore we

222
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,990
can customer a kernel extension analysis

223
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,949
agent

224
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:32,870
use anger or museum to generate CFG or

225
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:35,270
CG and customer instruction emulator

226
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:41,720
which can eventually have us to generate

227
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:44,510
a tank service automatically now we will

228
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,790
show show you our frontiers about how to

229
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:53,650
customer kernel extension analysis agent

230
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:56,930
our nurse's agent including import

231
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:59,900
employment metro film parser handler

232
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:05,750
which could pass key sections and

233
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:08,540
segments improvement voucher address and

234
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:16,910
the film of the dress operation and also

235
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:19,990
implements memory operation here is our

236
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,939
implementation the first the first three

237
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,120
functions are used to search the Warshaw

238
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:30,350
and film address for each segment and

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:33,140
section next functions are used to get

240
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,860
memory content or stream for a given

241
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:39,439
address the falling to function

242
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,770
implements the switch from each other

243
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,770
for water OGS and the film and address

244
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,830
this class is a rebuttable for mapper

245
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,710
met metro film into a class and pass all

246
00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:01,300
sections information in order to proud

247
00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:04,100
basic information for our agent actually

248
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,589
there have already some nice kind of

249
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,290
open source libraries and our analysis

250
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,290
agent is also implement persona

251
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:18,380
last we defined as met our class than

252
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,250
you to save all the detail informations

253
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:26,180
when online each user client and

254
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:29,450
external measures here we can see that

255
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:34,370
we save the details information about

256
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:37,250
another unwise Cassie's the address of

257
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,750
many key functions and the whether it

258
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:44,480
can whether each is can be connected

259
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,490
from user space and is connection type

260
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,200
is yes

261
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,330
in other words you can search any

262
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:56,980
details information from list counts

263
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:56,980
after each Medicus analysis finished

264
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:07,130
false CFG generation we use menial ISM

265
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:12,170
list or is open source and it has his

266
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:17,750
own usage usage document so here we were

267
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:20,750
not introduced here again this is

268
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:27,260
running example the new user kind

269
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:30,590
function of fo h I hid aging classes it

270
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,200
has three connection types after

271
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:37,280
analysis vision can construct the

272
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:43,430
control over full control flow graph and

273
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:45,139
right finger sure I mentioned before we

274
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,960
can only care about the certain

275
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:55,130
registers that have flowed English

276
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:57,980
example is 14 T register actually this

277
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,410
researcher this register is point to the

278
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,890
connection type register which which is

279
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:09,850
the first parameter of New York I

280
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:15,440
function for external measure is a same

281
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:18,050
after case this branch using CFG all we

282
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,230
need to do is to analyze them together

283
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:25,810
ready related user user client

284
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,810
information or extraneous information

285
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:32,389
next we will introduce our customer

286
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:36,710
instruction emulator in reputation for

287
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:41,470
an online each branch I mentioned before

288
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:45,650
we only own eyes those key functions

289
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,830
therefore it will be contains a small

290
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:53,270
part of instructions we need to we need

291
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:57,230
to emulate it so it will reduce the

292
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,850
difficulty and complexity

293
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:06,029
he released some instructionally

294
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:12,559
immunity saturn's adip at platform

295
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:20,929
platform and le mo Co instructions for

296
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:24,658
x64 pencil these two pictures shows

297
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:27,830
register operation emulation such an

298
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:33,080
skilled immediate immediately when you

299
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,080
offset register name from instructions

300
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:42,690
originally our tour can output analysis

301
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:46,440
without into a database for foreign tour

302
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:49,320
to query this result including the two

303
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,070
balls service name and their car

304
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,740
connection time and this dispatch

305
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,678
servers which contains the selectors and

306
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:05,519
corresponding parameter size and

307
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:11,249
construction next we will introduce the

308
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:14,159
kernel interfaces automatic analysis are

309
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:17,129
due to Colonel Hart is open source so it

310
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,029
will be easier to analyze them than

311
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:23,689
ignition parts we can simply to search

312
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:29,639
these films and possibly related

313
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:33,059
interfaces next we will introduce our

314
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:34,678
interfaces if analysis solution in order

315
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:42,240
to kill the newly change

316
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:45,450
attack attack service for kernel we

317
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,899
firstly pass and give those films we

318
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,409
just mentioned in cost green for getting

319
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:55,729
the newly interfaces this interfaces

320
00:20:52,409 --> 00:21:00,830
include the newly added ones and

321
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:04,379
arguments tint ones alternatively

322
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:07,109
corresponding information can also be

323
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:09,510
care from the kernel binary analysis -

324
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,240
or like Joker

325
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:17,279
secondly with Eve or the film you serve

326
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:21,750
some noise large like unit test films in

327
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:26,700
the actual projects and tag those chains

328
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,159
are newly Eddie's films suddenly maxed

329
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,600
ethics for changed or newly added

330
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:37,169
function names within those films

331
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:39,928
possibly constructed the coding sequence

332
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:43,200
for the changes functions and the case

333
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:48,029
they are ancient functions finally check

334
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,889
these entry functions if the exit in

335
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:56,100
about interface vector and the cells

336
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:58,529
call graphs if yes which are the newly

337
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,279
attack is serviced in Colonel we should

338
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,279
pay attention to

339
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:11,639
we recommend open source we show washer

340
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:16,019
thief and more to mail this finger shows

341
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:19,979
is a this finger below is the thief

342
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:27,809
results we created by melt actually is

343
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:30,360
the Petra of CVE 2018 twenty or forty

344
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:34,620
two for history

345
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:39,510
therefore we customer is deep interface

346
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:42,809
and aided in function name recognization

347
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,669
no do in order to automatic alphas and

348
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:51,149
newly added our change the function

349
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:55,309
names for construct the coding sequence

350
00:22:51,149 --> 00:23:00,689
for for the changed functions we we

351
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:03,779
implement two PT's first era pro allow

352
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:07,320
pro script a good news for us is than

353
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:10,200
the kernel is open source and nearly no

354
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,668
scripts the strings so it is rarely

355
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,980
forced to construct the co graph the

356
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:20,669
right finger is the entry function this

357
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,299
we call from PDF which can touch this

358
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:29,720
which can't at least change the function

359
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:34,220
through use of space but is a little

360
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,249
different connotations are closest so we

361
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:43,789
can use mail to diva sauce

362
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:47,330
soft Kohl films here we develop Rose

363
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,669
script based on PDF clocking we can

364
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,389
easily recognize the similarity between

365
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:59,149
two functions and then using PD to

366
00:23:53,389 --> 00:24:01,178
oppose their entry functions however the

367
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:04,399
ex is some problem in the implementation

368
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:06,679
why is the stream the streams in

369
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:10,100
connotations are heavily stripped and

370
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,980
another is the function cause most

371
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:17,059
complaints using cross obvious pointer

372
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:20,980
has a method of say offset so it's

373
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:24,889
difficult for us to construct CFG and CG

374
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:28,999
therefore there will be multi functions

375
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:35,178
we cannot we cannot analyze so we should

376
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:40,999
using dynamic analysis for us to make

377
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:53,499
have this parts or next that money to

378
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:53,499
introduce that enemy analysis hello

379
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,389
actually we have introduces how to find

380
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,960
this attack interface from the stacked

381
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:05,689
view and the norm wave you get another

382
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,879
view to finding the attacking service

383
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:11,600
from the next new tonight dynamic

384
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:15,498
analysis view so and we have mentioned

385
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,350
before so key methodology for dynamic

386
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:22,009
analysis is to get as a runtime context

387
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:24,408
of tag interfaces API so as to have a

388
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:27,259
trigger fast or even reproduce the

389
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:29,629
petition what ability as our bad

390
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,779
practice we would choose the freedom to

391
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:35,509
control and choose use modal context and

392
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:36,540
a decrease which is embedded the tools

393
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:40,290
macro

394
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:44,780
colonel to chase the colonel convert as

395
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:48,060
a manually affiliation that debugging

396
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,910
where our DB impose the youth mode and

397
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,240
kernel mode is also reasonable so the

398
00:25:50,910 --> 00:26:00,780
colonel Abbas is the basic comparison

399
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:19,730
summary among among all the kind of

400
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:19,730
dynamic analysis tools should be okay

401
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:26,550
nothing introduced freedom openness in

402
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:28,889
user mode hook the freedom may be one of

403
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:31,919
the most popular dynamic instrumentation

404
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:36,180
toolkit on many platforms including some

405
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:40,230
McCoy's and ours or one of the most quo

406
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:42,720
or the advantages you said it lost a lot

407
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,240
of researcher to pick and control every

408
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,240
functions our API is using well

409
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,150
documented in JavaScript API which

410
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,720
including the pre and post you in

411
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:57,930
handling typically so retrieving runtime

412
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,810
information including so call stack back

413
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,390
trees throughout the contest written

414
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:09,690
value and an answer you can define them

415
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:13,140
as you can see from from the graph so

416
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:16,110
left the red side is a freighter

417
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:21,690
controller but which is rather the in a

418
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:25,800
pattern and the selected Pratt is in is

419
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,980
the in sir control the Pratt the most

420
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,220
part is in with the freighter server

421
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:37,880
routines with the route privilege so

422
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:42,960
this frida server can attach any process

423
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,270
of whittier entry dean and also it will

424
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,660
inject the freighter thrower

425
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,690
thought and thought do a leap to any

426
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,590
kind of

427
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:57,960
tugga the protease suicide it can hook

428
00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:01,149
any API or functions with the Grippit of

429
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:06,820
transcript and it it kind of scripts can

430
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:11,649
be delivered from the USB or Wi-Fi or

431
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:16,168
any kind of transaction from the radar

432
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:19,959
controller so you can define your own

433
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:22,840
kind of derivative to hook any cancer

434
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,450
for API call application for examples

435
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:30,549
arcade system cover system network and

436
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:34,450
the sea otter particular RPC connections

437
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:38,500
in the method API for example this is a

438
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:41,159
typical API to communication between two

439
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:45,250
different kinds of processes for example

440
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:48,279
we can hook this API the name is

441
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:51,899
explicit connections message and we can

442
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:56,620
also extract the arguments in the

443
00:28:51,899 --> 00:29:00,518
artifact but the name of a connection

444
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,559
and the value of one six four five the

445
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:05,769
argument the sequence number is zero and

446
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,870
also we can get is a concrete value such

447
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,950
as the connection value the connection

448
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:19,330
name and the connection process ID

449
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:24,639
process name and also titties or hole

450
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:27,908
pictures we have we have got from the

451
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,309
iOS runtime environment using the free

452
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:33,610
freida hook this is a typical scenario

453
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:37,539
when you install or allies profile you

454
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:42,029
from the web browser for example surfer

455
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:46,389
Safari you can install any kind of or

456
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:49,360
profile from the web server and the DS

457
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:53,408
profile can be controlled to control

458
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:57,699
your OS devices for example set observe

459
00:29:53,409 --> 00:30:02,080
with APN or VPN proxy for your OS

460
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:05,320
devices and you can see site

461
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,320
we have also current mind all the cans

462
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,600
are for processes which is related to

463
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,610
our eyes the profile installation

464
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:18,699
process and select Pratt is a mobile

465
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:21,810
with the mobile privilege which is raw

466
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:25,120
privilege and the sir the middle part is

467
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:29,679
also the mobile privilege but it can

468
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,489
directly work with the process so the

469
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,610
profile of profile film and the red part

470
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:39,820
is the alter devices such as the

471
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:42,879
lockdown a demon or launch the demon

472
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:45,730
with which is in the root privilege and

473
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,100
all these kind of processes with

474
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,520
different kind of privilege that can be

475
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,500
hooked

476
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:56,860
our attach the by radar also we have

477
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,500
hooked so inter communication NPI status

478
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:04,179
acts physics and method and we can get

479
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:08,680
so exactly pass and concrete values of

480
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:11,260
the API and we can get is the workflow

481
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:22,150
and the relationship from different kind

482
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:24,970
of processes as you can another kind of

483
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:27,730
dynamic to the knowledge is the D trees

484
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,630
which is embedded into the OS axis

485
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,970
kernel dtc is one of the best trading

486
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,850
design with the high performance and the

487
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:40,660
usability in unix-like system including

488
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:44,230
the OS acts badly DTC is not officially

489
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:47,470
supported on ours real devices so as you

490
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:52,650
can see from the architecture above so

491
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:55,720
DT is implemented insert tea trees

492
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,190
provider in the lower part in the kernel

493
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,020
which supported

494
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:04,420
different kinds of sensors which require

495
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,490
the providers in the kernel such as as

496
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,580
system information we army information

497
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:12,400
and the system core profile under file

498
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:15,360
system and so forth and the inter user

499
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,000
mode it can receive and

500
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,129
and candle for deep freeze file which

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,640
you can define the prey and opposed

502
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:30,450
handling events in this kind of script

503
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:37,130
and also you can get results at random

504
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:40,200
of the duties and if this is a defeat

505
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:42,440
provide multiple probes embodied in the

506
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:48,660
kernel with classified and citizens

507
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,680
interim information and the FB T as DT

508
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,240
and so forth

509
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:59,280
we can which you can see from the graph

510
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:03,120
graphic teaches /al commander the

511
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,629
typical system call including including

512
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,610
so al-kidd match message and the network

513
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:11,790
network and the disk and affair

514
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:19,020
operations are also covered by teaches

515
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:21,270
Probus and what small decrease in the

516
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,530
language in script provide a full

517
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:28,290
vertical api to intercept for italy and

518
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,620
the post events for examples of begin

519
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:35,750
and end keywords related to the runtime

520
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:40,219
process context for example the PID and

521
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:43,290
precise name time tab file name and the

522
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:47,520
section name and so forth and you can

523
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:54,629
see the codes peaches from our eye off

524
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:58,500
our probe for example you can you can

525
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:01,530
get his exam exactly it's a fair

526
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:05,430
operation including the PID each section

527
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:08,460
name and arguments of therapist and so

528
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:11,460
forth but it's a drawback of also a

529
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:15,630
decrease is that it could not it has to

530
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:17,100
come view as exactly of the exaction of

531
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,860
api exaction

532
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,159
but you could not control or moneymoney

533
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:25,700
modify any kind of contact values at

534
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,699
random

535
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:32,159
so indeed prior to review in the next

536
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:35,859
part we will introduce our automatic

537
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:42,549
passing fighting solution here's the

538
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:45,038
here is a whole picture I thought the

539
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:47,288
key methodology of a fatty we would like

540
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:52,299
to touch more exaction pass to the

541
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:54,789
carriage as possible as to to catch the

542
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,478
first part of Colonel crash power

543
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:58,239
fuzzing

544
00:34:55,478 --> 00:35:00,609
so as the first type of fighting is

545
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,309
trying to generate a fruitful corpus

546
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:05,529
about Colonel interface Avia's and

547
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:11,109
caught with Colonel from the Youth

548
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:16,420
Service agent besides besides the blind

549
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:18,578
filings that has a FFR like we recommend

550
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,849
to you to utilize the normal program

551
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:25,150
which would have more chances to

552
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:29,499
interacts with the colonel as the agent

553
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:33,069
for example were you playing some 3d

554
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:36,419
version 3 3 t online games to us the

555
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:40,569
open OpenGL or graphic related drivers

556
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:43,029
and the peripheral devices our operation

557
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:48,549
such as when you connect to the Wi-Fi

558
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:55,900
Bluetooth and many menu amendment ins

559
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:59,559
suicide a lot of real operations was the

560
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:06,279
low low level jurors could be attached

561
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:10,269
to the kernel so what we have done is to

562
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:14,979
do some inline hook to end to the system

563
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:17,229
caused to the checkpoint of of of the

564
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:21,819
Theotokos from the youth mode to kernel

565
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:25,180
mode so typically line hook could

566
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:27,759
include as a allocate that is now

567
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:31,919
connected home address and how can a

568
00:36:27,759 --> 00:36:35,319
sync method and al-qaeda clan tribe

569
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,930
create a mapping my task is the kernel

570
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:42,220
which can

571
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:44,799
copies the user mode the buffer to the

572
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,850
kernel and also we can hook it's a copy

573
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:54,250
IO Reacher is called it directly by the

574
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:57,250
dry runs so wonder when once the data

575
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:00,610
flow is transferred from the user mode

576
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,330
agent to from the Euro models with the

577
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:08,770
kernel in our inline hook point we can

578
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,140
fast and attained the buffers which

579
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:16,060
could be directly controlled by the user

580
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:19,270
mode Barbara so these kind of or taint

581
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,000
into the buffers could be delivered to

582
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,940
the deeper could courage of the kernel

583
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,660
function of the drawing section so that

584
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,510
we have a chance to crash the kernel

585
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:35,649
with our tainted buffer zone and what's

586
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:39,670
more this kind of wood buffer is only

587
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,190
controlled odd or be controlled from the

588
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:45,010
youth modem so we can mix recite they

589
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:49,660
did kind of crash could be reproduced

590
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:57,760
from the user not but not not as blind

591
00:37:49,660 --> 00:38:03,310
of us and also we have introduces the

592
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:06,970
kernel address and either in the memory

593
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:13,750
related operations a society you can

594
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:19,470
catch this operating semantics as a

595
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:25,630
boundary or overflow attacks on the spot

596
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:28,750
for example we have we have we have

597
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:33,640
invited our kernel address Anheuser

598
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:36,220
in the global overflow or hip-hip under

599
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,350
flow or flow UF in mind a double for a

600
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:45,520
type of ray and a small prey on a

601
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:49,120
suicide so if if any kinds of issues is

602
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,900
happened to did kind of for credit issue

603
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:56,440
we can

604
00:38:49,900 --> 00:39:01,450
get is a kernel crash on the spot on the

605
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,040
DC actually kernel address on riser is

606
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,540
one of us the standard the sunrise that

607
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,140
are supported by popular operating

608
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:11,259
operating system including OSX which

609
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,089
have to catch the crash spot so as to

610
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,310
identify the vulnerability root cause

611
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:20,290
and reproducing it to much more easily

612
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:23,560
so what's lucky is that his kids are

613
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:26,050
feature is officially supported inside

614
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,990
your building so you can build up your

615
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:36,880
own accident new kernel like this insert

616
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:40,629
in the left part make SDK root and you

617
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:47,110
can configure the kernel contigs with

618
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:52,410
the key a song keywords and the for our

619
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:55,360
future plan we we can see site set color

620
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:58,480
like fighting in the kernel mode as we

621
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,430
know the runtime environment in the

622
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,150
kernel would be complex there wouldn't

623
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,509
be exciting many environmental variation

624
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,790
in our neutralization for example open

625
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,790
crack the service initializes attacking

626
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:15,880
devices and the sinister character much

627
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,650
mass it ID before one special kernel API

628
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,830
such as I can I'll come either them

629
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:25,420
could work properly so why do not in two

630
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,319
interceptions the kernel API at the

631
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,350
proper time

632
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,870
and the proper state and facet like

633
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:35,220
after all in chronology directly visit

634
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:38,980
are one of the planning to implement as

635
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,259
as where the color fuzzy you know in

636
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,980
kernel mode and the see other part is

637
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,570
about the porting Chris on all key key

638
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:53,680
memory centralizer

639
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:58,240
for closed source Travers so because so

640
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:01,359
efficiently Chrissa mechanism is is

641
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,509
supported by the axle and you kernel

642
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,820
with E is open sourced

643
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:10,359
review modifies the South code of accent

644
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:14,170
yo to catch all kinds of a memory

645
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:18,160
allocation for examples the K memory

646
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:22,690
Mellark free and any kind of memory

647
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,470
reference are the reference so maybe we

648
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:31,960
could also port indeed kind of a memory

649
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:36,910
address and either - so who's a close

650
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:41,200
sauce jurors so we can extend our scope

651
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:44,170
of fuzzy okay at the add value

652
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:51,250
introduces a 0 D 1 B list we have fund

653
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:55,650
by our fasting solutions now let me

654
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,650
introduce one in pcs we found before

655
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:02,710
this is one one RVT we found em

656
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,320
different before our list our is you to

657
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:10,240
process the graphic data and can be

658
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:12,780
assessed to by windows so process the

659
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,390
one ability the one durable function is

660
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,960
est get big sale information measure

661
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:23,319
which is wow the i/o frame buffer user

662
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:28,240
kind external measures and the sector is

663
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,930
one the method takes three scalar impost

664
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,629
data which are this gives display

665
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:41,580
display mode tips and a picture and

666
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,580
return the PCEHR information you the end

667
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,649
this is the depart in formation around

668
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:56,520
the crash point and found on the

669
00:42:50,650 --> 00:43:00,310
register or I di is very big value

670
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,950
however before the card point this

671
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:05,230

672
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:10,259
boundary in the if clause which

673
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,260
restricted no bigger than two

674
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:21,559
but the 100 point is and it transfers

675
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:25,589
heat transfer unsigned into a sign

676
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:29,400
signings before check so we can set the

677
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:33,269
highest of highest veto unsigned into

678
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,730
one and transfer it to a sign value

679
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:39,720
which will be a negative so it can

680
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:44,579
bypass this check in the graph in the

681
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:47,848
crash point we can see that due to RTI

682
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,630
resistor is where is a big value so I

683
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:55,079
see X reaches her past Hardy I would

684
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:59,700
player reaches her Maui at will be a you

685
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:06,000
managed at address so into a cosa page

686
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:08,970
default arrow however if we craft a good

687
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,579
value maybe we can use a foreign string

688
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:20,808
copy function to lick some cano

689
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:27,420

AMD Raiden acts of 4000 Java and the

694
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:43,980
class is you to process the graph

function except struggling impalpable

703
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:22,470

704
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,000
multi checks within this function if

705
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,700
anyone

706
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,510
it is null check probably it may be

707
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:33,330
without one durability and indeed we

708
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:39,110
found another 1 billion dysfunction and

709
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:44,190
already somewhat to have hope in this

710
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:49,050
vulnerability as shown in about finger

711
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:52,080
though the register of our ax is the is

712
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:55,380
in you know place a is the address of

713
00:45:52,080 --> 00:46:01,080
the buffer which create from our medic

714
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:04,950
function our 15 register is in the in

715
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,230
place P is point to the structure import

716
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:12,060
buffer we mentioned before which can

717
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:21,300
control by the mode and easy X which is

718
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:23,870
her is equal to 15 - plus 0 X F at which

719
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:29,010
point to value offsets

720
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:34,529
62 T wall from structure input from

721
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:39,270
place C and press F we can see that it

722
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:41,670
actually used to control the it actually

723
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:44,970
used to control the total copy times

724
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:51,030
from structure buffer content to our

725
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:55,709
malach buffer and from press t and press

726
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:59,400
e we can see that at the X register is

727
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:07,740
used to control the copy size for each

728
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:10,920
copy press tree is is the copy operation

729
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:16,020
which copy can pull content from

730
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:19,620
structure input to our log buffer so

731
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:25,410
obviously as the x value is scared from

732
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:30,120
user space in fast speed and how how no

733
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:36,319
any change X therefore an outer boundary

734
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:36,319
rate will be handy if it is bigger value

735
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:45,170
this is a throwback from our USB family

736
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:50,299
travel and the vulnerable function is

737
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:51,920
low let's see prepare for missus this

738
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:58,750
Messer can be called from user space

739
00:47:51,920 --> 00:48:05,780
please select 417 and accept ourselves

740

scalar input Papa resize 7 this is the

741
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:13,660
crash friend list this function is you

742
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:17,870
to cress memory buffer with memory to

743
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:21,890
descriptor for the thousand buffer the

744
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:26,900
capacity parameter is the number of

745
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:34,490
piece to look at here we can see that

746
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:39,640
the capacity value is 0xffff obviously

747
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:44,470
is you may need value for this function

748
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,890
this is this is the debug information

749
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:49,430
the last

750
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:53,000
LTB instruction is to read the memory

751
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:57,109
from the start address of in post scale

752
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:02,390
a buffer which can which can impose from

753
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:06,080
user space we can clear sealant the

754
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:08,600
humanity when you is so the value in the

755
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:15,470
scalar buffer so we can control the

756
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:21,259
value of capacity from user space a list

757
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:24,560
is found in in inter accelerator tower

758
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:29,510
and is a one bro function is inter

759

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,830
connections you declined with types 6

762
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:50,420
left finger is the pseudo-code snaps or

763
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:55,029
new TTT function we can sit on it

764
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:58,580
look for GPU access function to get the

765
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:03,760
accelerator system memory address and

766
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:08,360
set it to we add in the place a an

767
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:12,650
impress P memory copy function use we

768
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:17,060
add and destination addresses address

769
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:22,010
for coffee canal to H the right finger

770
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:28,670
is the pseudo cooker snap Oh dog for GPU

771
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:33,380
SS function it obviously shows that it

772
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:36,680
not always return you manage return when

773
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:40,880
it address therefore each LAN co-chair

774
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,890
for the granule we add and the resulting

775
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:48,320
zero page right back

776
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:51,290
when using a memory copy this is that

777
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:56,990
you either divided 0 bar from the MD

778
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:58,850
region X 4000 tower the one book the

779
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:03,979
venerable function can be triggered

780
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:07,670
using our Observatory command Queen

781
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:09,830
service will select her one whose

782
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:13,540
function name is as submit command

buffers and his connection table is 9

784
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:19,970
our accelerator command Queen is used to

785
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:24,069
process the graphical accelerator

786
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:27,859
command information for CD rendering

787
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:30,710
when MD travel press processes is

788
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:35,090
commenced you your it will prepare the

789
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:37,210
MD accelerator resources first and least

790
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:44,180
one bro function is respond go to

791
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:47,390
optimize this resource buffer this is

792
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:52,540
the assembly cost name list one more

793
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:57,049
function identity from register is

794
00:51:52,540 --> 00:52:01,330
initialized with 0 impress a and it will

795
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:06,800
be assigned a new value within the

797
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:13,160
that is not sure

798
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:20,660
therefore it will be resolved in a to

00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:24,890
add is 0 back in press P as I saw this

800
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:28,299
is the this is the tools we mentioned

00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:40,310
English link however this is older

805
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:43,700

806
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:49,350
later thank you
