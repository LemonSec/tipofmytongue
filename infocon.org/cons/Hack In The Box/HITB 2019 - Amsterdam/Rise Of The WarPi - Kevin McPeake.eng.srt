1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,140
so yeah this is my presentation here

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,390
it's normally a much longer presentation

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,180
so Aman try to convince it down in 30

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:32,000
minutes and without trying to speak too

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,820
fast so that people can understand me if

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,860
I do start speaking too fast just hold

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,260
your hand up and let me know so yeah my

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,800
name is Kevin and I hunt wireless and

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,230
and this is one of the maps from wiggle

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,510
if you've never seen will go you can go

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,890
to wiggle net and it's by the way with

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:53,809
1g not to G's and this is my it's

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,039
actually not the most recent update but

14
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,360
you kinda kiddin get an idea I've I've

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,890
and I'll come back to explain some of

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,930
this because I know I've not actually

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,449
been in Iraq but I know where Wi-Fi

18
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,280
access points in Iraq are and I'm going

19
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,670
to explain how I do this

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,649
so yeah there's a few names I go by one

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,840
of the the funniest ones is quick turn

22
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:17,179
off your wireless the other one I forgot

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,039
to put on here was if you've sometimes

24
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:24,830
when I walk into a bar I hear people say

25
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:27,680
oh it's too late we can see him so yeah

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,200
so I've been I've been doing is war

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,930
roaming actually since I got I got my

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,240
start I would had just been capped up

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,790
about a year's worth of talks on Lotus

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,280
Notes security and I returned back to

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,579
Def Con I think it was 2002 and I saw a

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,030
presentation on Wi-Fi and I got the bug

33
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,309
and I started started poking around at

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,979
Wi-Fi learning more about it and ii

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,350
thought you had a another friend of mine

36
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:57,320
Chris Goggins come over and do a Wi-Fi

37
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,750
penetration test or assessment I mean

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,240
for the phone company I was working for

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,850
and we drove all around the Netherlands

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,798
hunting out Wi-Fi rogue access points on

41
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,039
our network and that's really when I got

42
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,959
the bug and needed to do more and so

43
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,859
I've been doing it anonymously on wiggle

44
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,170
for up to around 2011 and then some of

45
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,690
in 2011 a few things changed

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,850
wiggle came out with a application for

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,739
Android and some of my colleagues at the

48
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,760
phone company I was working at got all

49
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,919
excited because now they could

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
participate too they knew I was doing

51
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,230
this and they could do it from their

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,660
Android phone and so they they pushed me

53
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,069
two actually moving out adi anonymous

54
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,390
space because you can contribute

55
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,099
datasets anonymously to wiggle and

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,179
actually register a user name and and

57
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,709
join their group which I did and later

58
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,630
they quit playing with me just because I

59
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:53,080
kept bike just they couldn't keep up

60
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,970
with me yeah so but yeah this is

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,790
actually a few pictures from those times

62
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,709
this is actually at my office and the

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,150
backpack in the laptop I was using

64
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:05,620
around back then and and I various

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,239
different tools I was using at the time

66
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,549
a lot of people ask why I do this

67
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:14,440
there's actually this is a relative I

68
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:16,209
think a very relative question to today

69
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,220
because I hear sometimes a lot of people

70
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,780
are like I thought that was dead I

71
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,260
thought that was a dead hobby and I'm

72
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,329
like there's more Wi-Fi out there the

73
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,489
density of Wi-Fi out there that that I

74
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:30,430
see today is just completely off the

75
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,380
charts and so I think it's actually a

76
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,750
very important thing because everything

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,940
is embedded and wife has some sort of

78
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,920
Wi-Fi embedded everything not just your

79
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,319
laptops not just your mobile phone your

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,350
home automation light switches have

81
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:47,170
Wi-Fi and bidded until you can get some

82
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,108
really great little ESP based light

83
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,540
switches and smarts electrical sockets

84
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,900
and they've got ESP chips in them and

85
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:00,630
they have Wi-Fi in them I've got an

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,829
aquarium system that uses a lot of Wi-Fi

87
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,010
nothing for soup through super

88
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,239
mission-critical stuff but for

89
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,578
collecting information and things like

90
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,130
this I I do have to employ it for some

91
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,840
of the devices I use and it's also

92
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,089
really a lot of fun a lot of people like

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,039
to play Pokemon on their smartphone and

94
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,190
they're that Jakaya took over the

95
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:24,250
Netherlands recently and for me this is

96
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,200
sort of like Pokemon on steroids and or

97
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,240
something like Trainspotting but just

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,070
the next generation by the way this

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,070
picture I captured of this couple this

100
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,260
was Indian hog Central Station and I

101
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,780
just given this version of this talk an

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,390
earlier version of this talk surf net

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,539
and attract and I was coming back home

104
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,520
and just got off the tram and was

105
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:45,830
actually I thought well I'll just stop

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,299
and

107
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,250
hanging out in the station and collect

108
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,650
some wife for about five minutes before

109
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,150
I head on home and this couple was up

110
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,310
their tram spotting so they were

111
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,870
actually spotting trams not the trains

112
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,990
and I talked to him for a few minutes

113
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,210
and he actually had a obsession for the

114
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,849
the taking pictures of all the trams and

115
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,008
he had quite a colorful jacket too but I

116
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:08,960
thought I started to explain to him hey

117
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm kind of like you but with something

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,690
different but I figured he probably

119
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,550
wouldn't understand it would take too

120
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,090
long and I might actually scare him

121
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,659
so I let him be I just thought they were

122
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,340
a really cute couple but yeah my also

123
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,500
blame my father for this my father was

124
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:29,679
electrical two-way radio engineer in the

125
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:32,509
70s 60s 70s and 80s for Motorola and so

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,479
he taught me a lot about the RF spectrum

127
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,460
and ham radio technology he was building

128
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,020
Tesla coils and things like this never

129
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,840
since and I've always had this passion

130
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,669
for understanding all what's around us

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,210
in terms of wavelengths and everything

132
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:50,690
else RFID ad SB I've got a ATSB

133
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,310
Raspberry Pi in my attic the antenna is

134
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,620
actually works really well and I made

135
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,750
that out of a coat hanger I cut it to

136
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,569
the specific lengths and there was a lot

137
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,090
of trial and error but I can on on on

138
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,710
the right weather date the days with the

139
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,869
coat the right weather I can actually

140
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,159
pick up airplanes almost right up to the

141
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,080
shore of the UK generally on average I

142
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,389
can only get about halfway crossed but

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,750
uh I like to watch and also listen to

144
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,629
the air airplane communications and

145
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,719
watch them tracking and anytime my wife

146
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,699
is she often flies over he applies to

147
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,349
other European countries for her jobs

148
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,419
whenever the plane flies over our house

149
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,520
I go out with a huge sixty millimeter

150
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,620
600 millimeter lens and take a picture

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,299
of her plate and then I go here's here's

152
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,349
a picture of you honey so I have some

153
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,789
fun with it it's also interesting

154
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,560
because we have a roof terrace and we

155
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,270
like to watch sunsets and somebody will

156
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,590
say hey I wonder what that plane is you

157
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,620
know where's that coming from and I go

158
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:52,008
oh hair I can tell you so it's it's it's

159
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:57,289
I do this on several spectrums no pun

160
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:59,810
intended and more specific to to to

161
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,280
Wi-Fi and GSM and blue

162
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,190
and the frequencies I've been really

163
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,380
passionate about the last few years it's

164
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,370
wireless surveying and this is something

165
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,409
that from a professional standpoint has

166
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,010
really also experienced doing this as a

167
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,160
hobby

168
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:19,099
his lent itself very well to my career

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,610
working in security and working for GSM

170
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,919
telcos we even had a situation where it

171
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,190
was unbelievable it was we had one of

172
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:31,130
the telcos I was at actually was had

173
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,320
problems with their Wi-Fi and when the

174
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,630
Wi-Fi inside all the retail branches all

175
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,090
around the Netherlands and I ended up

176
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,400
when when a lot of other third-party

177
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,169
vendors and specialist vendors couldn't

178
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,810
figure out why we were having such

179
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,549
crappy Wi-Fi in the retail shops it was

180
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,370
a real pain point for our customers

181
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,690
eventually somebody goes hey that you

182
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,540
know we have this guy who's sort of

183
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,390
obsessive-compulsive about Wi-Fi so

184
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,620
maybe we should go talk to him and that

185
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,020
actually worked out really nice because

186
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,630
I got to to literally ride my bike

187
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,390
around the Netherlands and go measure

188
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,280
Wi-Fi and it was really awesome and I

189
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,010
found figured out the problem in about

190
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,989
two weeks where to Linda's and some

191
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,219
other companies just they worked on it

192
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,620
for months and they couldn't figure out

193
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,419
what the problems were and Allah that

194
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,030
comes back with experience of doing a

195
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,770
lot of this these I call it war roaming

196
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,289
but it's it's quite technically it's

197
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:26,299
Wireless surveying and there's a lot of

198
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,010
other things in security really really

199
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,039
they're related about it

200
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:35,990
that you can figure out i've also have

201
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,390
something kind of like I'm running kes

202
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,299
matt is an intrusion detection system on

203
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,789
my home for both wireless security and a

204
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:46,490
little bit of physical security and the

205
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,710
idea being that if an alarm event

206
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,390
happens I literally snapshot all the

207
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,970
wireless frequencies for forensics

208
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,470
information so if somebody were to break

209
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,270
in and they're using even if they're

210
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,280
using a burner phone or their real phone

211
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,980
I'll have a fingerprint of all their

212
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,890
electronic devices and I figure that

213
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,750
would be useful for the police and it's

214
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,030
something that I also help cooperate

215
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,620
with the police a lot on and I've been

216
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,449
approached by the police in the past to

217
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,810
help with certain wireless

218
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,029
investigations

219
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,420
and criminal defense lawyers and it's

220
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:21,270
also yeah it's also a lot of fun there's

221
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,709
a lot more out there ZigBee z-wave I

222
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,300
have some of these products at my home

223
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,410
but I also like to hack them and see

224
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,050
what's possible as far as just

225
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,069
collecting the data there's a lot of

226
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,380
places where you can do something

227
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,720
interesting with the data to contribute

228
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,450
back to our community and there's

229
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,600
there's wiggle net there's the open cell

230
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,760
ID project and we may even start

231
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,440
something for ZigBee called Zig Lynette

232
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,900
Adam went ahead and registered the

233
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,450
domain and he's been doing all the

234
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,730
ZigBee stuff and he sent me a Killer Bee

235
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,430
to play with and I said hey why don't we

236
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,320
build a wiggle website for ZigBee so

237
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,819
he'd got without even hesitation two

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,010
minutes later he came back he said okay

239
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,470
domains registered I was like wow okay

240
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,720
so I guess now we have to do something

241
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:12,300
so stay tuned there maybe we will

242
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,440
actually get something up online as I

243
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,640
mentioned there's there's there's

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
there's a lot of professional

245
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,970
opportunities I found and one of the

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,589
more interesting ones I'll come back to

247
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,839
talk about in minutes been working for

248
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,089
some dutch lawyers here and actually

249
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,850
giving forensics into evidence because I

250
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,820
I left t-mobile in 2016 and I've been

251
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,490
doing forensics for different clients

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,100
and one of them was the lawyer you're on

253
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:39,150
pin who's kind of well known in the

254
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:43,680
security and privacy aspect of criminal

255
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:45,209
and and privacy law but there's there's

256
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,910
a lot of other opportunities out there

257
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,620
Apple is Apple is literally doing this

258
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,819
if you have an iOS device they're doing

259
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,800
this every day from your mobile phone

260
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,950
and they're collecting the data so is

261
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,540
Google and so we don't really know what

262
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,820
they're all doing with this data they

263
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,800
don't let us yet so all my ideas well we

264
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,320
should do it too and see what they what

265
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,569
they're actually seeing there's also

266
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,339
some interesting things and and there

267
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,670
may be interesting opportunities in the

268
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,230
future in regards to the gdpr and

269
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,370
because there's seems that we have

270
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,709
everyone has a slightly different

271
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,540
opinion on the gdpr and i think that

272
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,329
that will be something interesting that

273
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,770
will develop in the next couple of years

274
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,570
where where does the privacy law

275
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,819
actually lay in regards to Wi-Fi

276
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,120
but I won't get into that I'll try keep

277
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,540
this a little bit more technical so yeah

278
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,110
these are the tools of my trade I do

279
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,150
have a few come by the the Hat wireless

280
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,070
hacking village I have my tools on

281
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,329
display I went ahead and left them down

282
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,140
there and hopefully there's somebody's

283
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,820
watching them to keep them secure and

284
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,620
but I've got I've got one that I had

285
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,050
built a little black box it was one of

286
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,820
the I kind of sometimes I started off

287
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,890
calling it the football because the idea

288
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,930
was it's it's supposed to really work

289
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,810
like an iPod and just be really quick

290
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,339
and easy to fire up and run off then I

291
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,109
really built what was like a Swiss Army

292
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,510
knife and that was really specifically

293
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,510
built so I could hot-swap out any

294
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:15,500
combination of four different wireless

295
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:19,069
types of cards SDRs gsm dongles and this

296
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,740
type of stuff I've ended up building I

297
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,810
believe it's the I've yet to find anyone

298
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,570
to contradict me over the last year I

299
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:30,680
think it's the first Raspberry Pi or

300
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:33,200
even SBC based GSM Stumbler and it's

301
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,010
then it doesn't require an SDR you can

302
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,710
actually use 2g 3G and 4G GSM dongles on

303
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,630
it which kind of makes a few if you want

304
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,360
to get into finding base stations it

305
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:48,110
creates a very low barrier to get

306
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,950
started you could do it with STRs but

307
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,510
one of the reasons I chose to use

308
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,520
dongles is because I had to use it for

309
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,280
submitted submitting evidence to the

310
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,439
Dutch Court and I figured for having a

311
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,170
technical bar of submission of evidence

312
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,940
this just using commercial dongles just

313
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,140
like the police do in their

314
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,760
investigation eliminated a whole lot of

315
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,010
you know are you doing funny things with

316
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,140
SDR data and things like that so I just

317
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,060
I stuck with that and it's extremely

318
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,880
effective far far more effective than

319
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,380
running an app on your smart phone as I

320
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,700
mentioned this is a bit of a I already

321
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,650
mention this but this is a little bit of

322
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,470
my timeline I've obviously been doing

323
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,300
this for quite a while and only been

324
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,380
really recently talking about this and

325
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,109
one of the things I want to talk about

326
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,839
because I hear back since the first talk

327
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:37,940
I gave on this and and talking in the

328
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,180
community there's a lot of people who've

329
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,650
tried to build Raz

330
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,170
replies they kind of get them working

331
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:45,270
Raspberry Pi war rumors they kind of get

332
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,740
them working but they say they

333
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,980
complained that they're not stable so

334
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,380
they go off and they buy a pineapple and

335
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,810
and the pineapples are a nice learning

336
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,060
tool they come already pre-made with the

337
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,250
some of the software and everything but

338
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,280
if you've ever been to DEFCON and for a

339
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,870
period of time going to that you know if

340
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,110
you show up if you show up with a

341
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,080
unhardened pineapple stock bought

342
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,490
directly right if you buy from hak5 and

343
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,110
then go to DEFCON with your pineapple

344
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,740
thinking you're going to do something

345
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,600
fun you're actually going to become the

346
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,460
guinea pig for everybody else because

347
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,030
you will find your pineapple hack pretty

348
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,830
quick so this is why I'm not really keen

349
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,630
on pineapples and I think it's also a

350
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,250
better off learning opportunity for

351
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:35,670
others as well to build a Raspberry Pi

352
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,230
or another SBC could be BeagleBone but I

353
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,900
think it's better to build it yourself

354
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,320
and understand what's really going into

355
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,900
it

356
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,410
and I'm also going to share some of the

357
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:49,620
things of what to do and what not to do

358
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,089
please don't use duct tape it doesn't

359
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,520
hold it together and I'll come back on

360
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,650
this why duct tape see you know it'll

361
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,420
get you through for a five minute quick

362
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,130
assessment but if you really want to do

363
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,699
this as a hobby you need to think a

364
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,710
little bit about making it more durable

365
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,900
also what I don't want

366
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,060
props to draw dark matter I don't know

367
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,980
him personally but I know a lot of other

368
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,239
people a lot of my friends actually know

369
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,190
him and apparently he's a really nice

370
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,650
guy this I believe it was just a stunt

371
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,600
kind of I also heard some other things

372
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,300
I'll mention in a minute but I really

373
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,740
don't want this I'm 51 years old and I

374
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,130
don't wanna be lugging around this type

375
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,320
of weight and I also wanted something

376
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,000
very discrete and I would with this

377
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,650
particularly with my looks I think I

378
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,660
would have I would scare everyone from

379
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,579
airport security just the general police

380
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,130
I was walking around town with this and

381
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,930
I actually do take the devices I have

382
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,880
through airport security usually without

383
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,739
problem I think the funniest stories I

384
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,530
had came from when I went to India with

385
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,150
them but uh they I've I've heard he's

386
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,670
had a lot more trouble through airport

387
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:56,939
security than I have

388
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,639
so so yeah as I mentioned that I do have

389
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,259
respect for dark matter not it's nothing

390
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,389
personal against him I just don't think

391
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,730
that this was a very practical build now

392
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:07,440
I will say every everybody who is on

393
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,329
wiggle and is a war rumor and who's

394
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,819
probably in the top 50 when he came

395
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:15,120
across our newsfeed or if we were at

396
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:17,370
DEFCON and and and saw him in person we

397
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,560
probably thought oh this guy is

398
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,439
going to cream us on the on the wiggle

399
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,529
charts we've got real problems now and I

400
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:28,920
did too I I was I was busy building mice

401
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,449
Maya the device I called gremlin I had

402
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,860
just assembled it and I looked at that

403
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,258
it was kind of like I looked at the

404
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,149
Wi-Fi cactus and it was kind of like

405
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:41,189
hard not to look at it it was like a

406
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:42,660
kick in the gut but one of the things I

407
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,879
started thinking about it's not very

408
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,769
practical device and you really don't

409
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,329
need that many antennas unless you're

410
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,550
moving at a hundred and twenty

411
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,989
kilometers an hour and still then and

412
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,209
I'll get to it in a minute but there's

413
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,089
it's still not going to benefit you like

414
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,069
the way you think it might now I do

415
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,720
agree with them wiggle EDA he gave a

416
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,990
cold presentation will go like you mean

417
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,689
it

418
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,599
and I definitely been wiggling like I

419
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,819
mean it for the last 15 plus years but I

420
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,399
I strongly believe in this that if you

421
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:17,188
if you have a two antenna interface

422
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,949
Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone and you use

423
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:22,470
it every day you are going to leave dark

424
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,270
matter who uses his Wi-Fi cactus maybe

425
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,919
once a month you leave him in the dust

426
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,590
because you're constantly out there

427
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,799
gathering new data and if he fires up

428
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,110
his machine on a blog post I saw of his

429
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,789
I heard it cores out after he's tracking

430
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:43,889
around 14,000 devices and I've done a

431
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:46,020
lot of optimizations into my raspberry

432
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,480
pi builds and software and hardware and

433
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,220
I know I can go to a festival or

434
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:57,659
something like this and discover more

435
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:59,669
than 85,000 SS IDs so so I think that

436
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,980
and yes on a daily basis I average

437
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:04,610
around twenty to thirty thirty thousand

438
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,830
devices and this is just a

439
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,040
a screenshot of one of them in my mini

440
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,110
uploads because there are several files

441
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,810
I just I had to do a little bit of I

442
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,449
highlighted the the relevant

443
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,100
contribution or the numbers and add them

444
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:21,020
up there and that day it came up to

445
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,679
thirty three thousand nine hundred fifty

446
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,139
five and yesterday I'll come to that in

447
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,360
a minute but I actually logged over a

448
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,870
hundred thousand here yesterday at the

449
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,580
conference and I think other people can

450
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,050
do this too you know you can certainly

451
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,020
start and I encourage you if you've

452
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,460
never ever war roomed go to go to the

453
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,960
Android store if you have an Android

454
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,400
photo I'm sorry there's no option for

455
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,500
iOS boo Apple but for Android you can

456
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,830
actually download an app and come on and

457
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,590
get started with that and it's it's the

458
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,320
wiggle app and and start running it now

459
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,629
at the conference and they have some fun

460
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,790
and learn how it works

461
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,460
if you if you've already built a

462
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,639
Raspberry Pi but you've had problems I

463
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,230
hope to address here in a few minutes

464
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,330
some of the problems if you've had

465
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,860
particular problems I hope to maybe give

466
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,110
some contributions to help you with this

467
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,729
and by the way this is just sort of the

468
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,629
proof in the pudding because it's very

469
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:24,830
easy to claim things but this is this is

470
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:27,830
a screenshot from let's see what was the

471
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,750
the numbers so this is when I was at

472
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,970
four and a half million I'm actually at

473
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,390
five million now so this is literally

474
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,530
just about a month ago or so but when

475
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,410
this is when I was at four and a half

476
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,030
million and this I grabbed just this

477
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,370
morning so at least for Dark Matter I

478
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,710
gave more of a recent update of a

479
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,239
screenshot he's still at number three at

480
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,170
three hundred and ninety nine on the

481
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,350
wiggle charts and the interesting the

482
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,200
way you read these this is the number

483
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,300
this is the column here of all the

484
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,220
discovered Wi-Fi the one toward nobody

485
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,980
else has ever seen it but the dark

486
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,050
matter in this case actually has to his

487
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,920
credit two hundred and forty seven

488
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:12,169
thousand discovered Wi-Fi this column

489
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,240
over here is the column where he's all

490
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,960
the Wi-Fi he's ever seen maybe it was

491
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,560
discovered by somebody else but he also

492
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,050
saw

493
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,340
- so there is a tally for that but the

494
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,750
most important one is the one he

495
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,939
discovered that's where all the guys

496
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,600
that's the number on this column where

497
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,900
everybody on wiggle competes and so he's

498
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,669
had the Wi-Fi cactus for more than two

499
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,730
years and he's only tallied around

500
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:40,430
200,000 I'm like I said yesterday I

501
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:43,880
scored around 100,000 in just one day

502
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:47,570
and I only have six wireless interfaces

503
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,080
on my two devices and and that's across

504
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,360
the two devices so so how do I do this

505
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,110
so I've this is one when talk a little

506
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,639
bit about I really encourage my idea

507
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,570
when I when I was started doing this

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,750
when I really up my game in 2015 was was

509
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:10,970
in order to be successful at this I

510
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:13,280
really need to adapt reconsider how is

511
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,550
how would the tools I was using I

512
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,320
previously been using laptops and I

513
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,720
wanted to they're the new raspberry PI's

514
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,550
with the four cores had come out and I

515
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,860
thought okay now this the the PI is

516
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:27,860
becoming a mature platform we can

517
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,139
actually do something with this and I

518
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:34,790
experimented with running three Wi-Fi

519
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:37,520
off of a single PI and I was a little

520
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:39,110
bit of a stability issues but I did try

521
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,379
to figure out where was the optimal

522
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,929
balance but my idea is also that it

523
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,750
should really basically be easier than

524
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:51,350
iPod so I could incorporate it into my

525
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:54,800
daily life and adapt the technology to

526
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:58,370
my life and rather than me adapting my

527
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,460
life to the technology and so so this is

528
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,189
one of the things that I actually spent

529
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,670
several months actually doing excuse me

530
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:11,000
and and that's what I encourage everyone

531
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:13,160
else do to to don't if you're actually

532
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,020
having to spend 30 minutes to fire up

533
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,340
your Raspberry Pi and test it get it

534
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,810
working before you go out you're not

535
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,850
going to end up using it over the long

536
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,740
haul I mean you really should be able to

537
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,439
just press one button throw it in your

538
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,610
bag and go and that's really what I've

539
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,310
done so so also for Warp I've and

540
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,060
technical requirements you really have

541
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,950
to give

542
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,540
consideration on the wireless network

543
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,340
interfaces

544
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,409
choosing the right wireless networking

545
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,800
interfaces makes all the difference in

546
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,020
the world

547
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,620
you also need to have a very reliable

548
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,810
GPS it's it's not worth anything if you

549
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,409
go out and any of these components

550
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,970
actually fell yeah I also have one of my

551
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,920
technical requirements the liquid-filled

552
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:58,370
USB storage for fun and airport security

553
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:01,940
I don't really recommend that but it can

554
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,219
be kind of funny sometimes yeah and I

555
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,970
also chose no fans because the fans suck

556
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,300
and also I don't recommend using in any

557
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,640
type of display on the Raspberry Pi you

558
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,820
use something too remote into it a

559
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,000
tablet your phone because displays also

560
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:24,169
suck power and as I was saying if you

561
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,030
don't have RF monitor mode which is you

562
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,540
really have to look and choose your out

563
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:33,320
if you if you use a non alpha network

564
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,810
card and they are a vendor by the way

565
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,899
then you really need to investigate most

566
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:42,020
of the Alpha network cards support RF

567
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,030
Mon our RF Mon but they not all of them

568
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,860
so you still have to double check it and

569
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,450
if you're not familiar with what RF Mon

570
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,189
is you actually have like six different

571
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:54,430
modes of operation and your your

572
00:23:49,190 --> 00:24:02,900
wireless network interface and oops

573
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:05,600
sorry so so the the RF Mon mode is the

574
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,240
the mode would actually your Wi-Fi

575
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,669
interface is completely silent and all

576
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,620
it does is listen and it listens to all

577
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,560
the broadcasts from the access point and

578
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,290
all the broadcasts from the client and

579
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,649
this is how this mode is how people are

580
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,450
able to find if you have a stealth or

581
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,340
cloaked Wi-Fi access point this is how

582
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,720
they're able to find it if you don't

583
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,429
have this mode you can't find the

584
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,380
stealth mode and you can't find

585
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,200
sometimes the the broadcast from the

586
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,120
clients which tell you about the access

587
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,930
points that they're trying to contact or

588
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,330
are already talking to this is an

589
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,070
important thing and and although Isis

590
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,800
although I do sometimes call this an

591
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,659
advanced talk

592
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,669
come on war roaming it's advanced

593
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,710
because nobody's doing the basic stuff

594
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,930
sometimes I find I get a lot of people

595
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,910
saying yeah my pie keeps crashing I try

596
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,160
to run you know stick to Wi-Fi

597
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,140
interfaces on it and it just cores out I

598
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,020
don't understand after 30 minutes or

599
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,750
while I'm walking around town it freezes

600
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,730
up in panics your cables probably suck

601
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,240
and I'm not talking just the the

602
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:11,040
connector or if you bought cables that

603
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,510
say they're heavy-duty or something like

604
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,240
this you really need to get an

605
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,100
electrical USB tester and really qualify

606
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,290
your cables before you start using them

607
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,500
the Raspberry Pi is extremely dependent

608
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:24,659
on very stable power supply and if you

609
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,330
have if your connector is loose on

610
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,730
either your your Wi-Fi NIC you can you

611
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,830
can literally lose a Wi-Fi network

612
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,870
interface or the battery can cause the

613
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,639
kernel panics to actually happen so this

614
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:38,129
you really have to pay attention to this

615
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,490
and the the tip that I recommend on the

616
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,320
the free tip on that is the samsung

617
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,150
cables that come with samsung mobile

618
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,330
phone SIM seem to be some of the best

619
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,250
out there and also some of their

620
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,720
aftermarket ones are they're certainly

621
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,730
better than anything you'll buy at

622
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,040
Mediamark that claims to be heavy-duty

623
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:59,430
most the heavy-duty ones just have extra

624
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,200
plastic insulation in them so I'm one

625
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,650
honey I'm looking at the time I need to

626
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,510
skip on through real quickly this is

627
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:11,940
gizmo you can come by and see him I've

628
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:15,150
really made him so I literally can

629
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:18,330
control him with the Apple infrared mini

630
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,790
remote and and he's been extremely

631
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,629
effective he also works together with

632
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:26,190
gremlin so I can use either device if

633
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:27,870
I'm just going out to the store to the

634
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,790
market for thirty minutes I'll take

635
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:33,449
gizmo because he's so small and I can

636
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,310
still have room for groceries but if I'm

637
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,620
out in a long haul I'll take gremlin

638
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,450
with me too both of these devices are

639
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:43,770
capable of working with each other and

640
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,750
I've tuned the interfaces between the

641
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,770
two of them to work cooperatively

642
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,870
together or separately and by that I

643
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,710
actually mean literally tuning into how

644
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:57,070
many channels and of

645
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,980
what their which ones they spend the

646
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,200
most time on and another free tip to do

647
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,400
this go to wiggle and look in the

648
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,110
country where you're going to be war

649
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,660
rubbing and find what are the most

650
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,209
popular used channels in your area and

651
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,980
adjust your war roaming equipment to

652
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,850
spend most the time on those channels

653
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:19,140
and you can actually optimize your your

654
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,139
performance this way

655
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,640
the other thing that they do is all my

656
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:28,120
devices that I've been playing with they

657
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,440
also share GPS data using GPS D even

658
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,409
though each one of them has their own

659
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,230
chip this way if one of them loses GPS

660
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:39,490
lock they can grab GPS data from the

661
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,309
other one from one of the other pies so

662
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,980
this is yeah this is basically what I

663
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,600
was saying earlier you why use two or

664
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,550
four when you can optimize for six

665
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,428
antennas in my case this is what I've

666
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,139
done and I prioritize one six and eleven

667
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,420
channels on to atenas and all the other

668
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,800
frequencies are spread across the other

669
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:03,280
Forex in US and so this is really up my

670
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,710
performance game on when I go out and

671
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm able to get thirty thousand SSIDs in

672
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,570
the space of an hour and just as proof

673
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,399
in the pudding this is the city of The

674
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,290
Hague and this is this is my coverage

675
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,140
map this I've done all of this I've been

676
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:21,250
on every street sidewalk and bicycle

677
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,780
path and The Hague and even more I've

678
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,400
been this is me all across the

679
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:29,260
Netherlands these are all my personal

680
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,480
more rumps and yeah this is this is

681
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,910
that's not my map but that's an idea if

682
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,710
you want to know about the Wi-Fi density

683
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,410
across the Netherlands that's what it

684
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,880
looks like and so this is there's a

685
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,929
whole lot more out there that still

686
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,370
hasn't been discovered this one I'm

687
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:47,830
gonna have to kind of skip this way I

688
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,479
had wanted to do a talk on this but it

689
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,600
wasn't accepted but I thought I'd just

690
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,570
leave a few of these slides in here I

691
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,030
did build a GSM Stumbler and this is the

692
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:00,370
spike and I wrote the software I'll be

693
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,800
releasing it this summer I wrote it in

694
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,919
Python and I call it heady GSM after

695
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,470
hedy lamarr be

696
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,000
without her she was an awesome woman and

697
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,560
we probably wouldn't be doing all the

698
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,710
wireless stuff we're all doing these

699
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,440
days but I've got it's capable of

700
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:21,210
running up to four four different GSM

701
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,610
dongles in it and it's a runtime of ten

702
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,770
hours and they actually can go longer

703
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,330
because I figured out how to do a little

704
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,400
bit of primitive power management

705
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,500
through the USB ports by shutting down

706
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,280
USB ports one like the device isn't

707
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,890
moving for more than 15 minutes and

708
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,680
that's that's the manual for how Hettie

709
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,690
GSM works there's four commands that's

710
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,400
compatible with wiggle and open so ID

711
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:49,200
and yeah that's the the GUI on it so I

712
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,540
have different screen for every mobile

713
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,400
network that it's actually on and it

714
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,580
just performs the same thing as like the

715
00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,330
Nokia net monitor from the days of old

716
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:03,750
but it does it for 2g 3G and 4G and logs

717
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,010
all the GPS data and yeah the brief

718
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,840
mentioned the presentation will be

719
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,910
online so you can go back and read this

720
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,730
that was sort of a documentation of also

721
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,020
because my performance numbers on GSM on

722
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,300
Google started going up

723
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,450
I see I'm out of time but I'll just show

724
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,470
you the last that's the GSM map of

725
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,340
different base stations and the

726
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,990
interesting thing here is how much our

727
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:28,439
modern smartphones are hopping between

728
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,090
base stations these days which is far

729
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,450
different than how it used to be 15

730
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:36,560
years ago so I'm out of time I hope at

731
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:39,750
least it was somewhat informative and

732
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,700
useful to your future efforts and

733
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,230
exploits and wireless if you decide to

734
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,450
go this way and I really encourage it

735
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,120
and I'm available to come chat with the

736
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:51,090
wireless hacking village and we can talk

737
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,300
more about it and that's that's all I've

738
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,419
got

739
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:58,740
thank you very much thank you

740
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:02,030
thank you Kevin for for bringing all

741
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,030
your projects into the stage

742
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,210
you
