1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,690
hello everyone I'm very happy to be here

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,689
it's my first time to present a talk at

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,970
HP TB so I don't so familiar so be

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:35,010
familiar with this procedure

5
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:39,089
my name is Lee Rico from 360 technology

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,150
I not only focus on out t-mobile network

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,239
security today I'm going to talk about

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:51,000
the vulnerability Alti public warning

9
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,980
system oh okay here's agenda first I'm

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,210
going to introduce you what's the public

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,849
warning system LT and what it's used for

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,190
so I'm going to talk about what's the

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,500
vulnerability LT protocol which may

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,590
cause the mobile phone receiving mistake

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,210
warning message next I walk bling how to

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,490
trigger the vulnerability next step and

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,710
it can be divided into two steps first

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,589
thing is to view the out here take base

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,289
station then second step is to forge the

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,600
fake warning message in the last part I

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,130
will explain the potential risk of the

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,309
vulnerability and the wisest

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,199
vulnerability exists and now what we can

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,179
do to prevent it okay I'm going to talk

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,350
about the details about what it's public

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:42,810
warning system in LTE network public

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,100
warning system is used to alert the

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,959
public to such disasters satellite

29
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,020
saikai earthquake and to smonny

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,789
a nuclear war even in zombie outbreak

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,759
well yeah in other words when you

32
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:57,810
receive a public warning warning message

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,789
on your mobile phone

34
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,590
but your own means that you may be in

35
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,190
big trouble you should find a safer

36
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,170
place as soon as possible there are four

37
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,750
kinds of public warning system all of

38
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,160
the world in our t network because

39
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,440
different countries may require may have

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,230
different requirements on delivering the

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,760
warning message that aluminium mobile

42
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,319
network standard organizations will PV

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,260
provide different warning system for

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,018
different countries in Japan it is eg WS

45
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,890
which is a earthquake and tsunami

46
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:38,100
warning

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:41,069
system USA it is CMS which is commercial

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,459
mobile alert surface unfolding the e TW

49
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,339
s and CMS the Korean public alert system

50
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,670
KP s was standards self-sterilizing

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,480
released 10 and the you alert in release

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,339
11 for European countries though the

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,410
public warning system all of the world

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,080
are not the same but they shared the

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:08,010
common procedure and the common

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:10,680
architecture Harry Ganga top of American

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,630
public warning system CMEs is about a

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,640
missile alert

59
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,739
however the warning message is a force

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:31,440
falsely issued by the network center

61
00:03:16,739 --> 00:04:34,470
let's see the details it under heavy so

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:04:36,390
I have the voice sorry sorry I don't

63
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,570
have the voice

64
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,570
[Music]

65
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:47,959
is it is your mana new IP No

66
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,959
[Music]

67
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,780
you

68
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:43,969
what an all-male teeny solution that's

69
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:48,628
increased early oh maybe this is because

70
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:53,190
on your laptop increase the volume value

71
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:56,130
is 100 you are 100 plus 100 but maybe it

72
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:01,530
is because this juice transform is

73
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:05,340
digitally how I will speak I mean

74
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:09,900
speakers as sorry the video is about the

75
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:13,039
house missile alert is this the missile

76
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,198
alert is a trigger is a issued by the

77
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,878
operator of the universe in her it is

78
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:28,380
not it is not issued by attacker at a

79
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:30,750
just a mistake of the operator well we

80
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,330
may wonder is it possible then the

81
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,889
message can be can be forged by the

82
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,419
attack by an attacker

83
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,419
the answer is yes

84
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,818
we found that some venerable the in the

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,990
LT air interface may cause he move alpha

86
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,370
and receiving these fake warning message

87
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,130
let's learn about the basic architecture

88
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,770
of the public warning system in LT

89
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,500
protocol the CB and a CBC are

90
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,750
responsible for producing the warning

91
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,509
message enemy and env are responsible

92
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,389
for delivering running master due to the

93
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,370
users I can see that there many

94
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,380
interfaces and all evolve in the public

95
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,539
learning system well except the air

96
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,580
interface other parts are very hard

97
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,889
touch it so we could toast something

98
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,349
over the air interface LT warning

99
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:22,199
message transmitted from the LT tower to

100
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:25,979
the three mobile phones are over the air

101
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,960
the message are not encrypted or or

102
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,520
interpreted protected they are

103
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,680
transmitted in clear text

104
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,289
mobile and done the authenticated is

105
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,419
based

106
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,430
during salary selection so we may

107
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:42,508
receive a fake warning message from a

108
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:44,949
malicious base station oh okay our top

109
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:48,669
how explain how to trigger a

110
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:50,409
vulnerability we need to use a LT fake

111
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,659
base station to send the malicious

112
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,938
warning message first our introduce to

113
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,089
you how to set up a fake base station

114
00:07:54,939 --> 00:08:00,219
and configure the parameters properly

115
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:03,189
the hardware is not complicated only one

116
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:06,039
computer and stop and one st our devices

117
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,610
are needed so as the our device is used

118
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,430
to sinha

119
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,800
send and receive RF signals and the

120
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:15,490
computer used to run the LT protocol

121
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,369
stack sir as TR device we use days us ha

122
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,369
PP - Wow and the laptop used is thing

123
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:24,699
but the seven CPU is recommended because

124
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:27,279
the LT has a very large bandwidth we use

125
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:30,959
the audacity which is a free and open

126
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:34,479
source LT software suit to run our own

127
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:38,068
if fake base station currently they are

128
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,079
three popular LT open source platform

129
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:45,430
respectively is open air interface as

130
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:49,569
asked RT and priority well as as energy

131
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:52,239
and code structure is very clear easy to

132
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:54,040
read and modify the project has always

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,819
been maintained so it is relatively

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:02,219
stable thus we use which use a society

135
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:02,219
as our planet and it has two platform

136
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:12,040
okay we want our fake base station

137
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,680
acting more like a normal base station

138
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,500
so we should so wish to get some

139
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,229
parameters from the real base station we

140
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:25,480
use a the the app LTE discovery app to

141
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,060
get the real base station parameters and

142
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,759
we configure the parameters to the to

143
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:38,130
the to our as as our T configuration

144
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:41,529
file which the notice the TAC MCC MSC

145
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:45,630
these parameters should be a 10-5 is e

146
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,630
should be same with the real one

147
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:55,030
I will explain how to treat how to pull

148
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,860
the mobile phone from the real one to

149
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:03,130
our fake base station the it is a pistol

150
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,440
cell reflection mechanism set the cell

151
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,450
reflection means that mobile phone can

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,550
monitor the signal strength Nassim

153
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,870
quality of model of multiple base

154
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:18,599
station he had mode if the if the top of

155
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:21,400
the signal power is a very high the the

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:28,570
mobile phone were attached to Daddy to

157
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:30,010
that take base station okay awesome all

158
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,410
the things we need to know have been

159
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,270
done to set up a fake base station let's

160
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,910
see how to forty of fake warning message

161
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,430
these fake warning message are carried

162
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,550
by the Ephrem system information block

163
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:48,790
of our t there are certain types of

164
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:51,699
system from any block however the ETA up

165
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:56,400
et WS the Japan's public warning systems

166
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:00,360
a message is carried by the asabi 10

167
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,640
this is a first lab first level

168
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,460
notification is a caravan sabatons the

169
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:11,020
secondary notification is carried by the

170
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:13,870
size-11 well the other three public

171
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:22,060
warning systems the message are all

172
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:25,090
carry pass as by the SP 12 here I'm

173
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,760
going to talk how to afford the ETA

174
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:33,990
obvious message the ETS is the Japanese

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,990
public warning systems messages

176
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,829
[Music]

177
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:48,240
according to the specification we should

178
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,240
set the method method in the fire to

179
00:11:48,660 --> 00:12:02,600
to the zero axle for for the ECW s4 for

180
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:08,250
the truth money and warning message the

181
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:13,500
the figure above ad he is a structure of

182
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:16,680
the as a beat it is a superb shot from

183
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:20,520
the from the specification is really

184
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,489
standard and the the figure below is the

185
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:33,090
source code we added in the SLT code and

186
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:35,490
the detail from her we set the order for

187
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,650
the mobile phone to receive as a baton

188
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,290
is also necessary to add schedule

189
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,600
information yes a p1 as a dy is

190
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,610
responsible for scheduling other system

191
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,640
information blocks I'll show in the

192
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,740
figure we use complex TM tool to capture

193
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,960
the baseband signaling of the mobile

194
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,940
phone we can see that our mobile phone

195
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,140
has successfully received as a between

196
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,360
continuing each EWS primarily message

197
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:07,080
and it has a stable one contend the as

198
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:10,290
mapping information for a saboteur steps

199
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:15,060
out besides that we also have to use the

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:19,130
page a message to to trigger the etw as

201
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:22,500
primary notification the page message is

202
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:24,390
the order to save energy the frequency

203
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,070
of the mobile phone to receive the

204
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,040
system information is relatively low

205
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,920
such it cannot meet me to the first

206
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,650
second first 4 seconds time restriction

207
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,800
required by Japan while the frequency of

208
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:40,770
receiving PD message is relatively high

209
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,079
and the interval it's fixed is a fixed

210
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,079
so the protocol stabilised Adam petty

211
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,170
method is similar insistent with the

212
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,240
saboteur

213
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,839
the fever is of the is also called we

214
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,740
added to send the page a message with

215
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,160
the pwas notification notification

216
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:06,270
indication here

217
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,920
the demo of the cranberry notification

218
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:13,980
it is a warning hey the earthquake

219
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,959
warning because we don't have the voice

220
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:24,650
so how well he's playing to you what

221
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:29,270
happened in it has a sound it is a

222
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:35,069
personal reminder in a very loud with

223
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:39,480
alarm first we start the the fake base

224
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:41,700
station and the mobile phone without a

225
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,200
mediator position at that time the

226
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:50,190
Mughal and well receive the receiver

227
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:54,060
message and it will send out harsh alarm

228
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,750
and the the the in kws primary

229
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,709
notification cannot custom the custom

230
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:07,430
the content so it is just the basic etw

231
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,430
s it is preset in the mobile phones app

232
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,770
well the etw secondary notification can

233
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,340
custom to continue we can modify the

234
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:24,510
content we can use it as a spam message

235
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:28,740
or throughout a message it's very hard

236
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:33,390
to tell it is genuinely a earthquake too

237
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:38,280
small in warning message oh this is also

238
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:39,600
the basic of the of the secondary new

239
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:46,439
difficult because we don't have an

240
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:51,920
outcome so skip that the Cape traveler -

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:54,930
to transfer the warning message from

242
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,209
because the the warning message will

243
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,729
send out the harsh alarm but when we set

244
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:07,650
the identifier from 0 X 1 or 2 0 X 1 2

245
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:11,940
ZT Hub we are not well no harsh alarm

246
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,930
just a very mild bells yeah and just

247
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,720
like in editing

248
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:20,769
teenie geenie and the

249
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:24,470
this reminder sorry no sound AK can just

250
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:30,560
imitate and this is the ku-ku-ku-ku

251
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:33,680
pixels response we can we can melt and

252
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:40,149
it can custom any Eddie continue want

253
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,149
and it seems you want in any language

254
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:53,349
ok here the example of the primary

255
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,350
notification the sex anger in the fish

256
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:30,560
okay here comes the the custom custom

257
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:32,600
message oh well all the policy we have

258
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,600
done before our pissed on the Kouga

259
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,730
pixel we have also too many tests on the

260
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,959
other phones but we met several problems

261
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:45,140
because we are from China the PWS is not

262
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:49,820
supported by China so our domestic

263
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:54,440
Verne's a phones Android phones have

264
00:17:49,820 --> 00:18:01,399
removed the remove function but but our

265
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:05,770
domestic apples act reactively little

266
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:10,040
weird so we cannot trigger the iPhones

267
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:15,050
warning alarm in our domestic network

268
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:19,370
but we can set hub of set have a test

269
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:24,950
appeal network to figure it but I think

270
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:28,330
if you are in a country that support

271
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:35,870
support PWAs we can also trigger deep

272
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:36,850
phones iPhones alarm this is a demo of

273
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,639
reference

274
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:52,669
it would also trigger it this is a this

275
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:56,690
the message we set is CMS test okay well

276
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:59,080
here is the conclusion part let's see

277
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,000
what risk can be caused by the forelock

278
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,129
warning alarm remind that if there is

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,150
affordable stadium for people just like

280
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,160
the picture at this time malicious LTI

281
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,850
base station transmit the horrible a

282
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,890
warning message saying a warning magnet

283
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,199
a to10 earthquake is coming in one

284
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,240
minute as the word message is

285
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,370
the verdict hot message it can be

286
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,190
received by all the people

287
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,408
simultaneously and the mobile phones

288
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,130
supporting pwas would make alarm song

289
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:35,250
this may cause a huge panic and even

290
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,070
cause a stampede also the abuse of

291
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,500
warning message may cause the top PWAs

292
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,049
paralyzed when we know real disaster

293
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:49,110
comes nobody taken it seriously it's

294
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:50,580
just like the cry off I see what we can

295
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,979
do to prevent the warning message

296
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,309
technically because the world the false

297
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:59,149
warning message is issued by the fake

298
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,720
base station so we can add add a

299
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:04,139
authentication procedure

300
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,929
whenever the mobile phone decide to camp

301
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:10,399
on a new cell another way is to add a

302
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:13,289
signature to the broadcast information

303
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:17,489
the authentication procedure to consume

304
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:19,110
a lot of power so the signature way is

305
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,429
better let's see the detail the

306
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:26,219
signature way in this solution networks

307
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,779
need to have the parabola keys and a

308
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,110
mobile phone can obtain the

309
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,630
corresponding public keys and verify

310
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:38,158
their authenticity the network can use

311
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:42,389
this however the key to a bit to app and

312
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:45,059
a digital signature to the PWS signaling

313
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:48,809
message and you you can verify the

314
00:20:45,059 --> 00:21:14,129
authenticity of this message okay here

315
00:20:48,809 --> 00:21:17,349
is it okay hardware

316
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,349

available online any other questions

319
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,440
okay great thank you again we'll take a

320
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,439
few seconds here get set up
