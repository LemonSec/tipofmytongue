1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,140
good morning thank you for attending my

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,200
talk so for many people contemn

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,520
computing is a very theoretical so this

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,860
talk

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,550
the goal of disability is to go deeper

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,370
into the practical perspective the

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,890
quantum computing so we'll talk about

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,320
different topics the basics of course

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,940
then we will talk about the quantum

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,989
computing simulators if you want to

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,440
experience by yourself and now we are

12
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,199
lucky enough to have free contemn

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,280
computing cloud services so you will be

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,530
able to do your own quantum computing

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:07,830
computations on the cloud and we will

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,950
talk about different topics around

17
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,060
cryptography how to reverse

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,090
cryptographic primitives

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,140
they are method here two ways to do that

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,200
and I will see examples about CSA 8 and

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,599
IES right and then we will finish with

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,950
the post contemn cryptography to see

23
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,410
what are the solutions for the future

24
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:36,090
but first let me introduce myself so I'm

25
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:38,670
only sheets coming from Paris France I'm

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,800
a security expert working a digital

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,649
security which is a subsidiary of the

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,560
Econo come group my main interests are

29
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,619
mostly security of protocols and number

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,450
theory that includes cryptography of

31
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,659
course

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,020
but let's start first with the basics of

33
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,490
quantum computing so I'm pretty sure you

34
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:06,360
know a few basics so this is to remember

35
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:10,318
you the basics of first small-scale

36
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:14,060
objects like atoms molecules photon

37
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:18,890
electron and so on both behaves them as

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:22,200
particles and waves during experiments

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,660
it depends the way you measure of them

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,880
if you measure like them like particles

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,030
if you want to have a position for

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,269
example they will behave as a particle

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:36,870
if you want to measure a frequency or if

44
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:40,560
you want to measure a power they will

45
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:45,360
behave as a wave so it depends how you

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,489
miss your them actually right another

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,220
interesting topic about consumed

48
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,549
computing and quantum physics in general

49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,280
is the main characteristic of these

50
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,070
objects are not defined when they are

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,489
created I've read everybody sings a

52
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:05,190
particle as a position and a speed it's

53
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:10,890
not the case until you measure them

54
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:13,320
actually when you create a particle when

55
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,899
the particle is created first it has no

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,720
position and no speed it's when you will

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,950
measure on it that they will it will get

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:29,130
that those figures will get defined upon

59
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:33,350
measurements right so what we will say

60
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:36,030
actually that they have a probabilistic

61
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,569
position and a probabilistic speed for

62
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,959
example or probabilistic frequency and

63
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:45,179
also measure them this probabilistic

64
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,760
function will collapse into a single

65
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,250
value and the actual position and speed

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,120
will get defined at this point so this

67
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,060
is the third point

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:00,849
so consequently it's not possible to

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:04,150
measure some physical properties of a

70
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,129
particle and then copy them into another

71
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,769
one that's not possible it's the

72
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:12,450
no-cloning theorem and you can actually

73
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:16,149
prove it because it's a serum and

74
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:19,659
strangely you can take these properties

75
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:23,049
into account and define a way to do

76
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,690
powerful computations even if this seems

77
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,910
constraints you can use these

78
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:32,700
constraints to do a lot of powerful

79
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:35,940
computations so how does it work in

80
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,490
traditional computing you use bits as

81
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,620
information in content computing you

82
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:46,419
really use qubits that is to say

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:53,260
particles that can be 1 or 0 like bits

84
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:56,650
but that can be also a combination of 0

85
00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,550
and 1 a superposition of 0 and 1 because

86
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:04,870
the particle can behave like 0 and one

87
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,180
owns they get the get Monsieur so when

88
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,320
they get Monsieur they will have a fixed

89
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:15,130
value but before they will behave like

90
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,560
they are similar they are at the same

91
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,520
time 0 and 1 so when you will do

92
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,680
computation with that kind of qubits

93
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,020
they will take all the possible values

94
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,500
so you will have all the possible

95
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,570
results at the same time at the end of

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,690
the computation so that's very powerful

97
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:39,840
of course because when you have a

98
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:43,539
growing number of qubits you have a huge

99
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,810
field of results that gets computed at

100
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,900
the same time virtually the difficulty

101
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,010
will will be to focus on the result and

102
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,000
find the interesting result in all the

103
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:01,060
possibilities right so in a mathematical

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,540
point of view a qubit is a vector of two

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:11,050
values for example

106
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:16,870
the cubits cat 0 is 1 0 and the cubits

107
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:18,940
one is 0 1 and they form a basis from a

108
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,310
mathematical point of view that is to

109
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,080
say every qubit is a linear combination

110
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,660
of 0 and 1 with different probabilities

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,260
that can be 100% zero another person one

112
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:37,930
or a combination of both that is to say

113
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:40,659
50 50 or 20 80 and so on there are ways

114
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:45,070
to combine qubits to form what is called

115
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:50,530
qubit registers using a tensor product

116
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:54,300
so that's very mathematical so don't be

117
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:57,940
afraid of that it's not a major point

118
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:01,060
but the easiest way to visualize a qubit

119
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:08,320
is to take a sphere what is called Bloch

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:11,980
sphere and say the zero qubit is like an

121
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,420
arrow in a unit sphere that points to

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,160
the top and the one qubit is an arrow

123
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,100
that points to the bottom of the sphere

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,500
that is to say they are opposites on the

125
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:28,240
sphere and on a sphere you can rotate

126
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,340
the vector on basically every axis that

127
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,640
is to say you can rotate the vector over

128
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,710
the x axis or the other Y axis or other

129
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:42,070
the z axis and quantum computing is

130
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:45,370
actually exactly this only rotations

131
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,380
around the three axis so on so you

132
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,110
visualize this you are able to do any

133
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,350
kind of quantum computation just by

134
00:07:50,110 --> 00:08:00,910
rotating the vector around the three

135
00:07:53,350 --> 00:08:03,160
axis right what's interesting in quantum

136
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,480
computing is that for thermodynamic

137
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:11,080
reason consume gate what is the concern

138
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,660
gates it's like a gate in traditional

139
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,330
computing that is to say hand gates or

140
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,289
or gate or czar gates in traditional

141
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,960
computing you can have

142
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,080
exactly the same thing with quantum

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,409
gates but they're a bit different

144
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:31,909
because quantum gates must be reversible

145
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:34,519
why because when you compute in a given

146
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:38,828
environment you're violent it is very

147
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,810
fragile you cannot have any kind of

148
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,789
modification from the external

149
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,219
environment external environment so you

150
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,029
environment should be completely closed

151
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:52,550
completely isolated from the outside so

152
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:56,509
you can have any kind of energy going in

153
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,930
or going out your environments so photon

154
00:08:56,509 --> 00:09:04,240
or dynamic reason you cannot have any

155
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,239
energy that is consumed or that is a

156
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:12,949
fuel that outside so that way your

157
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:16,579
system does not consume any kind of

158
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:19,790
power during computation so the

159
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:22,939
computation is completely reversible so

160
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:26,000
for example in a traditional computing

161
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:29,829
you have the on gate the on gate you

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,899
have through two inputs and one output

163
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:35,680
but of course this is not reversible

164
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,350
because from the output you cannot guess

165
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,239
the previous two inputs in computing you

166
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,230
will be able to do that because every

167
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,209
basically every single contaminate is

168
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,829
reversible because of thermodynamic

169
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:53,750
reason you cannot have any kind of of

170
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,979
energy coming in or out from your

171
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,449
environment so it's completely

172
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,649
reversible so every gate that is

173
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:07,250
reversible will be a Contin gate

174
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:11,149
basically okay so let's see a few

175
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,600
examples will be more easy for you to

176
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,470
understand the easiest quantum gate is

177
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,930
the pulley x8 that is to say against

178
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,040
rotating the qubits around the x axis

179
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:29,779
and have the we have seen if you rotate

180
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:33,800
the the zero vector around the x axis

181
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:39,259
you get the one vector the one cubit

182
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:42,529
vector if you rotate it in in the

183
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:45,920
opposite way so this will be a rotation

184
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:48,680
around the x-axis and the gate who does

185
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,110
the rotation is the poly XK that is to

186
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,870
say it's similar to the not gate in

187
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,839
traditional computing you get the

188
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,180
opposite qubits yeah when you input 0

189
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,439
you get one when you get you a new input

190
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:07,819
1 you get 0 it's completely similar to

191
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:15,370
the not gate and it has a matrix you see

192
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:21,290
that is the the normal mattress rotated

193
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:24,949
at 80 80 degrees 90 degrees sorry and if

194
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:29,569
you apply two times the poly X get of

195
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:32,719
course you come at the initial point so

196
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:35,949
it's it get cancelled and you have the

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,449
identity gate which does nothing right

198
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:41,979
another interesting gate is the other

199
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:45,170
margate the other male gates actually

200
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,350
transforms any fixed qubits for example

201
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,500
the ket 0 ket 1 2 bits into a

202
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,889
superposition an equal superposition of

203
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,069
0 and 1 so this gate will be fundamental

204
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,990
and will be very important because it's

205
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:02,689
basically the gate you will find at

206
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:07,189
every input circuit when you are doing a

207
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:13,519
contem computing circuits because this

208
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:16,610
gate will will enable you to do parallel

209
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:22,220
computation over all the possible input

210
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:27,079
values of your circuits right so it

211
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:29,569
transformed a fixed qubit like 0 & 1 to

212
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,819
a superposition of 0 & 1

213
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:35,939
with exactly the same probability so you

214
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:39,780
get half of the time 0 alpha 210 1

215
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,000
and you can use it to initialize your

216
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:49,829
inputs to do parallel computation on a

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,930
set of qubits another useful content

218
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,660
gates because we have seen quantum gates

219
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,410
with only one input and one output so

220
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,990
this time the seanut gates will be very

221
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,069
useful because it's the simplest gate

222
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:08,670
with two inputs and two outputs and

223
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:11,220
basically it's a if not gate okay

224
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,459
that is to say it has two inputs the

225
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,180
control gates and sorry the control

226
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:21,240
qubits and the target qubit and it

227
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,780
basically tests if the control qubit is

228
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,710
true and if the control qubit is true it

229
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:32,880
will negate the target the target qubits

230
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:37,950
right so basically it makes if the

231
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:41,310
inputs is true then negates the target

232
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:46,230
qubits and if the input is false do

233
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:52,290
nothing right so the symbol is that one

234
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:56,130
a small plain circle and a large empty

235
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:58,620
circle right and it test if the first

236
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,620
qubit is one and if the first qubit is

237
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,630
one it will negate apply the the poly

238
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:11,370
gates to the second qubit it's the C

239
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:14,160
naught gate and when you have multiple C

240
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,900
naught gates that is to say a synod gate

241
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,120
with many control qubits and only one

242
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:24,120
target qubits that is called toefl gates

243
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,340
and to fully gates are universal with

244
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,810
Stoffel gates you can basically program

245
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:35,280
any kind of traditional gates like and

246
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,849
orgs or make additions make tests and so

247
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,499
on

248
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:45,089
a simple gate also is the swap gates

249
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:51,009
that only swaps two qubits so that's

250
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:53,799
very easy to understand and when you

251
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,799
have sufficiently announced gates you

252
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,779
can have a universal set of gates that

253
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,049
is to say you will be able to combine

254
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:04,479
them to give you any kind of circuit you

255
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:08,739
want any kind of circuit that does

256
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:10,899
arithmetic operation that does algorithm

257
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:15,220
that does everything okay

258
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:17,229
so 240 gates only is a universal set of

259
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,339
gates if you have only have two fully

260
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:24,879
gates you can manage to do everything in

261
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:29,470
traditional algorithms and any kind of

262
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:33,869
function right but generally it's easier

263
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,019
sorry to have a set with other margate

264
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:38,889
phase-shift

265
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,229
gates that makes the rotation of the the

266
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,079
face that is to say the z axis and

267
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:46,569
controller not gates so that's the case

268
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,618
on basically every content ships

269
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:53,319
available now so we will use three or

270
00:15:50,619 --> 00:16:01,899
four different gates to manage to have

271
00:15:53,319 --> 00:16:05,128
any kind of circuits anyway there are

272
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:08,619
some difficulties with quantum computing

273
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:10,209
because you cannot copy a register into

274
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:14,649
another house that's the no-cloning

275
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:18,459
theorem or better said you cannot copy

276
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:21,369
them in a independent way when you apply

277
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:27,368
a register into another register they

278
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:31,269
will get linked and they are magically

279
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:33,309
linked right you cannot have an

280
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:36,699
independent copy like in a program when

281
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:39,728
you set a equals B what you simply

282
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:43,809
simply copy the value of B into eighths

283
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:46,319
that's not very possible in the quantum

284
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:50,889
world right of course you don't have

285
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:53,679
that many qubits in contem ships

286
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:56,619
because they are expensive and because

287
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,689
you you need to protect them from the

288
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:00,399
outer environment and it's quite

289
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:02,949
complicated to have many many

290
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,910
independents actual bits protected from

291
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:10,480
the environments

292
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:13,799
so usually you computes with only a few

293
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:20,019
dozens cubits not more that's the

294
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:22,629
current records nowadays and you can

295
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:25,750
have arrows of course if your

296
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,740
environment is not completely protected

297
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,720
okay you can have some false

298
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,240
measurements okay some errors in your

299
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,950
computation so you better use error

300
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:46,570
correcting codes in order to ensure your

301
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:49,919
results will be good well how many

302
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:54,279
qubits do you need for serious purposes

303
00:17:49,919 --> 00:18:01,360
it's estimated by the the biggest like

304
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:06,990
IBM or Google that you need 50 cubits

305
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:09,820
only to have a sufficiently powerful

306
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:17,260
computer that is to say a quantum shift

307
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:19,779
that is able to to be more powerful than

308
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,870
the computers we have the traditional

309
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:25,269
desktop computers we have only 50 cubits

310
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,739
will be enough because you will be able

311
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:32,649
to do many many kind of computation and

312
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,690
many many kind of results explored at

313
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:39,189
the same time that's basically true to

314
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:43,710
the eight to the 50 power that's that's

315
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:46,000
10 to the 8 10 to the 15 or 16

316
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,149
possibilities at the same time only if

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,340
you have 50 cubits that said that limit

318
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:55,110
is called the content supremacy huh

319
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,970
because when you will reach this limit

320
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,139
we will definitely prove that the

321
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,920
quantum ship is more powerful than the

322
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:08,990
traditional shape

323
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:12,410
right and of course you need quantum

324
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:15,140
gates and qubits with a good fidelity

325
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:19,850
that is to say a few errors when you

326
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:24,770
measure them currently the error rate is

327
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:27,439
about 1% so you have 1% chance that you

328
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:30,740
have an error or during a gate or during

329
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,140
a measure that's pretty good

330
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,960
but not enough for a service computation

331
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:39,470
because when you have multiple gates

332
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,160
that are shamed and if you have only one

333
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:46,580
percent error rate but when you you

334
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,750
chain more than 40 or 50 gates you will

335
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:53,149
have 50% chance that you are you have a

336
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,380
narrow new computation for so for

337
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:59,600
serious algorithm you will have

338
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:03,460
enumerates that is quite important so

339
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:11,629
when a 1% error rate is not enough

340
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:14,270
really to do a service things so the

341
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,280
most important thing to remember is the

342
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,340
number of qubit is not the most

343
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,830
important factor right the most

344
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,290
important criterion the most important

345
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,290
criterion in my opinion is the qubit

346
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:29,899
fidelity that is to say if we have a

347
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:33,700
good fidelity rate we will be able to

348
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:37,760
have a deep circuits that is to say

349
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:43,670
interesting algorithm to run on it's not

350
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,230
a matter of number of qubits actually so

351
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,510
let's have a look at the different

352
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,330
content computing simulators you can

353
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,430
find all of them are free so you just

354
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:56,120
have to create an account and you can

355
00:20:52,430 --> 00:21:00,650
play with them so the first one is

356
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:05,000
quantum inspire quantum inspire is quite

357
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:10,120
a simple one okay you can either drop

358
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,480
your gates on a partition like this and

359
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:18,699
experiment or until the gates in

360
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,549
assembly listing an assembly source code

361
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,830
where you apply successively

362
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,740
the gates like the end gates the synod

363
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,110
gate the poly ex gates like an assembly

364
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,700
program so easier

365
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:40,000
the as the source or as a circuits has a

366
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:44,150
graphical circuits another one is quick

367
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,370
from the algaas up come website queer

368
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,650
key is one of the most advanced because

369
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,689
you can find all there are arithmetic

370
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,270
operations like the addition the

371
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,299
multiplication the division even the

372
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:59,510
exponentiation so you have high levels

373
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:04,120
primitives in arithmetic so you can do a

374
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,120
lot of things and the Otto has been

375
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:10,639
employed by Google because of the

376
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,250
success of the is tool quite interesting

377
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:19,940
tool then the rotor is working as Google

378
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:22,910
now and if you want to play on the go in

379
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,549
the subway on the train and so on you

380
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,610
can you can I can have a small simulator

381
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:31,490
on your Android phone but is to to say a

382
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:35,389
quantum circuit simulator which is

383
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,640
called QCs you can design and simulate

384
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,850
any kind of simple circuits with a

385
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,360
smartphone and have the different

386
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:48,740
probabilities the different measurements

387
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,860
you see here so for example let me show

388
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,770
you

389
00:22:50,860 --> 00:23:00,770
yeah with we squared yeah we're here

390
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:03,770
right you see here right so this is

391
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:06,560
quick you have the input qubit here so

392
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,410
two input qubits

393
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,879
let's apply another Margate to the first

394
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:17,570
qubits so as I remember the other

395
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:21,650
maggots will make the first qubit a

396
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:26,720
superposition of ket 0 and ket 1 so

397
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:29,690
equal probabilities of 0 and 1 for the

398
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,150
measurements right and if we apply a

399
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,110
c-note gate after the atom our gates

400
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,460
right

401
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:40,639
remember the C naught gate is when the

402
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:44,180
first qubit is true then negates the

403
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,540
serve on qubits right what happens so if

404
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:51,560
you simulate with your brain the

405
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:54,860
circuits so da da ma you will have half

406
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:59,149
a probability to get 0 and 1 so let's

407
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,100
assume it's 0 if you have 0 here the C

408
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,370
naught gate will do nothing ok because

409
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:07,969
the first qubit is false so we you will

410
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,360
have 0 on 0 let's assume the atom our

411
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,230
gates

412
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,479
gives you 1 then the C naught gates will

413
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,210
negate the so long qubits so you will

414
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:25,040
have 1 and 1 okay so either 0 and 0 is 0

415
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:30,290
1 and 1 okay and this is exactly what is

416
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:34,520
said here huh you have 50% chance that

417
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:37,040
you have zero zero zero percent chance

418
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,490
that you have zero and one zero percent

419
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,530
chance you have 1 and 0 and 50 percent

420
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,550
chance you have 1 and 1 so you can see

421
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:49,490
here both qubits we have the same value

422
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,680
even if we don't know the value in

423
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:56,990
advance

424
00:24:50,680 --> 00:25:01,750
okay now let's negate one of the qubits

425
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:05,710
with poly ex-gays right at the end and

426
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:10,190
you see now you will have 0 1 or 1 0

427
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:12,710
half the time okay and that's

428
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,930
interesting because that was a big

429
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:18,980
problem for Einstein

430
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:24,300
Einstein called that's kind of circuits

431
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:26,370
which is called the EPR paradox equal

432
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,220
that's a spooky action at distance

433
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,489
because if you have two different

434
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:37,970
particles that exit from this quantum

435
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:40,830
circuits and you put them very far away

436
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,170
one from the other for example at the

437
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,770
opposites of the universe right

438
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:49,800
they both behave at the at the at the

439
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,530
output of the circuits as particular

440
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,980
away so they both have the zero and one

441
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,870
value but when you measure one you will

442
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,540
instantly fix the value of the other

443
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,429
because they have opposite value so when

444
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,500
you miss your zero you will be sure that

445
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:08,900
the other at the opposite side of the

446
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:12,000
universe will be one and conversely and

447
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,870
Einstein was very worried about that and

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,650
called that spooky action at distance

449
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,639
but you cannot use that for

450
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,670
communication because you cannot choose

451
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,290
the value zero on one huh it's just a

452
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,930
matter of probability and you cannot

453
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:37,320
transmit any bit of information like

454
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:39,560
this right if you want to experiment

455
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,129
with more simulators you have a very

456
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:48,480
exhaustive list and quantity wiki so you

457
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,960
can have a look at this that one but

458
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,960
that's more funny to experiment on real

459
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,710
quantum computing hardware and now we

460
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,860
are lucky enough to have nearly a five

461
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,750
quantum computing public services all of

462
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,600
them are free now you just have to

463
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:09,390
subscribe but you can use them

464
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,850
completely free one of the first I

465
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,040
demonstrated four years ago was the the

466
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:17,189
Bristol University quantum in the cloud

467
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:20,850
which is a photonic quantum circuits

468
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:23,380
with only two or three cubits so that's

469
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,600
quite limited but that's in all

470
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,690
that's one of the first and that was

471
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,500
interesting to stress to test and to

472
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:35,520
experiment with now we have much better

473
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:39,970
100 Chinese have launched a service

474
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:44,830
around the brand Alibaba that gives you

475
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:49,539
up to 11 cubits IBM which is one of the

476
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:53,129
the well-known players in the area gives

477
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:57,450
you up to 14 cubits for free and if you

478
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:00,070
paid a customer you can have 20 cubits

479
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:04,630
riggity which is a competitor gives you

480
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:09,580
up to a 19 cubits and ever more than 100

481
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:11,860
cubits if you are paid customer and the

482
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,789
last one is d-wave so you probably know

483
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,070
d-wave but you waves is a bit different

484
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:20,830
because the waves is another a quantum

485
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:23,918
architecture you cannot do directly you

486
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:28,780
can implement directly content gates but

487
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:33,700
you will be able to create circuits that

488
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:36,129
will mostly do a optimization problem

489
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,559
that gives you what is the the bet the

490
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,970
worst value of a function and the idea

491
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,820
of value of a function of the lower

492
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,750
value of a function of our age range

493
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,820
basically it's for optimization problem

494
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,210
numerical optimization problem that is

495
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,580
to say for example if you want to

496
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,559
enhance your finance portfolio and you

497
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,320
will be able to do that kind of

498
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,299
numerical optimization using the wave

499
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,240
and the waves

500
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:10,720
claims that it has 8,000 cubed ships but

501
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:14,340
remember that is not a universal content

502
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,220
computer but just networks that do

503
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:23,168
problem optimization right and it had

504
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:25,539
this prune recently that both kind of

505
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:29,590
architectures are equivalents that is to

506
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:31,720
say you can make the same circuits using

507
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,870
a universal computer or an adiabatic

508
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,780
computer but you will need much more

509
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,969
qubits in an adiabatic computation

510
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:47,590
because it's less efficient for

511
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:50,290
general-purpose computation now let's

512
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:55,419
talk about cryptography because it's

513
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:59,920
very interesting area for quantum

514
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:03,280
computing we hear a lot of things in the

515
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,910
media about breaking cryptography with

516
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:13,420
quantum computing so what's the actual

517
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:16,360
situation let's see first how do we

518
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,040
implement basic p-box

519
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,979
operation that is to say basic

520
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:24,820
permutations key box is a permutation is

521
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:30,450
a basic bridge for many symmetric

522
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:32,740
algorithms right so how do you model

523
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:37,180
permutations using a cotton computing

524
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,670
using a condom computer sorry basically

525
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:42,730
if you have a complex permutation first

526
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,710
you have to decompose the complex

527
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,800
permutation in single permutations that

528
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,560
is to say in two qubit termination

529
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,200
because basically you can decompose any

530
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,149
kind of complex permutation in single

531
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,440
permutation in a composition of single

532
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:02,800
permutation of two elements then it's

533
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:07,300
easy when you have permutation with only

534
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:10,470
two elements that to get true to apply

535
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,600
them swap gates so it gets it's just a

536
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:17,140
permutation of two elements at the same

537
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,540
time so you replace all the the

538
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:23,470
permutation of two elements with swap

539
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,270
gates motor swap gates is not a gate

540
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,040
that exists for real in a

541
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:33,510
contemn architecture so you have to you

542
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,220
have to choose gates that are

543
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:40,270
implemented in hardware for real on

544
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,550
quantum architectures and one of the the

545
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,670
most basic gates that will oppose is the

546
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:49,200
c nut case remember and basically you

547
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:52,039
can replace any swap gates here

548
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,590
with three seanut gates that are

549
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,350
opposites like this with only three see

550
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,330
not yet you get the swept gates so you

551
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,639
can implement basically any kind of

552
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:05,908
complex permutation with only C not

553
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:08,519
gates quite easily and you can even

554
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:12,809
simplify under the wall circuit at the

555
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,880
end because if you have opposite C not

556
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:17,450
gates they get cancelled at the end so

557
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,940
you have a much more simpler secrets

558
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:25,289
right so it's quite easy to model any

559
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:28,139
kind of permutation and it's kind of

560
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:34,710
magic because every single gate remember

561
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:38,209
can be reversed because of thermodynamic

562
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:41,760
reason right so if you want to do the

563
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:44,190
inverse permutation you just have to

564
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,649
execute the secret from the end to the

565
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,350
beginning and you will have the inverse

566
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:54,600
permutation very easily so there is no

567
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:56,399
need to to think about the secret and do

568
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,610
the same for the reverse circuit you

569
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,830
just have to execute the secret the

570
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,229
opposite way and you get the opposite

571
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:08,309
permutation so that's very very simple

572
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:12,230
with content computing because basically

573
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:19,200
you have only reversible computation

574
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:22,049
right so that's the first way to reverse

575
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,289
a cryptographic primitive you implement

576
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:28,799
the direct function the direct operation

577
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:31,620
and you just read the gates in the

578
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,149
reverse order to apply the reverse

579
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,399
function on a given results but

580
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:41,279
unfortunately not every function is

581
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,370
reversible right so it's not that easy

582
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,130
of all time and sometimes you want to

583
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:51,029
reverse complex functions that are not

584
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:55,409
completely reversible and the other

585
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:58,650
solution will be to use an Oracle an

586
00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:01,900
Oracle is a black box saying yes or no

587
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:05,380
depending on if the result is resisting

588
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:08,409
for you to select good values among a

589
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,510
lot of different values find the values

590
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:12,820
you are interested in so that's

591
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:16,030
basically the two different approaches

592
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:21,340
to reverse any kind of cryptographic

593
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:25,510
primitive the easiest records that exist

594
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:28,600
is the Bravo Oracle the Grover Oracle

595
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,669
you just have to implement the function

596
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,489
the normal function and then to

597
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:36,429
implement a black box saying yes or no

598
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:39,638
is it interesting for me is this value

599
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,230
the good value among the other if you

600
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,179
combine your function with the Bravo

601
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:48,340
Oracle you will be able to find the

602
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:50,980
right value very efficiently for example

603
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:55,179
if you have 10 business card in your

604
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:58,470
pockets how many search you have to do

605
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:01,810
in average to find the correct one

606
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:04,810
tell me five

607
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:07,090
yeah that's alpha the number of business

608
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:12,250
card you have in your pocket because you

609
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:13,900
have basically 50% chance to find the

610
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,450
right business card when you have a

611
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:20,020
reached half of your business cards so

612
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:25,629
the complexity to find one business card

613
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:28,170
among 10 business card is 5/5 operation

614
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,080
on average that is to say it's an

615
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,490
complexity because it will depend on the

616
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,700
number of business card you have

617
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,399
basically you have

618
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,589
the same amount of separation then the

619
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,329
the amount of business card you have in

620
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:44,609
your pockets so that's not very

621
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:47,339
efficient Ravel record there's a lot

622
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:50,369
better now because gravel worker will do

623
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:53,730
the same among unsorted business cards

624
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:56,579
with only the square root of the number

625
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:59,730
of business card you have so if you

626
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:03,210
implement an oracle saying if the name

627
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,680
of the business card is Lipschitz for

628
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,750
example if you have my business card in

629
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,078
your pockets you will find it

630
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:14,869
in only the square root of ten searches

631
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:18,809
that is to say basically three searches

632
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:20,940
and not five and the optimization will

633
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:24,420
be better if you have a lot of business

634
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,990
card for example for 100 business card

635
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:32,609
you will find it in only ten ten tries

636
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:35,819
and fifty if you have to classically

637
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:38,609
find among all the business cards right

638
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:40,770
so Grover Oracle is very efficient if

639
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:45,150
you have to find the value of their

640
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:52,770
money only with the square root of N and

641
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:55,140
not complexity of M so as an example I

642
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:58,680
have modeled a simple function you

643
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:01,710
probably know which is CRC eight so CSCS

644
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,828
is not a cryptographic function but is a

645
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,380
sh function that not that's easy to

646
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:11,040
reverse without studying the the

647
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:14,730
mathematical properties CFC eight or CRC

648
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,869
sixteen is used for example in the zip

649
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,970
archives to tell you that it's not

650
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:24,329
corrupted or corrupted during the

651
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:31,578
storage or the download of the file it's

652
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:31,579
using integrity purposes so if you use

653
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:42,870
sorry if you model the CSC AIDS function

654
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:47,610
very naively you will for example find

655
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:49,890
this solution right which use only see

656
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:56,610
not gate but you have a lot of them

657
00:37:49,890 --> 00:38:00,330
right 9 12 15 18 21 24 is 2014 at gate

658
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:03,060
you can model the CSC eight function but

659
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:06,540
the problem is you have top of our EQ

660
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:08,549
bits here you need them eight qubits for

661
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,290
other inputs and you have eight qubits

662
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,950
in the output but the problem is that

663
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:17,250
you use eight temporary qubits you you

664
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:19,770
need twice the amount of qubit of the

665
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,720
function and you will not be able to

666
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,330
reverse the function because you don't

667
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,180
know the value of the top are a qubits

668
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,190
at the end if you want to find out the

669
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,049
inputs you need to have all the qubits

670
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,300
as the outputs and you don't know the

671
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:36,090
value of the top RI qubits in the

672
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:39,480
outputs to reverse the full circuits so

673
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:43,050
that works but only in the normal side

674
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,480
nuts in the river side because of the

675
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:49,230
temporary that qubits that are called

676
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,740
unseal a qubits and it's it's a problem

677
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:55,200
here to reverse the function so in order

678
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,259
to have something better I have used the

679
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,779
ref kit framework with rafted framework

680
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,450
is a useful framework to do reversible

681
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,890
computation and with this framework you

682
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:10,740
are able to input a truth table with

683
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:14,370
input and output and this rod which will

684
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:17,250
find you the optimal if it can optimal

685
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:21,150
secret to do a given reversible

686
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:23,010
computation and we are lucky the CRC

687
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:27,240
eight function is a reversible

688
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:30,630
computation so with a few minutes of

689
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:36,569
computation you can get these circuits

690
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:39,960
as an assembly listing that is optimal

691
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,460
huh you cannot have less instruction to

692
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,130
do the same things it's completely

693
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,980
optimal and it's also optimal because

694
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,320
its use

695
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,990
no temporary qubits no and celiac limits

696
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,290
so you only use 8 cubits to do

697
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:56,589
computation on input of 8 cubits and

698
00:39:53,290 --> 00:40:01,119
have results over 8 cubits right it's

699
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:06,730
completely optional here is the the same

700
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:11,800
circuits but much more in a graphic

701
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:15,160
fashion right so the idea is to here

702
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:18,580
sets the output of the CRC is separate

703
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:22,029
you have the reverse crcs circuit and at

704
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:24,580
the end you will get the input value of

705
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:28,780
the co CH function that is to say you

706
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:30,880
have reverse it the CRC 8 function using

707
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,720
quantum computing and what's interesting

708
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,630
is you haven't studied any arithmetical

709
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,759
property of CRS yet it's a generic way

710
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:42,609
to invert function you don't have to

711
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,140
study the mathematical properties of

712
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:51,970
functions it's a very general way to

713
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:55,089
invert the function so this is with

714
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:59,859
quantum inspire and if you do the

715
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:07,150
simulation here here my up out my output

716
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:10,509
is 0 here it's 1 0 1 0 0 0 0

717
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,670
I do the reverse CFC 8th circuit so at

718
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,720
the end I will have the the input of

719
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:21,340
COCs get that gives you as output 0 1 0

720
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:26,080
1 0 0 0 0 and when you simulate the

721
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:30,750
circuit you will have 100% of time the

722
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:36,340
good solution which is 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0

723
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:39,940
well that works now if you use not a

724
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:43,090
simulation but a real run on a quantum

725
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,880
ship you will have a bit of noise huh

726
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:50,160
here so sometimes you will find bad

727
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,590
solutions but most of the time like 90%

728
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,100
92% of the time you will find a good

729
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:57,070
solution

730
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,360
right so when you do come down

731
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:03,630
computation

732
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:12,370
it's useful to do many tries through

733
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:15,960
keep the the solution that is here most

734
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:18,580
of the time to cancel the noise right

735
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,100
for example on IBM come time ships the

736
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:23,740
number of tries by default is one

737
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,350
thousand so you you get the separate

738
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,410
executed many many times and you've you

739
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:32,380
find the made the major the first you

740
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:36,430
get you keep the the first results and

741
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:41,440
you cancel the other here's the full

742
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:45,609
program to a run the function on IBM

743
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:49,120
context IBM Hugh experience on real con

744
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:51,670
tomate where so you need the IBM q14 Mel

745
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:54,819
Blanc on tab ships which has fourteen

746
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,670
qubits right so you have the full

747
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:01,120
program here you have to send to the

748
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,860
batch queue of the quantum shift the

749
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,009
program and when you when it gets

750
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,890
executed you you query the results and

751
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,580
you have this kind of results so you

752
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:16,299
have the different tries with the number

753
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:19,960
of counts and you see the good results

754
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:22,450
among the first top results and you see

755
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,690
the our bad solution for example 0 0 0 0

756
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,830
is the solution with the is number of

757
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:33,250
counts 95 but it's not the solution it's

758
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:37,779
a solution with the lowest energy 0 0 0

759
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:40,720
0 so it's the first one but it's not the

760
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:45,100
good one ok so you have a few mistake a

761
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:51,069
few arose because of the the D currents

762
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:53,529
of the the quantum computation right

763
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:55,660
what's interesting is if when you put

764
00:43:53,530 --> 00:44:00,000
this kind of circuits in a simulator

765
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:03,750
here so this is the river CSH circuit

766
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,120
you can set as the output a

767
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,970
superposition of outputs and find what

768
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,680
are the inputs for that superposition

769
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,049
for example here

770
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,859
zero and one at the same time on the

771
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:20,710
first cubits here it's zero and one at

772
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:24,069
the same time and here also so basically

773
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:26,410
you have sets eight different values at

774
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:30,390
the output and you ask for the different

775
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:32,859
possible inputs right and you see

776
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:36,339
something that is very interesting here

777
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:38,680
so it's 50 50 50 50 so it's not

778
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:43,420
interesting but here you will see that

779
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:46,379
this cubit is always zero so you will

780
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,700
have the realest computation of eight

781
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,099
different circuits at the same time and

782
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,279
see this cubit will be zero all the time

783
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:57,430
this cubit will be zero all the time

784
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:03,970
right so you can find interesting

785
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:06,750
properties of function like this we can

786
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:10,779
do the very same than the the P box

787
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:12,910
modeling with the S box modeling right

788
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:16,059
for example if you take the S box

789
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:21,129
function of AES a bit more complex but

790
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:24,160
this is a basic substitution right and I

791
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:26,559
have found a good substitution with

792
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,160
norton gate so it's very small because

793
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,140
the the contem secret is quite complex

794
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:37,779
it's not only 14

795
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:41,680
gates here its 281 poly x gates C naught

796
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,770
and toefl gates right it's not optimal

797
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,660
probably huh because it the secret is

798
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:52,210
not simple so this is the simplest

799
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:54,970
secret for the S box of IES but it's

800
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:58,839
probably not optimal but this is one of

801
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:01,540
the best I found I've tested also fit up

802
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,990
to up to 14 gates so the optimal circuit

803
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:08,380
must have at least 14 gates and it's a

804
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:11,290
good a good thing that there is no

805
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:14,670
simple optimal circuits otherwise i'ii s

806
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,670
will be broken okay

807
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,399
you can do the very same with ads or

808
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,730
encryption okay

809
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,670
to break the encryption you have to

810
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:30,339
reverse the encryption so it's very easy

811
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:34,119
to reverse absorb because it's its own

812
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:38,200
inverse you can use an Oracle to test

813
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:40,839
the IR bits of the results to see if

814
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,759
there are printable characters printable

815
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,839
characters in the ASCII tables will have

816
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:49,150
all the upper bits set to zero so this

817
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:52,029
will give you a strong condition to

818
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:56,740
reverse exhaust function using a Grover

819
00:46:52,029 --> 00:47:01,349
Oracle left as an exercise for you if

820
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:06,970
you want so what are the threats against

821
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:09,160
actual and current cryptography the main

822
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:12,269
threat for symmetric cryptography will

823
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:17,220
be grover algorithm as we have seen

824
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:21,220
which is a square root of n complexity

825
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:23,980
so a Grover algorithm will be able to

826
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,828
divide by two any kind of symmetric

827
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:31,180
algorithm divided the key size by two so

828
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:33,730
for example if you use AES 128 it will

829
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:36,220
give you a symmetric encryption with the

830
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:39,960
strength with an actual strength of 64

831
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:44,470
bits which is broken because 64 is the

832
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:46,450
current record for a broken symmetric

833
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:51,069
encryption so Grove our algorithm will

834
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:53,549
divide by 2 any kind of algorithm any

835
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:56,950
kind of key size for symmetric

836
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:59,859
algorithms right so the solution is to

837
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,299
double or the key size if you have a

838
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:02,920
symmetric encryption if you use a

839
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:05,710
symmetric encryption you just have to

840
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,259
double the key size and you will be a

841
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,680
safe because we can prove that Grove

842
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:14,640
algorithm is optimal and there is no

843
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:19,390
stronger algorithm that will that will

844
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:22,000
find the key faster so we can prove that

845
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,859
is optimal so if it's optimal you just

846
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,339
have to double all your key size and

847
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,339
you're safe

848
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,569
it's not that easy with a symmetric

849
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,730
encryption because with a symmetric

850
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,190
encryption there exists much stronger

851
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,890
algorithm which is polynomial that this

852
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:41,050
time not in square roots but polynomial

853
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:44,049
that is to say that grows only with the

854
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:49,210
number of digits of N and not with n

855
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:51,550
directly and it's able to break any kind

856
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,860
of a symmetric encryption use in

857
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:57,370
polynomial time and it's called the SHA

858
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:02,350
algorithm and it breaks basically eros

859
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:05,310
ADSA ECDSA is EDLP basically any kind of

860
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:08,620
a symmetric encryption we use nowadays

861
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:12,120
for web browsing for certificates for

862
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:15,100
ssh connection and so on and it's use

863
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,740
quantum Fourier transform algorithm but

864
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:20,110
which is similar to the Fourier

865
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:24,069
transform you use when you do a signal

866
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:26,350
analysis so there is no easy way to

867
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:28,870
protect against these kind of threats

868
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,200
the best way to protect is to use post

869
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:37,150
contem cryptography which is a very new

870
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:40,870
field and post quantum cryptography is

871
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:44,980
the the kind of encryption you can use

872
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:48,460
to protect again quantum computing so if

873
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:52,390
you have a look at the the website qubit

874
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:55,690
counter you can find the current number

875
00:49:52,390 --> 00:50:00,279
of qubits the the current recorder huh

876
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:02,110
we have so now it's 128 qubits for the

877
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,050
Righetti quantum chips but you can have

878
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:09,030
a loop to track the change and the

879
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:12,100
effort in the quantum computing race and

880
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:15,070
if we graph the number of qubit over

881
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,990
time it's look it looked like so a more

882
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,780
law exactly like in traditional

883
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:25,600
computing because the number of qubits

884
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:27,760
is doubling every year or every 18

885
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:32,180
months and you see it's growing very

886
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:35,100
fast so this rate is coming

887
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:40,009
to avoid this Reds are basically six

888
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:44,490
different kind of algorithms that are

889
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:48,240
supposed to be a strong enough not to be

890
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:49,319
threatened by quantum computing so six

891
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,149
different approaches

892
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,880
ladies based cryptography motive at

893
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,350
Kapaa graph eh based code base super

894
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,450
singular elliptic curve is our journey

895
00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:00,720
and of course the symmetric encryption

896
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:02,850
is strong enough to resist to contemn

897
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,870
crypto to quantum computing if you

898
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:09,000
double all the key size so you have six

899
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:12,960
different families of cryptography you

900
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:18,090
can use instead of the actual of the

901
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:20,820
current sorry a symmetric encryption and

902
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,500
you have a conference that is called a

903
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,230
big cube cube so if you are interested

904
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:28,590
in these topics and it's the tenth

905
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:31,620
edition this year and I think it will be

906
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:34,640
in China and you can follow the Twitter

907
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:43,410
of it to be informed they don't have a

908
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:46,140
fixed website but it's a very very

909
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:51,240
strong area of research at the current

910
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:53,970
time right there are very few APIs

911
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,850
contemn cryptography algorithm and the

912
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:57,689
most well-known for the moment is NTR

913
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,339
you

914
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:03,570
it's a lattice based cryptography

915
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,900
algorithm and you can use for example

916
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:10,170
and here you encrypt if you want to have

917
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:15,450
a symmetric encryption and adhere you

918
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:18,660
signer for digital signature alright so

919
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:21,270
thank you for your attention and we can

920
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:31,790
take one or two question in the

921
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:31,790
remaining time any question

922
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:47,500
no answer questions everything was so

923
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:49,810
clear hello I have a question as we we

924
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,040
all know that a CRC ADA is a kind of

925
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:56,350
Hashi functions so what do you mean by

926
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,200
your the quantum computer to breathe

927
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:02,259
speak a little bit louder audience aria

928
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,339
I mean that other CIC ADA is a kind of

929
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:11,020
Hashi functions so what do you mean by

930
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:16,330
breaking the grch using computer quantum

931
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:19,440
computers yeah for seriously I it's it's

932
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:27,400
breaking is basically reversing finding

933
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:31,810
an input on a given output the input can

934
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,970
be very long not just one bad right I'm

935
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:37,990
sorry I don't hear you can you speak

936
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:41,290
louder it's noisy in the back yeah I

937
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:43,479
mean you have a very long importer and I

938
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:47,320
can you see I see a turtle katha one

939
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,720
beta and without here is the the basic

940
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,960
CR CH function that is to say that takes

941
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:56,379
one bite as an input and gives you one

942
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,780
bite at the output so that's the

943
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,260
simplest one but you seriously ice can

944
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:07,180
be extended to take much larger inputs

945
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:09,370
yeah but here the the demo is only with

946
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:13,029
one single bite because of the the

947
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:16,000
current capacity of quantum chips okay

948
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:18,580
it just G mode that's works for the

949
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
actual contentious but we don't have

950
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:25,870
enough power now to have much larger

951
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,830
input okay only you can simulate it but

952
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:31,450
you cannot run its own actual other way

953
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:34,120
another question about of the T wave are

954
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:36,720
we know the derailleur is quite

955
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,370
different from the security

956
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,899
implementation of quantum computers so

957
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:44,808
what - what does

958
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:48,380
number Oh computer number OQ Peter

959
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:50,719
in that you will mean mean IAM he's

960
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:54,469
either like the cubits and numbers in

961
00:54:50,719 --> 00:55:00,519
the security implementations I sorry I

962
00:54:54,469 --> 00:55:03,019
think I haven't always rather you use a

963
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:05,979
security implementation or quantum

964
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:12,049
computers there is a number of Q beta

965
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:14,629
where we use this number to to show how

966
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:16,959
how strong is computer years but the

967
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:20,029
interior is quite different from the

968
00:55:16,959 --> 00:55:23,660
security implementations and integrity

969
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:28,969
to however one solvent quantum Q Peters

970
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:32,299
so is it a so can we use this number two

971
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:37,359
computer to compare with the security in

972
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:40,579
brampton implementation all the security

973
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,259
I'm not sure it's very noisy at the

974
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:47,209
background so I suggest we we talked

975
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:49,279
outside there we can be much easier okay

976
00:55:47,209 --> 00:56:05,390
sorry I will just customer you after

977
00:55:49,279 --> 00:56:08,869
that it's lunchtime around speak speak

978
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:11,118
loudly so thanks for your talk and I had

979
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:13,939
one question about that reversing

980
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,949
hashing functions and I presume if there

981
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:19,249
is two possible inputs for the same

982
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:21,709
output you would get like both inputs

983
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:23,569
with 50% probability for instance but

984
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:27,410
what would happen if there is no inputs

985
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:29,808
at all like for a given output byte

986
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:32,348
there is no possible input that would

987
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:32,349
generate it

988
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:39,920
interesting I depends if the secret is

989
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:44,599
reversible or not it depends if the

990
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:47,210
secret is not reversible you will you

991
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,880
will use temporary qubits and cilia

992
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:58,210
qubits so you will have solutions but

993
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:58,210
with impossible temporary variables

994
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:08,299
otherwise you probably won't have any

995
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:10,400
solution that is to say only noise but

996
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:12,980
it will depend on on the circuit and it

997
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,480
will depend mostly if you have an

998
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:16,940
optimal circuit that is to say

999
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,559
absolutely no and cilia qubits during

1000
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:23,420
the computation thank you thank you for

1001
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:26,070
attending I will be available outside

1002
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,520
for other questions thank you

1003
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:30,679
[Applause]

1004
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,679
[Music]

1005
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,049
you
