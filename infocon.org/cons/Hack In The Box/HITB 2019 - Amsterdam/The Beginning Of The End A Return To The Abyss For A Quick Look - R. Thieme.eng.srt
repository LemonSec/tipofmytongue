1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,520
thank you very much this is the

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,170
information about me and there are

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,240
business cards here that have the same

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,750
information if you're a print person and

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,320
you like to take one of those whenever I

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,750
give these kinds of conversations I like

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,430
to think that I'm available to you not

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:39,739
only here for QA but afterward and I've

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:42,649
hid a slide and why this slide is not

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,669
showing up I don't know that one shows

11
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:49,730
up all right what the slide should say

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,350
if if you're really good you can see it

13
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,928
there

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,329
it's no wonder how complicated things

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:59,359
get well with one thing leading to

16
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,699
another and that's what's happened to

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,899
this space and that's why our life in

18
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,059
this space I'm not going to show you a

19
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,460
lot of slides but it resembles a mobius

20
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,670
strip I'm writing a novel right now the

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,889
hero's intelligence professional named

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,380
Mobius because he knows that down

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,270
whatever path you go you wind up on the

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,240
same Road coming back to yourself and

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,210
the conversation with yourself is the

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,229
most important one this is going to

27
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:29,300
happen throughout what is going to

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,160
happen is every time I touch the iPad

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,490
you will get a slide that is irrelevant

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,250
to what I'm saying that's happened at a

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,640
lot of presentations because of the way

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,560
the iPad responds very responsive but

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,900
the Mobius strip is going to remain on

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,440
the screen for a while because this is

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,060
what we're talking about I was asked to

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,220
do this in part because I've been part

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,400
of this conference for many many years I

38
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,370
think this is my seventh time speaking

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:03,290
in Amsterdam and most of those times

40
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:06,170
have been for gov cert four here for Def

41
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,940
Con Europe and the like and so I've

42
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:12,310
known the players in this field for some

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,920
time and Jeff Moss who founded Def Con

44
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,980
told me he says you know 20 years ago

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
when we started this when Def Con got

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,290
underway if you worked for the man you

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,510
were a loser

48
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,849
and then 10 years ago he said after

49
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,649
professionalization of this space you

50
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,849
know if you don't work for the man

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,659
you're a loser

52
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:36,730
and then when Jeff's old blackhat for

53
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:39,399
many millions of dollars and became

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,679
appointed frequently to boards all over

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,099
the world I could say to him and now you

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,590
are the man and that's what's happened

57
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,078
in this space and so if you hang around

58
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,319
and observe what's really happening

59
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,000
you become an example of what James

60
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,238
Baldwin said the price one pays for

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,060
pursuing any profession or calling is an

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,139
intimate knowledge of its ugly or dark

63
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,159
side another way of saying that is it's

64
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,409
institutionalized and professionalized

65
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,319
you remember what Timothy Leary said the

66
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:12,429
apostle of LSD once upon a time I guess

67
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,578
many of you are too young to remember

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,019
Timothy Leary but he was and he said you

69
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,840
never get the truth from the company

70
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,000
memo what he meant is what I've

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,790
confirmed when I go into a company to do

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,549
a talk for the Markinson consultation is

73
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,849
if you ask the higher ranking people

74
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,319
what is going on there you never get to

75
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,510
complete truth because they have been

76
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,518
assimilated into the culture into the

77
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,349
society of the organization into the

78
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,930
structure and it's kind of like the

79
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,220
invasion of the body snatchers that when

80
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,199
they open their mouth it looks like

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,750
someone you used to know but what comes

82
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,690
out as an alien sound because they have

83
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,810
been transformed by that assimilation

84
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,728
well that's what happens in this space

85
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,650
as well you never give the truth from a

86
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:58,720
company memo so I asked the people who

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,260
are lower down what is it like to work

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,849
here and you find out everything because

89
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,220
when you haven't been assimilated and

90
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:10,290
replaced your own way of constructing

91
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:14,709
reality with that of the organization

92
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,750
you'll tell the truth so once upon a

93
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:21,099
time there was a famous cartoon showed a

94
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:24,520
dog on a high wire far side cartoon and

95
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:31,450
if you remember the far side anybody

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:33,219
born before the 80s - okay a lot of

97
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,979
explanation of my references then

98
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:37,129
farside Gary Larson great cartoon you

99
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:39,558
can buy them in a

100
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:41,629
store and they're very very amusing and

101
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:43,129
he had a dog up on a high wire and the

102
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:45,169
dog was trying to balance and walk

103
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:47,929
across from one platform to another and

104
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,089
below the dog in the circus were circles

105
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:52,099
of faces everyone looking up and the

106
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,050
caption was something like high above

107
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:56,688
the crowd Rex tried to remain focused

108
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,399
but he was an old dog and this was a new

109
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:02,839
trick

110
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:05,029
my suggestion is truthfully the younger

111
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,949
you are and the less you remember the

112
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,409
history the more what I'm going to

113
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,259
describe to you may be a new trick in

114
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,058
terms of the grasping thereof in other

115
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:16,699
words to understand where we have really

116
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:18,740
come from and what has happened to the

117
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,499
space that you and your colleagues and

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,259
cohorts what we have all created it's

119
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:26,569
not what we thought we were creating

120
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,610
back in the day so I'm going to give you

121
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,339
a historical point of reference and then

122
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,589
follow through the work I've done for 25

123
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:36,709
years with the security space with

124
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:40,789
professional intelligence people and and

125
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:46,219
simply paying attention how many of you

126
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:47,568
know who Perry Barlow is ok one person

127
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:50,659
knows who Perry Barlow how many of you

128
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,729
know who the Grateful Dead are ok we're

129
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,329
getting closer who was the best lyricist

130
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:58,308
for the Grateful Dead Perry Barlow who

131
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,559
was he also he was an apostle of

132
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:02,329
cyberspace I know that word has gone out

133
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:05,479
of fashion but back in the day

134
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:09,139
cyberspace was a new word it was coined

135
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:13,099
by William Gibson in Neuromancer a

136
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,689
fictional account of a hardcore hacker -

137
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,139
which I will return later for another

138
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:18,199
reason

139
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,879
this is what Perry Barlow wrote and what

140
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,099
I want you to understand is that this is

141
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,199
what people really believed when

142
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:27,709
cyberspace became available the first

143
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,979
time we put ourselves into a web site

144
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:33,519
which was a brand-new thing I had an

145
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,349
early website and the USA Today

146
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,279
highlighted it as one of the websites of

147
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:42,050
the week that's how few there were and

148
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,459
the website was a brand new thing and

149
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,519
when you clicked on something I remember

150
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:48,919
the first teacher to put dissecting a

151
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,330
frog in layers of information and

152
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,030
visuals

153
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,890
you were in awe because it was a

154
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,349
breakthrough into a whole new way of

155
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,050
constructing reality which has become

156
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,020
habitual now we used to talk about going

157
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,310
on the Internet today you are not going

158
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,930
on the Internet any more than you're

159
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,660
going on the power grid when you turn on

160
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,060
a light you are but you don't know it

161
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,180
you turn on the light you plug in a

162
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,740
toaster you use an appliance but you

163
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,310
don't think of the power grid that makes

164
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,990
it possible in my day you went on the

165
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,940
Internet in the same way that my mother

166
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,690
would once say to me when I was young

167
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,700
sheesh I'm on long distance there is no

168
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,250
such thing as long distance calling

169
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,409
because distance has disappeared and the

170
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,540
Internet has transformed the ability to

171
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,970
get lost which used to be a mainstay of

172
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,310
mythical adventure because no one can

173
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,000
get lost anymore and we live inside a

174
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,220
pod optics pace which is observable well

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,410
this is what perry barlow said he said

176
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,350
governments of the industrial world you

177
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,960
weary giants of flesh and steel

178
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:57,770
I come from cyberspace the new home of

179
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,409
mind on behalf of the future I ask you

180
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,840
who live in the past to leave us alone

181
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:06,140
you are not welcome among us you have no

182
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,049
sovereignty where we gather this is from

183
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,849
a declaration of independence of

184
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,190
cyberspace and a rebuttal to the

185
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,340
government of any outside force

186
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,950
especially in the United States

187
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,539
interfering with our freedom online

188
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,000
without the consent of the government

189
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,860
and therefore he said you have no right

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,500
to apply any laws to the Internet I was

191
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:35,630
only 20 years ago and people believed

192
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,610
that wild LSD dream because it seemed

193
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,250
like we were entering a new space a

194
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,919
hierarchical structure of abstraction

195
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,410
that was somehow separate from the world

196
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,650
from which it emerged but of course it

197
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:52,219
wasn't of course it wasn't so hacktivism

198
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:55,040
evolved as well we were going to keep

199
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,710
ourselves anonymous on the web we're

200
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,520
going to use anonymizer x' we're going

201
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,850
to use tor we're going to not know that

202
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,829
the anonymizer x' were

203
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,860
created in part by the intelligence

204
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,319
agencies that wanted us to believe we

205
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,630
were anonymous or the obvious that

206
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:15,969
anyone who wanted to be anonymous was

207
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,889
someone who needed to be tracked just

208
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,690
like anyone who uses encryption is

209
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:22,300
someone who's trying to hide something

210
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,279
and becomes a much more immediate target

211
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:30,670
the same is true of Tor these these

212
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:33,670
mechanisms don't enable you to operate

213
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,849
in a trusted way because Trust is not

214
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,250
transitive on the Internet a trust bebe

215
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,130
trust see that doesn't work you don't

216
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,819
know and you know you don't know who

217
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,850
you're talking to what is trust I go

218
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:54,240
back to Lyndon Johnson how many of you

219
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:56,860
remember Lyndon Johnson okay my wife

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,279
thank you dear thank you for sitting up

221
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,139
front Lyndon Johnson was president after

222
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,170
Kennedy he became president when Kennedy

223
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:07,470
was murdered and Lyndon Johnson said

224
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,329
trust is when you have them by the balls

225
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,839
that was his understanding of political

226
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:16,199
power and and and that has turned out to

227
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,970
be true whether it's in cyberspace or

228
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:22,329
meatspace so we were going to get

229
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:25,319
information and disseminated in a safe

230
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:29,050
secure way or so we thought on behalf of

231
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:32,410
justice freedom and ultimately peace in

232
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,709
the world so how did that work out how

233
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,910
did WikiLeaks work out

234
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,869
WikiLeaks when it came into being was

235
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,730
going to be a harbinger of objective

236
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,850
distribution of hidden information on

237
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,579
behalf of openness and transparency it

238
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,220
was not going to be a partisan player in

239
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:53,229
geopolitical politics that were

240
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,899
inevitably going to get pushback from

241
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,870
whichever side you adhered to from the

242
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:02,259
other side so Julian Assange was thought

243
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:06,100
by many and still is by some to be a

244
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:08,470
great hero on behalf of that process but

245
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,680
where is Julian now he has just moved

246
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,269
from one cell to another cell and after

247
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,969
that he's going to go to another cell

248
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,830
why do they do that because information

249
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,930
does not want to be free

250
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,690
information wants to be used in whatever

251
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,359
way the people who have the information

252
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,570
can use it on behalf of what it is they

253
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,089
intend to do and that means the

254
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,519
technology you have created is dual use

255
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,790
and anything good that can be done with

256
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,720
it can be reversed and the reverse is

257
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:43,599
always anything bad can be done with it

258
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,370
so should we be surprised when Perry

259
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,260
Barlow said this was a separate world

260
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,600
and people believe the cyberspace was a

261
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,709
whole domain of existential reality

262
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,920
separate from anything we had

263
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,089
experienced before they were overlooking

264
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,459
something

265
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,550
they were overlooking that who who had

266
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:04,209
created the Internet it came out of

267
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,279
ARPANET our Pinet became DARPA ARPA

268
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:10,779
became DARPA the Advanced Research

269
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:12,279
Project military corporate academic you

270
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,890
know that it was created by a small

271
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:18,100
group of military corporate and academic

272
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,750
people for the easy and free exchange of

273
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,209
information among people who in

274
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,450
meatspace already trusted one another

275
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:28,810
and security was one of the lowest

276
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,760
priorities if at all a priority because

277
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,849
they wanted openness and freedom of

278
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,089
access and as a result when it suddenly

279
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:39,430
exploded and ported to a domain on which

280
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:44,589
all business all government transactions

281
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:47,979
so much was done without security we

282
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,630
have created a kind of abyss into which

283
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,820
we stare every time we go on the

284
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,010
internet of which the presentations at

285
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,850
this conference and other conferences

286
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,560
all over the world are primary examples

287
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,470
in other words it's full of holes

288
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,469
it is Swiss cheese and it is never going

289
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,920
to be fixed I shaved this morning with a

290
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,079
razor and the razor had a blade and the

291
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,689
people who put their money into making

292
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,269
good blades do not put their money into

293
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,579
the kind of genetic engineering it would

294
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:22,029
enable me to tweak my hair growth so

295
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:25,269
that I never need a razor they want me

296
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:29,870
to buy razor after razor after razor

297
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:33,200
after razor in a secure world

298
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,470
all of the fixes we try to do to the

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,210
internet to all of the nets to make them

300
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:44,690
viable for trusted communication are

301
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:48,590
subject to the same reality we don't

302
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:52,300
want to fix it because it has grown into

303
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:56,630
a multi-billion dollar business and

304
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,959
that's why we all here in this space can

305
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,550
have day jobs so we shouldn't be

306
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:07,190
surprised because ARPANET was the or

307
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,400
originator of it we thought it was about

308
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:14,270
free speech but free speech I've noticed

309
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,540
over my long life is valued only so long

310
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,400
as it does not become actionable you

311
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,160
know who Martin Luther King jr. was I

312
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,010
trust in the United States if he had

313
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,620
stayed in the pulpit of his Church in

314
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,810
Atlanta Georgia and just preached and

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,390
Sunday in and Sunday out people came and

316
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,479
said what a wonderful preacher he was he

317
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:39,319
wouldn't have been shot but when he

318
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,470
chose to move people to action when the

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,530
free speech became actionable he became

320
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,690
a threat someone who was more cynical

321
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:50,420
than I said devoting mattered they

322
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,070
wouldn't let us do it that was a rock

323
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:58,370
star Martin Luther King jr. no need to

324
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:03,230
shoot if he's just talking no need to

325
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:06,500
shoot me I just talk I don't do anything

326
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:09,940
dangerous so what happens if you become

327
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,620
a threat well what happened to Gandhi

328
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:17,120
what happened to Jesus what happened to

329
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:21,350
Nelson Mandela and now journalists of

330
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,000
all sorts are that's not supposed to be

331
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,290
there

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,090
journalists of all sorts are killed so

333
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,579
what was that we created when we built

334
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:35,630
this Internet I have a short story and

335
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:38,300
here's what I really will pop up that's

336
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,980
in this collection of short stories mind

337
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,560
games

338
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,820
it's called zero-day Roswell and in that

339
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,800
short story the alien

340
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,560
have come and crashed their spacecraft

341
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,089
in Roswell so that we will discover the

342
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,069
technology with which to build the

343
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,800
Internet and why did they do that

344
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,960
because they are bored going to cocktail

345
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,990
parties in Georgetown in Washington and

346
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,060
doing intelligence the old way they

347
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,160
wanted us to build the internet so we

348
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,650
could put everything about the human

349
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,270
psyche onto it and then instead of

350
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,800
having to work hard to discover who we

351
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,730
were all they had to do is download the

352
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,709
gestalt the whole and the story is told

353
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,530
by a professional intelligence agent

354
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,320
who's on his deathbed and he said when

355
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:24,199
you do a denial of service attack or to

356
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,350
face an enemy website we have to go in

357
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,660
and put put it back up what do I mean I

358
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,030
mean back in the day when al-qaeda was

359
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,360
the threat nicest wasn't I was talking

360
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,550
to a senior person at the NSA and I said

361
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,760
this is interesting isn't it

362
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,339
well-intentioned hacktivists vigilantes

363
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,410
keep attacking al Qaeda websites and

364
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,900
bringing them down and they're so

365
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,910
resilient they popped back up and they

366
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,410
looked at him with a querying smile and

367
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,930
he knew what I was asking and he said

368
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,959
okay those guys don't know how to write

369
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,300
code so we have to go in when

370
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,150
well-intentioned vigilantes bring down

371
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,938
their websites rewrite the code put in

372
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:08,089
defenses and put them back up in a robe

373
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:10,640
more robust way because it's much more

374
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,560
valuable to the intelligence agencies to

375
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,300
see for example where the antelope go to

376
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,698
drink water and then where they go after

377
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,339
they drink water they want the websites

378
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,680
up so they can do tracking of the people

379
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,629
who go to them and see who they who they

380
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,060
talk to because that's how you build a

381
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,150
map of the network you're contending

382
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,889
with so what looks like well intended

383
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:35,000
people doing something that was a well

384
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:38,080
intended thing didn't work my agent goes

385
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,160
on to say half the attractive outfits

386
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,770
attractions out there the most

387
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,210
attractive of them we made we have

388
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,060
partnered with the beginning from the

389
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,430
big with the big guys before for example

390
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,840
Cisco shouldn't have been a surprise to

391
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,760
anyone who was a starry-eyed

392
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,189
to know that every time Cisco shipped

393
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,200
routers they were taken aside for a

394
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,740
brief interruption while backdoors were

395
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,030
asserted

396
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,370
them and they were put back in the mail

397
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:05,720
when people wanted the destination

398
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:07,669
address to have that enhanced router so

399
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,580
that people could get in

400
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,860
we built remote access into the chips we

401
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,030
worked with Microsoft Oracle Apple you

402
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:20,510
name it from the very beginning I could

403
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:23,899
say all this and more because I was

404
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:25,640
writing fiction why did I start writing

405
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,880
fiction because I was working with

406
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,860
people after 9/11 mostly NSA some CIA

407
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,450
some independents who were very

408
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,070
concerned about what happened to the

409
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,140
intelligence agencies and what it

410
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,570
brought forth into the world for America

411
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,520
and the world and this is what happened

412
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,260
the director received an order from the

413
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,540
Bush White House called executive order

414
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,590
one two three three three and it said

415
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,540
gather up everything gather up

416
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,340
everything because if you're trying to

417
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,830
protect the entire interface of the

418
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,620
world as a friend said my job is simple

419
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,360
protect the entire internet that's all I

420
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,750
have to do from attackers who need to

421
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,100
find only one one way in protect the

422
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,780
entire internet and so when you're

423
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,610
trying to protect the entire Internet

424
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:17,660
you discover very quickly that you can't

425
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:20,000
and the NSA challenge the NSA challenge

426
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,390
according to a friend at CIA who said

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,750
this recently is quote the challenge is

428
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,050
how to destroy freedom in order to save

429
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,540
it those of you who know the history of

430
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,000
Vietnam know that we was there was a

431
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,580
fair famous saying after a village was

432
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,870
entirely obliterated during the war we

433
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,669
had to destroy the village in order to

434
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,949
save it well I was working with these

435
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,630
people to try to find an ethical

436
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,800
framework through which a return in a

437
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,480
minute to for how to do ethics in a

438
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,000
world that has been transformed

439
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,910
transformed by the technology from the

440
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,880
inside out and we had discussions for

441
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:04,850
about two years over that problem and

442
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,880
made up a paper that went into the NSA

443
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,129
into the agency as suggestive guidelines

444
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,299
for how you might think about the

445
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,660
problems you're going to encounter

446
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:17,850
in this world and a senior assistant

447
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,320
deputy director said to me in the middle

448
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,629
of one of those conversations you know

449
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,129
Richard you can't ever discuss what we

450
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,980
talked about in here you know that right

451
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,200
and I said well yeah he said well unless

452
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,610
you start writing fiction he's in

453
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,210
fiction is the only way you can tell the

454
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:36,000
truth no and so since he gave me that

455
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,860
trigger I've published 35 short stories

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,040
a novel and I'm working on a new one as

457
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:46,020
I said called Moebius I am encouraging

458
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,629
you to look at what is real look with

459
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,480
the beginner's eyes not assimilated into

460
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:53,970
the Perry Barlow like myth of what this

461
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,030
is hack Erdem is a magnificent play

462
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,679
space but whether intentional or not as

463
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,889
I suggested in that short story in a

464
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,549
joking way it is an observational space

465
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,210
it is a honey pot a honey pot for human

466
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:11,730
behavior in which everything about us is

467
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,650
rendered visible and you know that and

468
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,530
in my speech which is online a lot of

469
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,660
the Mara YouTube called when privacy

470
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,540
goes poof why it's gone and never coming

471
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,850
back I make the point that the

472
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,059
individual who had privacy from the

473
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,399
1700s on is no longer the social

474
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,129
construction of our reality because

475
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,130
other people know more about us than we

476
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,080
know about ourselves and therefore when

477
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,890
we operate from the inside out

478
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,710
as if we know what we are doing and why

479
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:47,100
we are doing it and all the actions we

480
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:51,059
can take our parsed and managed and

481
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,639
observed and then through AI and data

482
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:57,178
processing discovered reveal patterns of

483
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,980
behavior belief everything then we are

484
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,200
known by others much more than we know

485
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,460
ourselves and the electronic world we've

486
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,070
created has become a means of

487
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:09,150
observation surveillance and ultimately

488
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,770
more important prediction and control so

489
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,590
facebook says they're going to deal with

490
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,360
privacy by making it making your posts

491
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,459
less available to all your friends and

492
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,379
now only available to certain groups and

493
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,419
they conveniently ignore the major

494
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,770
concern with privacy is that they will

495
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,630
continue to gather up all the

496
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,590
information because that's the money

497
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,900
shot for them

498
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:33,030
our information sold to whoever wants it

499
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,940
so I'm trying to suggest that what we

500
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,310
have done is created technology that

501
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,960
transformed the world

502
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,310
Langdon winter whose brilliant

503
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,020
philosopher of technology said

504
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,419
engineering behavior through

505
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,100
technologies of communication have

506
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,960
created emergent properties of

507
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,350
ubiquitous connectivity that have shaped

508
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,040
social political economic and cultural

509
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:58,740
habits so individuals unconsciously

510
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,350
engage with this space and don't

511
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:07,440
recognize or realize what it enables

512
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:14,040
other people to know about us just this

513
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:17,070
week I noticed a AI can be used to

514
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:20,010
predict when you or anyone else is

515
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,220
likely to quit your job within six

516
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,230
months now you may have an inkling of it

517
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,730
but the people who are using AI to

518
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,700
determine by the pattern of your

519
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,550
behavior that that's what so can then

520
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,170
intervene in order to call you in and

521
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,520
ask if you're having any issues or

522
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,440
you're having any problems is there

523
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,020
something we need to discuss and they

524
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,060
can begin making strategies and plans

525
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,460
that are based on their more superior

526
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:46,139
knowledge of what it is you intend to do

527
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,720
in the future and that's just one

528
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,690
example let me go back some years ago

529
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,790
and tell you what we knew then dr.

530
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,430
Pentland the director of mi t--'s human

531
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:59,190
dynamics lab said we have a God's eye

532
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:01,470
view of all human behavior your phones

533
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,350
he said was big deal then your phones

534
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,360
can know and when they analyzed 16

535
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,610
million records of call date/time

536
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,469
position they could determine the

537
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,240
people's movements followed mathematical

538
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,040
patterns and with enough information

539
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,910
they could forecast their future

540
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,950
whereabouts with 94% accuracy for us he

541
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,010
said people like look like little

542
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,300
particles that move in space and

543
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,400
occasionally communicate with each other

544
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,629
we are turning society into a laboratory

545
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,460
a honeypot I say we're behavior can be

546
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:34,380
objectively followed it is not just

547
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,320
about observing what is happening it is

548
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,690
about shaping what is happening these

549
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,200
patterns allow us better to learn how to

550
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:45,480
manipulate trends people opinions in

551
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,370
math psychology so it's not the

552
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,900
propaganda manipulation and control are

553
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,580
new things on the face of the earth

554
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,730
it's that they have arrived at a level

555
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,710
of abstraction and the power is in the

556
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,040
hands of fewer and fewer people who know

557
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,050
how to do that and as you know when you

558
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,860
give them information about yourself

559
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,830
that's what you're you're giving them so

560
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,770
we expected the intelligence community

561
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,649
to be one of the hallmarks of this new

562
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:18,510
world and it is but not in the way we

563
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:21,780
expected there was a conversation in the

564
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,270
office of the director of the NSA in

565
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,490
which that liaison with the Brits said

566
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,920
we need to take special care of the

567
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,480
Brits some of you who work with

568
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,700
intelligence here in the Netherlands

569
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,980
know that you sometimes have felt that

570
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,990
same way too that you have a special

571
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,190
relationship and there are instances in

572
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,870
which you have acted as if we did and he

573
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,210
said we need to take care of our special

574
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,530
friends and the deputy director of

575
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,400
SIGINT or signals intelligence

576
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:53,610
interrupted him to say I'm sorry we have

577
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,840
no friends we have no allies we only

578
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,149
have targets and the intelligence

579
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,159
community as you know was set up so that

580
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,590
it could operate in all of the countries

581
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,760
of the world yours Israelis Russians

582
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,230
Chinese Americans everybody so they

583
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,210
could operate in the other countries of

584
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,420
the world as if they could disregard the

585
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,790
laws of those countries and I'm making

586
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,450
the point that after 9/11 that slippery

587
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:23,639
slope went inside America as well

588
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,950
because now the laws as they had been

589
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,040
understood prior to the technical

590
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,600
revolution did not apply in the same way

591
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,850
I gave a speech at the end of the

592
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,070
Kennedy of the Clinton administration to

593
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,129
the senior lawyers at the Department of

594
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:40,710
Treasury in Washington about what it

595
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,780
meant for their work when precedent on

596
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,280
which they based their reasoning and

597
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,580
case case studies no longer held true

598
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:52,700
because that transformational and

599
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,590
had created a different society and it

600
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,019
is very very difficult for us to grasp

601
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,639
what it means that we have created

602
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:00,980
something is profoundly different from

603
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:03,350
what came before in the same way that

604
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,629
the printing press transformed the world

605
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,980
in which it emerged and created the

606
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:09,439
possibility for the Scientific

607
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,350
Revolution for democracies for political

608
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:18,409
revolution and for things never ever

609
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:24,248
again to be the same heard me

610
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:26,480
oh thanks good to have friends all right

611
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:30,739
all right we'll sit with that for a

612
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,090
while it's very cheap the book it's on

613
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:37,809
Kindle you know I think I got a royalty

614
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:42,408
last month for six dollars and 32 cents

615
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:44,418
from the sale of probably one I just

616
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:48,200
throw that out there as a subtle

617
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:50,269
reminder that they are available so what

618
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,070
is it you're protecting cyber security

619
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,730
incidents and the risks that result

620
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,960
therefrom affect the company's financial

621
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,840
statements economics is the right hand

622
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,249
of God it's the money that matters we

623
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,869
can talk about privacy or give lip

624
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:05,690
service to protecting privacy and

625
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:08,269
transparency but what you really operate

626
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,950
on is how much is it gonna cost us

627
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,379
what's going to happen when there's a

628
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,889
breach the vast majority of successful

629
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:17,418
attacks today are using known

630
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:19,549
vulnerabilities in well-known software

631
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,190
that have been patched already by

632
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:24,379
software vendors so most of them can be

633
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,269
stopped by just knowing in your

634
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:28,488
thousands of machines what you have out

635
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:30,320
there and making sure it's patched but

636
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:33,590
you know about one third of the idea

637
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,259
states of the biggest organizations the

638
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,959
CIOs team doesn't know what hardware is

639
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:42,529
out there or what software is running on

640
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,799
it so how are you gonna patch that the

641
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:48,350
quote from one of them is I don't know

642
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:52,700
those machines exist or the software

643
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,649
running on those machines exists the

644
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,470
majority of businesses in the US and UK

645
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:59,508
leave doors wide open to attacks that

646
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,460
can potentially stop business operations

647
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:03,410
for hours and at the worst wipe out

648
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,890
billions of dollars

649
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:10,130
from the value of a company according to

650
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:13,130
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cyber risk is

651
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:21,200
the biggest risk the financial system

652
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:24,050
faces ok so what have we created what I

653
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,520
said a long time ago and I wrote a piece

654
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,820
for an intelligence journal information

655
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,550
security is one task both offensive and

656
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,020
defensive in the intelligence community

657
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,610
sanctions breaking foreign laws while

658
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,950
prohibiting similar activities in

659
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:39,139
American soil but simple distinctions of

660
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,540
domestic and foreign no longer hold the

661
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,130
CIA was built to operate outside of

662
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,830
America the FBI was built to operate

663
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:49,340
inside now the FBI is in the world

664
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,800
CIA is inside the United States because

665
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,300
the boundaries have gone down and the

666
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,879
ability distinguished foreign and

667
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,280
domestic no longer exists in the same

668
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,470
way so the convergence of enabling

669
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,350
technologies of intrusion interception

670
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,880
and panopticon bind with a sense of

671
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,889
urgency about a counter-terror

672
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,570
imperative and a mandate from our

673
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,240
leaders to do everything possible to

674
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,610
defeat an amorphous non-state entity

675
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,620
defined by behaviors rather than

676
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,530
boundaries borders or even a clear

677
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,050
ideological allegiance has created an

678
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,730
ominous but invisible and seemingly

679
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,649
inevitable set of conditions that

680
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,860
undermine all of the previous

681
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:31,340
cornerstones of law ethics and even our

682
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,409
religious traditions because religions

683
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,080
too are going through the looking-glass

684
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,120
of transformation this is a country with

685
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,909
both Catholics and foundational

686
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,979
Protestant denominations and the

687
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,320
Protestant denominations would not exist

688
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,510
at the printing press not generated the

689
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,550
possibility to create new identities and

690
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:51,470
then have the multiplied almost

691
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,800
cone-like except for subtle distinctions

692
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,030
from one to the other and we are going

693
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,379
through the same kind of

694
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,110
transformational looking-glass through

695
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,580
our religions and our politics and it's

696
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,320
one of the reasons why political

697
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,840
discourse in the United States is mired

698
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,810
in a 20th century framework in the world

699
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,990
not in the 21st century because we are

700
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:15,409
trying to talk as if nation-states still

701
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,480
hold the absolute uncontested power in

702
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:20,180
the world rather than transnational

703
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,450
non-state enemies where the alliances

704
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,620
mix and match in the trenches and every

705
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,390
time I've talked to people in the

706
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,520
intelligence community they know this is

707
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,530
what they're up against it's what kind

708
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,810
of deals can you make now with who on

709
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:37,580
behalf of the momentary intention and

710
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:39,620
goal of your process or program because

711
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,540
they know the primary goal of security

712
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,070
and intelligence work is to tell people

713
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,810
in the world that when they go to sleep

714
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,600
tonight they will wake up in a world

715
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:50,659
that is pretty much the same it is to

716
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,600
comfort and a 'swaj the burdens and

717
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,940
cares anxieties and fears of people who

718
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,810
have trouble grasping what it is that

719
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,180
I'm talking about

720
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:03,110
and whose cognitive dissonance as a

721
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,630
result raises itself higher and higher

722
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,520
but as Nietzsche said in the face of the

723
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,950
unknown which confronts us with fear and

724
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,960
anxiety the first explanation that makes

725
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,930
any sense to people regardless of its

726
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,790
accuracy is what people will grasp if it

727
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:18,860
comforts them and makes them feel better

728
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:23,930
and alleviates their cognitive and

729
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,370
anxiety so stability the persistence of

730
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,440
structures even while they're changing

731
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,159
the continuity of identities even while

732
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,740
they're changing all this work has

733
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,080
evolved and we are having profound

734
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,880
disruptions as a result and it is

735
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,909
difficult to talk about it in a

736
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,770
realistic way even in a small way

737
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:45,680
hackers dear hackers in the best sense

738
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:48,440
of the word and they created a economy

739
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,930
not an economy hierarchy of black hat

740
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,670
gray hat and white hat hackers and I

741
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:55,610
took a look at who were really in each

742
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,920
one of those categories and I realized

743
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:01,699
that a black hat hacker was what we call

744
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,680
a hacker and a grey hat hacker was a

745
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,050
hacker who put the truth down somewhere

746
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,780
but knows very well where he put it

747
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,790
and a white hat hacker is a hacker who

748
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,360
puts the truth down somewhere and then

749
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:17,570
forgot where he put it

750
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,969
hackers it's all about the tools and

751
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,040
techniques that enable you to penetrate

752
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,010
these complex systems which are wide

753
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,850
open and invitations for penetration and

754
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,620
it raises the

755
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:33,779
the question of ethics well what is

756
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,939
ethics look like there are real Dutch

757
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,970
heroes this name Freddie over sting and

758
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:43,169
mean anything to anybody

759
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:45,690
pretty over stigand okay at 14 she

760
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:48,750
became an assassin and saboteur against

761
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:52,080
the Nazis here in her home native

762
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,370
Netherlands Germany had invaded she'd

763
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,250
been recruited by the local Dutch

764
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,809
Resistance commander in Harlem he said

765
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,179
what you have to do is learn to shoot

766
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:01,918
Nazis I remember my sister saying she

767
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,110
said well that's something I've never

768
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,639
done

769
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,759
the sisters along with a woman named

770
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:12,089
Hani shaft became a female underground

771
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,819
squad part of a cell of seven the killed

772
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:17,069
collaborators and occupying Nazi troops

773
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:19,529
they staged drive-by shootings from

774
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:22,310
bicycles they lured German soldiers into

775
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:27,119
the woods where they killed them and

776
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:29,190
Freddie died at 93 and her death was

777
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,359
announced by the Hani shaft foundation

778
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:35,760
named after the third young girl which

779
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:38,279
had been started in their memory because

780
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,399
shaft had been captured tortured and

781
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,500
executed by the Nazis 18 days before the

782
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,888
liberation of the Netherlands at the age

783
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,929
of 24 why am i bringing her up I was

784
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,000
hoping I have to admit hoping against

785
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,310
hope with the absence of historical

786
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,159
relevance everywhere in the world today

787
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,049
that you know your own heroes because

788
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,690
what is the value of your heroes but

789
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:03,420
what the religious people call a Madame

790
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:05,160
nieces the memory captured and brought

791
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,550
forth into the present with such

792
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,250
vividness and power and palpability that

793
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:15,240
it lives again that those memories those

794
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:19,170
saints the hagiography the story of your

795
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,169
personal saints in technology in the

796
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:25,500
netherlands for your history must be

797
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,300
captured as examples in her case she

798
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,700
died at 93 but in the case of the other

799
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,490
one she was tortured to death as a young

800
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:38,910
girl count the cost and so if you can if

801
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,149
you contend with the powers-that-be that

802
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:43,509
have created this world

803
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,460
you know what happens to whistleblowers

804
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:49,299
how many of you seen here's one I bet

805
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:52,190
I'll get more hands Game of Thrones

806
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:53,210
okay few more Game of Thrones so what do

807
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,480
they do when they cut off somebody's

808
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,670
head like Ned Stark you put it on the

809
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,559
gate and then everyone who comes into

810
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,920
that gate knows what happens to

811
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,790
whistleblowers there's a law firm in

812
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,059
Washington DC that handles

813
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,920
whistleblowers and they they say there's

814
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:12,500
only one thing that will get you through

815
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,420
the courageous articulation of the truth

816
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,299
when you find yourself in a dicey

817
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,849
situation and feel compelled to tell the

818
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:23,119
truth and that is a conscience that will

819
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:24,410
not ever quit if you are motivated by

820
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,040
money revenge

821
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:30,290
anger any other lesser less are good you

822
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,009
will cave because of what the

823
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:36,890
powers-that-be do to whistleblowers you

824
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,530
count the cost and you evaluate whether

825
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:44,529
or not if your values are those of a

826
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:47,990
activist or vigilante or a real hacker

827
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,960
you evaluate what it is you can do and

828
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:54,109
how you can build trusted networks of

829
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,690
people committed to values that have

830
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:58,970
while they're changing have nevertheless

831
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,730
been the mainstay of the human soul the

832
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:04,279
mainstay of what it means to be locked

833
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,950
into our humanity instead of just being

834
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,319
expedient in going along to get along

835
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,000
the cost is significant the last talks

836
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,308
have done a DEF CON I've spoken to Def

837
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,369
Con now last summer last summer was the

838
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:20,059
23rd straight year the first year there

839
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:23,359
were 375 last year there were 40,000

840
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:25,010
it's a big change and I have grown grown

841
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,589
with that conference and the talks I

842
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,420
gave last year and the year before were

843
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:31,520
about what it can do to you in the

844
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,260
intelligence community what akun do to

845
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,170
you doing professional intelligence work

846
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,140
and what security work can do to you if

847
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,240
you are not mindful and vigilant because

848
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,180
of the ethical dilemmas in which you may

849
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,430
find yourself entangled if in fact you

850
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,190
have the courage to persist in those

851
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:52,549
situations and allow those ethical

852
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:54,290
entanglements to ripen and become true

853
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:55,970
in your life

854
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:59,570
so what you do with that will be

855
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:02,359
different depending on what it is well

856
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:04,850
who it is you are and what you can

857
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,070
tolerate in terms of what it is that you

858
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:10,220
have to do let me give you an example a

859
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:12,920
friend when I was putting these talks

860
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,290
together over 70 people at CIA NSA

861
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,840
military corporate sent me their stories

862
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:21,170
and this one is one of the most poignant

863
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,880
he was a senior scientist at CIA for

864
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,850
almost 20 years

865
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,060
he was very cover and he took a toxin

866
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,490
from the leaf cutter ant and a toxin

867
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,320
from a butterfly and a fungus from a

868
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,120
leaf cutter ant and a couple of other

869
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,070
chemicals that are best left unnamed and

870
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,180
he developed a procedure for destroying

871
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:43,400
the coca crop in South America the coca

872
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,410
crop of course is the origin of cocaine

873
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,720
and if he destroyed the crop then

874
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,819
cocaine was going to stop flowing into

875
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,890
the United States and he went to a

876
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,900
country in South America and tested it

877
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,819
undercover and it worked beautifully it

878
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,820
eliminated the coca crop and he came

879
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,040
back to get permission and they said

880
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,140
well maybe you better not do that

881
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,540
because that sounds like biological

882
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,920
warfare and we can't do that so he

883
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,690
showed them why it did not meet the

884
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,180
rubric or strictures for biological

885
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,910
warfare and they said well you you might

886
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,740
destroy the all the banana crops and he

887
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,210
showed them that they had tested it and

888
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:20,029
it didn't destroy anything no matter

889
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:22,520
what he said they said no maybe maybe

890
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,880
this maybe that finally he said it works

891
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,670
I've tested it why can't I do it and

892
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,180
they said just forget it and he said no

893
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:34,490
and they said yes forget it way too many

894
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,009
people make way too much money from

895
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,890
cocaine in the government for them to

896
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:43,010
tolerate their cash flow being

897
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,740
interrupted and he said let's be

898
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,890
whistleblowers then let's expose this

899
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,350
nefarious activity and the answer that

900
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,870
came back to him from his liaison to the

901
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,490
executive branch was I don't think you

902
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:58,520
understand what we're trying to tell you

903
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:02,149
shut up and go away are you are going to

904
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:05,839
be killed okay so

905
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:08,990
he left the CIA after 17 years he was

906
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,660
shattered in his moral authority within

907
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,999
himself because he thought he had the

908
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,740
courage to do the right thing you go

909
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:17,569
into this work you go into security you

910
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,240
go to intelligence because we are good

911
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:22,220
guys or gals doing good guys stuff and

912
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,598
then when you come back from a mission

913
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,910
where you find that might not be

914
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,740
entirely true as someone of CIA said I

915
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,249
have to go back to the trough for

916
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,709
another label of patriotism to try to

917
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:36,319
boost yourself up to believing that myth

918
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,210
again and yet once the myth has

919
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,690
unraveled the myth is unraveled forever

920
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:45,740
so what did he do he left CIA because he

921
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,960
was ashamed of himself for not having

922
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,859
the courage even though that threat was

923
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,109
viable to contend with what he thought

924
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:55,578
was the wrong thing I don't have time to

925
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,839
tell you several other stories that

926
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,349
other people have come up and told me

927
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:02,210
that corroborated that story this is not

928
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:04,940
fanciful stuff this is not Hollywood

929
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:09,289
stuff but Hollywood stuff is important

930
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:11,599
here because movies films are how people

931
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:14,890
get ideas into the mind of society

932
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,119
I had producers and directors say that

933
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,828
they said look you want to get something

934
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,499
in just like my friend who said start

935
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:24,769
writing fiction this is the candy that

936
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:26,868
makes it all go down easily and changes

937
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:29,868
people's mind so what kind of movies are

938
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:32,960
big out there Avenger and game just made

939
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:36,739
2 billion dollars why because it's a

940
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,839
comic book comic books and cartoons

941
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:41,599
excuse me full-length animated features

942
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:45,140
we used to call them cartoons are all

943
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,730
over the multiplex why go back to those

944
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,828
books that I mentioned in the first

945
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,759
place like Neuromancer by William Gibson

946
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:56,749
or Snow Crash they were all loner hacker

947
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:59,089
heroes and the purpose of narratives in

948
00:41:56,749 --> 00:42:01,910
which loner hacker heroes are the Stieg

949
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:04,460
Larsson novels out of Sweden in which

950
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:09,589
loner hacker heroes can in fact take on

951
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:12,339
the man and win is the fiction but it is

952
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:14,390
a fiction that sustains and supports our

953
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:16,069
self-identity because we want to believe

954
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:20,749
that as lone

955
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:23,209
heroes we too can do that so that we can

956
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:25,968
as Julian Assange said once we're going

957
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:28,098
to crush the bastards well you learn in

958
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:30,109
the gray world that we all inhabit that

959
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:33,529
the bastards are everywhere and they can

960
00:42:30,109 --> 00:42:37,609
include you and so things are not black

961
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:41,269
and white they are all gray and we have

962
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:44,839
created an extraordinary edifice that is

963
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:48,459
never going to be taken down as long as

964
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:50,569
it generates as much money as it does so

965
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:53,629
what happens to other people

966
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:55,569
the chief scientists at the NSA when I

967
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,940
was talking to him at a conference

968
00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:02,538
suddenly disclosed the truth of his life

969
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,119
and began sobbing and I held him as he

970
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:08,299
sobbed because eleven people had died as

971
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:11,930
a result of a mission for which he had

972
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:14,180
done the intelligence background and he

973
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,859
was terrified that he had not done

974
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,069
enough that there was something he had

975
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,328
left undone this work can get to you

976
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:23,209
when you find out that someone you've

977
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:25,880
recruited as someone at NSA did and find

978
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:28,609
out that they've been outed by some mole

979
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,099
in our own agency and captured and

980
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:32,959
tortured and killed well in that case

981
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,369
that individual just started drinking

982
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:36,680
heavily and had to be removed from his

983
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:38,749
work with clearances until it was clear

984
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,339
that he could get back on the wagon and

985
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:43,009
do the work and that was the only

986
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:44,839
concern they had at the agency is he

987
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:47,269
capable of doing the work not what does

988
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:51,049
it do to him so when somebody at CIA

989
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:55,129
told me I carry 24 suicides on my mind

990
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:58,849
and the latest have been senior people

991
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:02,449
at CIA who could not live with what they

992
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:04,729
knew a friend at NSA wrote now long ago

993
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:07,099
he said we got an email saying watch

994
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:08,989
each other and he thought what the hell

995
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:10,489
is that about so he investigated and

996
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:12,259
found out there were three suicides that

997
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,269
week and when he spoke to a recently

998
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:16,309
retired deputy director of NSA I said I

999
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:19,999
hear you had three suicides this week he

1000
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:22,549
said no we didn't we had six I'm trying

1001
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:26,660
to say the stakes are very high that you

1002
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:28,549
may find it an easier glide to find a

1003
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,480
niche in the industry that doesn't

1004
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:31,940
confront you

1005
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,310
with these realities but it's quite

1006
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,710
possible that you may indeed find

1007
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:40,029
yourself confronted and it's important

1008
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:43,910
for you to have some idea of what to do

1009
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:45,920
when you do we've been in this for a

1010
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:49,578
long time people forget Marshall McLuhan

1011
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:54,890
you know that name Marshall McLuhan okay

1012
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:58,640
one I feel like Rip Van Winkle honestly

1013
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:02,328
I went to sleep and I've awakened in the

1014
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,040
21st century and my points of reference

1015
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:05,570
it's like when I go to the gym and they

1016
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,890
put on the music and I say can you put

1017
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,369
on some music and they say oh no that's

1018
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:12,410
music I said no no no no those are

1019
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:15,250
people who can't sing they're shouting

1020
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:18,230
they're screaming its grunge it's not

1021
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:20,750
music and then I remember my mother

1022
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:24,800
saying oh god Elvis Presley the Beatles

1023
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:26,540
you don't know Cole Porter so it goes

1024
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,500
from generations generation McLuhan said

1025
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:34,099
in 1970 World War three is a guerrilla

1026
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,290
war information war with no division

1027
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:40,369
between military and civilian

1028
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:42,800
populations blowback is the unintended

1029
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:45,380
feedback loops and consequences to come

1030
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,770
when we forget that the individuals on

1031
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:51,970
whose behalf we are doing the work is

1032
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:55,040
also the enemy in fact because

1033
00:45:51,970 --> 00:46:00,649
operations aimed at the enemy blow back

1034
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:03,140
and affect the people here as well well

1035
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,869
that's a whole I just almost segwayed

1036
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,640
into a whole other talk but since this

1037
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,849
one is supposed to be winding down I'm

1038
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,660
not going to do that just face the

1039
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:16,640
reality of what you're doing here's a

1040
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,109
really good hacker who said to me even

1041
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,598
when we do our jobs right we're going to

1042
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:22,130
get owned the real challenge is getting

1043
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:24,319
business leaders to accept that reality

1044
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:27,200
and allow us to read the direct funding

1045
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:29,660
to programs that help companies deal

1046
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,569
with that another said the problem is to

1047
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:35,240
tell the truth you have to one not be a

1048
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:37,190
vendor because vendors are selling

1049
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,368
solutions to problems they can identify

1050
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:42,050
not to the problems they can't and they

1051
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,310
can't always sell what it is they want

1052
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,530
to sell which is the ability to

1053
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:47,150
protect your enterprise even though that

1054
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,590
may be claimed it can do all kinds of

1055
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,440
things but they can't give a total

1056
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,330
solution to protecting your enterprise

1057
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:57,500
he said not be a vendor and be willing

1058
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:59,540
to spill the beans on getting owned he

1059
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,220
said if we're gonna tell the truth you

1060
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,700
have to stand up and say I work security

1061
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:07,549
my job is to prevent intrusions we get

1062
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:11,779
owned a lot so I kind of fail at my job

1063
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:15,770
and sometimes it's really bad and here's

1064
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:17,780
how we deal with it in other words you

1065
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,940
start with seeing the world as it is

1066
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,250
with beginners eyes with a clarity short

1067
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,670
of mythology's that once captured this

1068
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:28,010
domain and made it seem innocent and

1069
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,860
serene it is not and you are going to

1070
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:32,360
find yourselves at crossroads and what

1071
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,820
is it that works according to the people

1072
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,220
I've talked to in all these domains to

1073
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,920
which I have referred you need trusted

1074
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,790
friends you can't do this alone

1075
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,010
you need trusted friends and for the

1076
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,810
ethical dilemmas there has to be one or

1077
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:51,020
two or three people with whom you can

1078
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:53,420
think through what it is the challenges

1079
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,540
you what it challenges you if it doesn't

1080
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,780
challenge you fine just do the job and

1081
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,340
sail on but you have to have friends and

1082
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,200
when you encounter these traumatic

1083
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:06,590
events you have to know how to come back

1084
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,569
from a sea violence was a medical

1085
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,790
ethicist at the University of Minnesota

1086
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:12,500
where I live now and he became alarmed

1087
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:15,230
at how many doctors seemed to be moving

1088
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,960
from tortured to torture to torture when

1089
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,310
we began doing torture again it wasn't

1090
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,440
enhanced interrogation

1091
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:25,090
we were torturing people and sometimes

1092
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,240
they died a friend calls them ups deaths

1093
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:31,040
you're working on somebody whoops and

1094
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,689
then you called it a doctor to falsify

1095
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,560
the death certificate and say he died of

1096
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,780
natural causes

1097
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,570
rather than the various things that were

1098
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,430
being done to him so Steve noticed there

1099
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:41,720
were a lot of doctors there and he got

1100
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,520
the material from the Freedom of

1101
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,890
Information Act thousands of documents

1102
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,290
all uncorrelated and he connected the

1103
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,960
dots who was where when and discovered

1104
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:53,090
that we were doing what we had kin

1105
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,890
insisted at Nuremberg was no longer to

1106
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,869
be done in the face of human rights that

1107
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,089
needed to be acknowledged and honored

1108
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:02,329
doctors were moving from torture to

1109
00:48:59,089 --> 00:49:04,190
torture and learning as they did and

1110
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:07,969
this is medical experimentation on

1111
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:10,339
behalf of torture and he wrote a book

1112
00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:12,499
called oath betrayed well I went to the

1113
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:13,969
AMA the American Medical Association and

1114
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:15,229
talked to the head Ephesus there and

1115
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:17,960
said what are you doing about this that

1116
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:19,819
Steve has illuminated so brilliantly and

1117
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,799
he said that's not our problem

1118
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:24,469
but Steve go organize people if he

1119
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:26,538
thinks it's a problem every avenue we

1120
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:28,339
tried the powers that be were

1121
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:30,710
uninterested in following out the

1122
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:34,339
obvious implications of that but what

1123
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:36,769
did it do to Steve he as me experienced

1124
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:39,469
secondary trauma from engaging with

1125
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:41,899
people who were traumatized and it

1126
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:45,319
changed him he would wake up sweating

1127
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:48,170
from nightmares he said he he had to

1128
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:51,950
learn he said to accept wait the

1129
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:54,589
beautiful in life to find beauty and to

1130
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,779
put himself in those places where he

1131
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:58,999
could live with the scars that he had as

1132
00:49:56,779 --> 00:50:01,759
a mark of his humanity I'm not

1133
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:05,899
suggesting an innocent path through all

1134
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:08,180
this thicket I am suggesting that you

1135
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,369
need to ameliorate some of the

1136
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:14,049
possibilities that could happen to you

1137
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:24,769
in this industry if you're not very

1138
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:29,299
mindful and vigilant this is what you

1139
00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:33,859
get okay

1140
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:37,369
I always have so much more that I could

1141
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:40,119
say but I won't oh let's just say that

1142
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:44,029
you need mutuality you need

1143
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,950
accountability and you need feedback and

1144
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:47,569
those are the hallmarks of any

1145
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,499
individual or organization that works

1146
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:52,880
the mutuality means don't do it alone

1147
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:56,988
find someone you can trust

1148
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,969
to talk through the sticky wickets get

1149
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:00,380
the feedback you need through frequent

1150
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,930
feedback looks into and out of the

1151
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,779
systems in which you work and ask

1152
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:08,118
yourself where your limits are we all

1153
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:10,580
are compromising as Jeff Moss

1154
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:14,570
illustrated in those decade-long

1155
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:16,069
some informational trajectories from not

1156
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:19,160
working for the man to working for the

1157
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:22,160
man to being the man that's just what

1158
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,899
growing up can involve but there can be

1159
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,750
ethical dilemmas to confront you with

1160
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,190
soul searing moral harms and that's all

1161
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,750
I'm encouraging you to do is recognize

1162
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:32,270
that that's a possibility

1163
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,130
stare into the abyss and do not allow it

1164
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:37,720
to stare back into your own soul

1165
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:40,910
there are ameliorating possibilities and

1166
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:47,330
at this point I will say does anybody

1167
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:51,520
have a question all right let me change

1168
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:51,520
that then anybody got a question

1169
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:59,480
questions back there no no all of us

1170
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,070
thank you very much for your

1171
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:09,970
presentation and then my question was

1172
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:09,970
indeed if there are any questions yes so

1173
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,620
I don't know I am old and long in tooth

1174
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:21,140
and if we walk into it's only four

1175
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:24,259
minutes from here Dylan said if we walk

1176
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,270
into the party and it is so loud with

1177
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:31,030
head banging music because that's what

1178
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:34,940
young people like then not for long

1179
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:38,620
but if it's a melodic you know Moon

1180
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:41,420
River Andy Williams something like that

1181
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:44,540
we may see we may stop in I don't know

1182
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,670
but I am available you know through

1183
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:50,090
Twitter and online and email and

1184
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:52,910
messaging and messenger and on and on

1185
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,800
and LinkedIn and Facebook take a card

1186
00:52:52,910 --> 00:53:00,500
it has all the information you'll need

1187
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:02,600
and I do make myself available for

1188
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,180
anybody who has a result of any of the

1189
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,799
conversations like this that we have

1190
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:09,319
wants to follow up when something does

1191
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:13,940
occur to them when a conversation would

1192
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:15,800
be helpful I'm around so it may not be

1193
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,680
at the party but it's available through

1194
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,780
all these electronic means and as a

1195
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,930
friend at NSA said when I was going to

1196
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,500
call him about some dicey thing he said

1197
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,690
you

1198
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,890
- wireline it'll take them about three

1199
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:35,650
or four seconds longer all right so be

1200
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,650
aware that we live inside a panopticon

1201
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:48,950
our conduct these conversations okay

1202
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:51,080
thank you yeah question yeah it's a it's

1203
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,629
an extremely small group of people that

1204
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,940
are controlling the press now and

1205
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,780
they're talking with another small group

1206
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,590
of people who are controlling the

1207
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:02,750
governments so you mentioned some young

1208
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:05,810
people from here with a woman who died

1209
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:08,120
aged 24 and the woman whose colleague

1210
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:12,710
who died 93 and nobody seemed to know

1211
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:15,009
about her is there any way of us hanging

1212
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,990
together protecting each other and

1213
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:21,320
avoiding what might come from those

1214
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:25,640
people in charge or are we just you know

1215
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:28,210
in the meat chopper already any other

1216
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,210
questions

1217
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:36,799
that's that's it that's the question and

1218
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,959
it doesn't have an easy answer before

1219
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,630
WikiLeaks someone I knew here said

1220
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,520
didn't have a name yet he said it's not

1221
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,780
working to do the hecta vism we've been

1222
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,580
doing we're gonna have to be a little

1223
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,220
more active we'd have to go get some

1224
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:50,450
stuff and he wanted to tell me that he

1225
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,310
wanted to tell me what was coming now

1226
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,830
I'm coming to Amsterdam this is what he

1227
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:57,110
said I'll meet you at the Central

1228
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,580
Station ride with you down to the hague

1229
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:01,310
or the Rotterdam wherever I was doing a

1230
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:03,290
speech then and then we got off the

1231
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,990
train and we walked around in a crowd

1232
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:07,460
where no one could overhear us and he

1233
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:10,279
told me what was coming and then he got

1234
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:13,940
back on the train he felt that that kind

1235
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:17,360
of activity was necessary or the fellow

1236
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:19,250
with DEFCON who I knew well and we

1237
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,500
talked about his work it was very sexy

1238
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,820
very cool work but then he connected

1239
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,080
with NSA he said I signed the agreement

1240
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,360
I can't talk to you anymore

1241
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,580
that's okay that's fine and about six

1242
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,070
years later at DEFCON he said I've got

1243
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,720
to talk to you so we he insisted we'd

1244
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,910
leave the conference walked down the

1245
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,970
strip in Vegas with his hordes of people

1246
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,399
sit on the steps

1247
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,950
of a mall with people streaming by so he

1248
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,240
wouldn't be overheard and he said you

1249
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,950
familiar with particularly named a

1250
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,270
terrorist incident I said sure he said

1251
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:48,520
what do you think happened I told him

1252
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,500
what I thought happened he said that's

1253
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,259
not what happened I said what happened

1254
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,369
he said he told me what happened I was

1255
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,200
stunned

1256
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:57,910
why was I stunned because he had pulled

1257
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,339
the cornerstone out from under my

1258
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:02,230
construction of reality and what he told

1259
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,520
me said to me that I thought I was smart

1260
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,500
enough to know what was going on I

1261
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,020
didn't have any idea and that called

1262
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,400
into question everything I thought and I

1263
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,640
said how do you know this and he said

1264
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,770
because I did it and if you tell anybody

1265
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,390
that I told you or put it in one of your

1266
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:19,390
short stories because fiction is ba ba

1267
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:22,060
ba I could be killed but I had to get it

1268
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:25,480
off my chest so now I'm carrying it

1269
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:28,119
right he understood that that method of

1270
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,460
communication was the only one we could

1271
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:32,230
trust and he trusted me it may be

1272
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,000
obvious or you know from my history that

1273
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,930
I was in Piscopo clergymen a priest for

1274
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,030
16 years

1275
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:38,379
and that has been the basis of a lot of

1276
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,810
the relationships I've had with these

1277
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:44,740
people and they trust me to hold and

1278
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:47,619
confidence what I am told and there are

1279
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:50,950
consequences for me of that in my work

1280
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:52,510
but nothing dire and I stick with

1281
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,330
fiction but I also hold these

1282
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:59,080
confidences and help people once in a

1283
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:02,650
while be able to do the right thing

1284
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:05,770
without without suffering for it small

1285
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:09,280
very very very small with very little

1286
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:11,970
impact because look at China look at the

1287
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,830
massive control system and the

1288
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:16,990
authoritarian governments that here in

1289
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:19,960
Europe are gaining more and more and

1290
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:22,330
more power and look at the idiocy we

1291
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,880
have going on in the United States no

1292
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:28,210
one knowing their right mind dreamed

1293
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:34,180
that a third or a fourth of the American

1294
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:35,830
people or half could entertain the that

1295
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,730
we couldn't grasp the willingness to

1296
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:41,650
enter a cult a cultic reality where you

1297
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,540
can ignore the reality of what's in

1298
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,369
front of your own eyes I mean so this is

1299
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,500
these are serious questions and it's a

1300
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,770
dare world so in the case of the one I

1301
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,190
brought up from

1302
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:54,410
Netherlands you were occupied some chose

1303
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:56,540
one way to go and some chose another

1304
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:58,910
that was not easy and you had to

1305
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,640
ultimately forgive people who who chose

1306
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:04,339
expediency and to live rather than risk

1307
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:06,129
being killed so the cost for the one was

1308
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:10,160
to be tortured death but for the other

1309
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:12,260
she accomplished what she could and I am

1310
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,790
old enough to know that what we think we

1311
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,530
can accomplish when we're young is not

1312
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,210
anywhere near what we wind up looking

1313
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:20,090
back and saying what was all that about

1314
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:24,890
and yet if you don't do what you can do

1315
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:26,090
I was a rabbi who said you know if if

1316
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:30,980
you're not for yourself

1317
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:33,530
oh who will be but if you're only for

1318
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,270
yourself what are you and if not now

1319
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,670
when

1320
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:40,460
so it is identifying in the flesh those

1321
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,460
on whom you can reasonably expect to

1322
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:45,230
trust the account when you I mean one

1323
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,000
the person I mentioned said you gotta

1324
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,690
have a friends this is deputy director

1325
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,010
of the NSA who was in a program that he

1326
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,050
questioned the people have talked with

1327
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,990
CIA they financed us heading programs

1328
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,860
that one called up he said this is the

1329
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,259
apocalypse

1330
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:03,350
he was an evangelical Christian he said

1331
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,340
this is the end times if I do this and

1332
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,680
he said what should I do

1333
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:09,530
and as a clergyman you learn you can't

1334
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,910
tell somebody else and what to do we

1335
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:13,100
could talk it through and we did for a

1336
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:14,299
full hour and he said I'm not sure what

1337
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,670
did I say you know what to do and he

1338
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:20,810
said sometimes knowing what to do is

1339
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:24,430
much harder than doing it when you once

1340
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:27,970
once you know what it is the doing is

1341
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:32,870
easier than struggling through those

1342
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:34,759
very thorny thickets to determine where

1343
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:38,440
are your limits what am i capable of

1344
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:41,720
doing can I live with myself if I don't

1345
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,460
so we find ways to trust other people

1346
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,259
for me it helps that I go all around the

1347
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,610
world and have developed a trusted

1348
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:48,950
network with whom I can have quiet

1349
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:52,850
conversations and they're people I've

1350
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:55,220
honest-to-god loved I love them and

1351
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:58,850
ultimately love is

1352
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:02,299
what redeems us because the alternatives

1353
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:04,160
are all lesser than that so you try to

1354
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:07,310
find out what is your highest value what

1355
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,649
does love look like for you and how do I

1356
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:11,390
live out of that and how do I build a

1357
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:12,500
structure a system that has mutuality

1358
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:14,359
with the right people

1359
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,220
sufficient feedback so I don't go off

1360
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:18,380
and that's what my friend at NSA said he

1361
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,330
said without their feedback I would not

1362
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,100
have been able to work my way through to

1363
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,810
how to protect the American people for

1364
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,279
an intrusion and surveillance at the

1365
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:27,920
same time we had to implement some of

1366
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,250
these very very difficult programs so we

1367
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,860
didn't quit the agency he's a hero but

1368
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:35,450
he did what he could to determine how to

1369
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,430
protect the American people the best way

1370
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,939
possible and and the successes are

1371
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:43,549
always partial there they're never

1372
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:49,610
complete and I wish I had a better nurse

1373
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:51,440
better answer I don't but you know what

1374
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,870
it means to love somebody you've loved

1375
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,180
and you've been loved and you know in

1376
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:58,730
those contexts what it is that you're

1377
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,980
called forth to do sometimes by

1378
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:03,650
circumstances and that is the template

1379
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:07,640
to which we have to refer when we're in

1380
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:09,680
those more difficult spots thank you so

1381
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,009
much for your question please give a

1382
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,098
warm round of applause

1383
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:16,099
[Applause]

1384
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,820
you
