1
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,960
hello everyone first of all I'm very

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,950
grateful for the even hit with the heavy

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,180
beats the topic I share today is the

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:36,989
other out of the Windows kernel first

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:41,010
okay let's begin okay

6
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,500
this ain't made agender man servers in

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,050
2000 and something about the windows

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,580
Connors first at the framework October

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,879
the fat resolves about another bill as

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:57,599
the case the next generation file system

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,440
and the old fellow back to a spot and

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,970
the conclusion and further work as a

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,970
last question NASA

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,580
so as first let placed me to introduce

15
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,179
myself

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,259
I'm from and from things in the channel

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,390
lab I'm a researcher and focus on

18
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,200
Windows Connor especially the local

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:30,090
parody description this is my dinner

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,510
main chase my jeez it was it was engine

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:42,540
when the baby a research and may well

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:46,140
analyze okay Duvall is that we must we

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,740
must know well although other is what

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,939
allow our cause our cause is very very

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:02:01,169
very smoke how cause a to fan many many

26
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:05,990
colonel whether it is yes and then what

27
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:10,769
other all the way in let me tick wet

28
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:16,579
take a look at the main target in lot in

29
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:21,840
the last year we met being packet is the

30
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:25,860
windows windows object that's like a GDI

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,099
objects as lag a TCP Graham the pallid

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,819
Argentine impress and pest and under

33
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:36,390
some some user user object

34
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,950
just like the desktop menu icon

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:45,839
okay senator table or window all the

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:48,899
other other system objects mmm actually

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,790
we aimed any possible object on the

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,670
windows this there's the tangle mode

39
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,290
yeah

40
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,920
[Music]

41
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:04,159
and this is something about fighting the

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,418
fighting is the automatic software

43
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:14,129
testing technology we need we needed

44
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:19,769
invade and expected all random data use

45
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:24,810
data input when you know a model monitor

46
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:29,639
to monitor to monitor to target the

47
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,540
program from the crisis and and the most

48
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:37,079
imposing important thing is to how to

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:43,168
generate generates a random new input

50
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:54,449
and oppose the random input food bank

51
00:03:43,169 --> 00:04:00,900
knee or manually okay okay this is a

52
00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:04,430
simple simple framework octet ER as

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,430
firstly we need a script

54
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:13,769
my fathom fathom from walk is right and

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:19,380
by my passion not now the registry we

56
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:24,860
need a we need a red Tyson we need red

57
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,860
resin and we need the test cases and

58
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:37,759
Munira fashion server and and the thumb

59
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:42,919
corrector and our free remote from work

60
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,729
nature Ignacio is easily we report out

61
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:54,409
Bo yeah

62
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:57,020
is that this is a framework at first you

63
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,840
must you must be needed squirty

64
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,750
researcher you must need a researcher

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:08,750
and the several pc pc machines and and a

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,250
monitor monitor to collect collect the

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:18,500
baggage baggage to the to the to the

68
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:23,080
server and and the risotto is response

69
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:28,340
for writing the squibs so further

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:33,529
fighting scripts as a scrape the way of

71
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:37,969
generate generated many many fats cases

72
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:41,539
and and the pushed on input of array

73
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:45,740
every possible first machine under the

74
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:49,460
monitor will real clever the bag to

75
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:58,310
connect the back and into our love is

76
00:05:49,460 --> 00:06:01,299
over of course we needed rather we

77
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:08,690
needed to revs down some fast locks and

78
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:15,860
to help us hamas improve our fast okay

79
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:25,279
here is how how how the kind of remote

80
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:29,360
who works with the systems that if you

81
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,849
run a monitor to preventable normal a

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,360
situation english in first system and

83
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:38,610
the restart restart

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:45,330
and the risk that the system

85
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:48,360
particularly arrey arrey feminist at the

86
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:53,280
certainly the system you will will be

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,670
rebuilt it will update the latest the

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,359
fascists equipped mmm

89
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:04,200
fast fast reality and when the system

90
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,940
will generate that policy template and

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:14,430
the test case and the fat machine we all

92
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:23,090
will run when when they as fast as fast

93
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:27,750
graves and if we offend a certain class

94
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:33,859
the first from a worker will applaud the

95
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:40,320
log and the class comp and it will Co

96
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:43,830
test the script yes here here is the how

97
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:49,830
to fend the target target the faggins if

98
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:54,719
we want to fast we must know the target

99
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,750
marketing target affections offenders in

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,940
a very very simple way to send the

101
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:05,730
target functions you can use the tool

102
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:09,330
it's called windbg you can use them in

103
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:14,070
gbg you can use the command X and you

104
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:17,909
can find many many functions you can

105
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,240
choose chose some of them your interest

106
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,240
to you

107
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:36,049
here is the the factions here's a

108
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:41,990
magazine kiss me the father the

109
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:45,979
Ferguson's the father says the the left

110
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:53,209
functions is a fall trade for trade for

111
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:56,480
generate various objects that's like the

112
00:08:53,209 --> 00:09:00,050
first one is for create create DC the

113
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,910
National I fell create a bitmap and the

114
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:08,560
set say Nestle the paid a gene and the

115
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:18,740
color and the pin you can so you can

116
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:20,149
generate many objects this the second

117
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,350
that the middle one made the one

118
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:29,029
functions is is for photo photo operates

119
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:31,279
and when you want to fast further I'll

120
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:34,220
protect you

121
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,300
yourself you so collect all other

122
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:45,610
functions also say a beast tangled

123
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:50,589
objects the solo one in the red is

124
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:58,699
itself a curtains for for destroy or

125
00:09:50,589 --> 00:10:03,079
delete for destroy destroy or object so

126
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:09,170
so in fact from work your soul your soul

127
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:13,989
created create object first and correct

128
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:21,260
the target of function associated with

129
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:23,270
touch the objects and and the the the

130
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,830
function of

131
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:30,319
destroying the table dance and the and

132
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,860
the default from work will help you

133
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,770
makes next or makes them make the all

134
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,040
all the focuses all the functions you

135
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:44,209
know re you know in person you know rate

136
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:48,730
you can call any any person's off of

137
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:58,579
them and they're randomly and they

138
00:10:48,730 --> 00:11:02,089
repeatedly if you're lucky enough you

139
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:06,800
will you will you will run the fast from

140
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:11,779
work for for awake or mass it will

141
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:20,449
offend the system is strong it's born of

142
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:25,390
the system Isis is cross this if you not

143
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:29,899
like enough you should also add other

144
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:44,779
out of the factions and here you can

145
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:49,190
find a federal system class ok taste a

146
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:54,920
state first script federated symbol so

147
00:11:49,190 --> 00:12:01,329
you can the first layer DC the secondary

148
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:04,099
surface and the sole one is a gene so so

149
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,699
when you want to fast II see you at

150
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,820
first

151
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,000
you're sure to collect all the other

152
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:18,310
operations all associated associated

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:25,279
with DC object and save them children to

154
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:29,770
array a person has an array and as I

155
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,770
could the other other objects

156
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:40,660
so so you can you can call them randomly

157
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:49,300
and pick pick any anyone any function

158
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:57,010
from the array then here the first

159
00:12:49,300 --> 00:13:01,899
without summarize about 10 to 20 crisis

160
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:07,439
here in a year in the last year but a

161
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:15,970
lot of non-reportable crises and some of

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:19,120
non difference pointers and and and the

163
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:24,640
Nesta is the crosstab offended the

164
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:28,589
session we will pool and commode is

165
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,610
represent of handle the session not

166
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:41,440
session well has really special and

167
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:47,220
another pitfall here is it's very

168
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:53,620
effective crisis summarize and I found 3

169
00:13:47,220 --> 00:14:00,209
to 4 UF and 2 to 3 in the Agora flow and

170
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:09,180
to rest condition and non difference

171
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:20,010
here is a POC POC for TE 2000 by 8 and 8

172
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:26,229
136 you can see the POC class class

173
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:31,589
class of the added faction GDI GDI GDI

174
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:35,850
Ferguson and the POC is reproducible by

175
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,850
better person object

176
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,950
[Music]

177
00:14:51,830 --> 00:15:01,890
and here is the fats fats result under

178
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:06,890
the fuel as the cases you can you can

179
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:13,069
see that this is this is class demos

180
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:26,580
when I fast my faster windows either

181
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:28,560
generate mmm some crashes okay

182
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,580
in the following section I will

183
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:40,859
introduce the next generation fast

184
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:46,680
system and the new system it is is is

185
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:52,530
made of tribute PJs and the I fell the

186
00:15:46,680 --> 00:16:02,089
Kumu and under with my traditional fast

187
00:15:52,530 --> 00:16:14,990
and some method with as to II has to e4

188
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:14,990
symbolic education okay

189
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:22,679
okay here if I fell colonel fat from

190
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:29,339
work mmm

191
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:34,949
at first we need entire CPU we need a

192
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:43,149
cpu supported Petraeus feature and and

193
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:48,040
we need a software to to decode to the

194
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:52,480
code the cpiotto stream and habit habit

195
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:59,649
so fast to have a go fast to offend more

196
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:06,279
more branches branches at first the CPU

197
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:11,230
will generate generate the rotator the

198
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:14,439
laser and views that is obvious add to

199
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:19,110
the software decoder and the that

200
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:27,130
decoder will decode the scipios CPU

201
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:32,199
simulator and when decoding finished and

202
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:37,330
the software to injure PGs of the

203
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:50,590
decoder will tell us we get how many how

204
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:56,918
many branches we get and here it all

205
00:17:50,590 --> 00:18:01,689
here the program the what African of us

206
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:09,730
from work at first if the inner CPU and

207
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:18,250
the master level is KVM Petrie's we need

208
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:20,950
qvm the second one it will a Kumu petrus

209
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,220
we need a Kumu and we change

210
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,480
ginger Kumu and that the next one is a

211
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,910
photo we need a

212
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:35,300
further to offend in the blog branches

213
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:39,560
provided theater folder FL and to create

214
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:43,970
the pinna map and the last one a turkey

215
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:46,659
affair the eight I fell will record the

216
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:52,850
symbol according to the bank when

217
00:18:46,660 --> 00:19:02,510
veneration simple hmm is the affair

218
00:18:52,850 --> 00:19:08,540
Colonel fat framework is the world kinda

219
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:15,080
fast has the result and the friend fell

220
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:20,870
when the baton days and I know we need

221
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:26,870
it we need a memory for 4G 4G B and we

222
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:32,479
need a CPU support support Petrie's here

223
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:38,050
is the demo you can you can see that the

224
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,050
left is the Cano if here the red is

225
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:50,050
traditional windows and this Colonel

226
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:50,050
fast we combined from Wickham mentum

227
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:04,570
here is the twenties and this one is of

228
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:08,810
the affair Canova's and other Montes is

229
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:14,659
we can cover more code and automatic

230
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:19,790
veneration and the caviar is not a

231
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:23,930
platform support we can fast líneas

232
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:25,010
Connor Mac OS Mac OS will support in the

233
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:30,800
future

234
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:36,490
the ps-aguié others the solar advantage

235
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,490
is Scipio Subaru conveyor is

236
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:49,170
is where we finished the or discard this

237
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:54,250
this advantage is encounter a single

238
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:58,600
Erica integral number is Pro to innovate

239
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:01,410
loop without seeing low though fast

240
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:09,990
infinitely and the low pass coverage

241
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:09,990
then and me so so so a symbol

242
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:19,360
this is a big big biggest program the

243
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:22,710
actual actual fuzzy we meet program or

244
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:31,120
when you meet the cold test lab cheese

245
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:40,330
if if if you want to reach the target on

246
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:44,979
the beta code how how to how to to you

247
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:50,919
can to 8mm not done manually not many

248
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:56,410
auto auto reach Auto rate the man

249
00:21:50,920 --> 00:22:10,180
ability code this is the biggest biggest

250
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:13,750
program so so the biggest program in

251
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:18,160
actual fighting is when a fair process

252
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:28,860
code branch branches the input the input

253
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:35,550
is randomly random muted if you if if a

254
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,550
test as input if you random lose one

255
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:43,030
finger you will not reach the target

256
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:47,050
target the wanted one ability code if

257
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:51,940
you'll never reach it the last

258
00:22:47,050 --> 00:23:02,169
spent many many times to reach that

259
00:22:51,940 --> 00:23:10,000
whenever you could you can't waited so

260
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:13,390
how to make up fer so Cummings we look

261
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,600
looking for the related career tech nerd

262
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:22,660
technology is important we fended

263
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:28,149
existing Timbo is crucial to knee

264
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:34,810
tagging images with research the anger

265
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:37,430
the as to eat and being FF and finally

266
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:40,529
we we choose the as chewy

267
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,529
[Music]

268
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:51,970
here is the how to solve the special

269
00:23:46,420 --> 00:24:01,210
paths with the symbolic is a ocean if we

270
00:23:51,970 --> 00:24:06,780
meet the particular particular code the

271
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:09,720
that fuyi will mmm will calculate the

272
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:15,580
pest conditions for us

273
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:19,440
mmm that's like the pewter the as soon

274
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:22,590
as we will calculate a well you

275
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,700
calculate the value help us to reach

276
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:30,610
have us to reach the syrup has the past

277
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:34,720
one you can to alpha is one to bid is

278
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:42,129
one has to love one build beta is six

279
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:52,810
and you can reach with any path in your

280
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:55,380
program so how to improve the food bank

281
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,379
fast

282
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:04,570
in my research I come by two

283
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:09,450
technologies we at I come by the affair

284
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:21,939
and the s3 and we can we can get more

285
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:23,770
more complete pass coverage and and how

286
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:33,820
to connect how to connect a load

287
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:39,090
actually and the affair and to import

288
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:45,250
the importer to FL it's a string and the

289
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:48,730
important to a3 if also a string so we

290
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:53,470
can use the same string at seed as a

291
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:59,040
symptom if we can can offend them my

292
00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:03,100
paths with kfl and we can't read as we

293
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:12,430
it will actually type of work we can try

294
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:19,480
to fail to have a Havas here is the

295
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:23,260
combat without we can fend for us most

296
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,710
girl code it Italy to send all the

297
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,620
coverage to pass and Falcon complaints

298
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:32,880
of operating system as to you have also

299
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,879
have many problems

300
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:47,740
in the next part of yourself cell so

301
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:53,519
abuse et fils so hope you see this is a

302
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:58,779
POC 2019 and six to ten days three hmm

303
00:26:53,519 --> 00:27:00,970
you can see the music a physical here's

304
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:05,980
a piece of code up you see we can see

305
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:11,320
that at the false but we we need to

306
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:15,730
create create to cursor and wait we need

307
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:22,720
a Krypton with different assets and the

308
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:26,619
coast one will be sad Ling axle three

309
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,019
hundred and and adding X to the eighth

310
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:33,418
and at the second whitening acts to

311
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:37,929
three hundred under the next to detail

312
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:43,600
then we will then we will call culture

313
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:47,169
and the also said cosa connect and and

314
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,230
the dysfunction we will copy copies or

315
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:54,190
cursors tools configured to have a

316
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:58,419
cursor of Thoth and at the last when

317
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:04,919
they when we update the cursor to

318
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:07,960
miracle miracle happened here has

319
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:13,119
details about you'll see what will

320
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:16,559
happen the window pills is one when the

321
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:20,740
pews is one this is the system will hmm

322
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:27,519
we were changes the cursors object some

323
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:30,600
value the value is for for our sides for

324
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,600
memory size

325
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:42,960
but other by the system will do not a

326
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,830
plan for in enough enough enough memory

327
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:51,210
fall for the new cursor the cinema to

328
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:57,590
change the cursor says but the season

329
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:57,590
didn't the a plan for enough memory

330
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:15,930
health details you can see the bug is it

331
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:22,050
is here it will edit the bottom of the

332
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:26,640
rect and added the old one with new new

333
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:34,350
bag new right bottom and here here we

334
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:43,950
can see we can see 13 0 to 5 AE you can

335
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:49,649
see that terrifies FF is added added by

336
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:57,210
Ling X - 2 T a and the next two leading

337
00:29:49,650 --> 00:30:05,280
to the to put either the from here you

338
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:09,210
can see it added the cursus Y you can

339
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:12,990
added the cursors - to point Y and

340
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:19,920
cursors file point why either add edit

341
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:22,280
or so you can see either soul in the

342
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,280
memory

343
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:34,179
and when we run when nest nest nest

344
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,810
function what will what will happen they

345
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:46,360
will call the in G copy pants and it

346
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:52,270
will call this dysfunction and and as

347
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:55,179
last what will happen when we run the

348
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:59,730
whole hope you see and you can see the

349
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:08,380
system cost you can see that a memory

350
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:11,500
crapped here here the details

351
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:18,460
if there was the copy the memory copy

352
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:28,900
diffuse you can see target target assess

353
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:33,060
if a 5k and what do we will happen when

354
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:36,790
the cursor cursor update actually

355
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:42,419
actually we already get a heap overflow

356
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:42,420
we already we already gathered overflow

357
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:56,080
here is where details details about what

358
00:31:54,310 --> 00:32:05,050
will be happened when when the cursor

359
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:10,899
update and we get her memory or flow so

360
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:14,490
nest hub nest or a pod is as it was

361
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:19,950
something some details about at a spot

362
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:28,410
as as weak as you know we can we we get

363
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:32,320
integral flow if you just want to across

364
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,140
you can you can finish your work if you

365
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,280
get a

366
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:42,820
spot and many works you need to do you

367
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:47,470
need to many many works just like this

368
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:54,070
the the exporter processed at Alexis you

369
00:32:47,470 --> 00:33:00,790
can put put the restaurant and selectees

370
00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:05,230
you can test like the berry the picture

371
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:10,540
has select systems memory you can your

372
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:13,320
show put out all the objects regularly

373
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:18,250
and put them together

374
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:26,879
mm-hm and make it a stable people who

375
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:32,860
need a negative label and how to make

376
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:40,030
every read and read and as we we get

377
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:45,129
integral flow we need read read we need

378
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:52,090
a convert convert integral flow to used

379
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:56,440
are free so we choose to we choose which

380
00:33:52,090 --> 00:34:03,129
was the menu object and we put it a menu

381
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:07,330
object the hand behind in the be handle

382
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:11,590
of the cursor object when all flow

383
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:15,159
happened the view read read manuals

384
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:19,210
clogged clouds manual manuals clock it

385
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:26,679
will set the cross Crocker from one to

386
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:30,580
do when when the clock is set to one the

387
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:34,870
manual is clock is locked love you can

388
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:37,869
free you can a free locked menu and when

389
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:42,668
we will set the

390
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:46,299
- Pete if the receptive to the falaqa is

391
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:49,828
unlocked you and and now you can free

392
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:55,659
free or menu or you can you so you can

393
00:34:49,829 --> 00:35:00,190
so you you can King you use a free park

394
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:05,519
so you can spree three that either at

395
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:09,099
the hip and King or read and the red

396
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:19,589
have a perfect in your read every read

397
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:25,269
and read here it was is pro time when we

398
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:31,259
we put we did a lot of work and finally

399
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:31,258
we is port is port of the windows Connor

400
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:36,749
health here it's worth demo you can see

401
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:14,790
as you can see we explore the from a

402
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:19,980
normal user and its escape to the system

403
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:26,009
we is for the system we can add any user

404
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,010
we want we can add an other user

405
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:43,329
so the next part is the fad in Chinese

406
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:55,039
internists part I will I will serve the

407
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:59,200
church aliens have faced the Durand

408
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:04,910
- no fuss on the oven under Windows 10

409
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:12,740
17 June night to Microsoft in introduced

410
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:18,009
tap a solution mechanism to prevent the

411
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:21,919
used are free used to ferry focus in my

412
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:26,660
experience you have free park of the

413
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:37,160
Tdap object is almost over almost over

414
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:40,250
out of the tap isolation and this is

415
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:46,670
something about the GTI tag kept

416
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:51,319
isolation we I will show the normal to

417
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:56,809
the object a chain and the object the

418
00:37:51,319 --> 00:38:03,980
memory layout change and how it makes

419
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:12,740
fast more harder and you can see the

420
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:17,450
booster here today object attaching at

421
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:21,229
the normal way of using a user free to

422
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:24,288
is plot if we've called you you we have

423
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:28,460
as you we can spray the object to the

424
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:32,720
heap and get a blurry every raspberry

425
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:37,130
threat and as you can see now we can't

426
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:40,730
now we can't get actually read event

427
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:43,450
because because because the tap

428
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,450
isolation

429
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:51,770
here is the how the capacitance works

430
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:57,280
before we before the table addition we

431
00:38:51,770 --> 00:39:03,700
can spree spree Auto to free the teaser

432
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:08,060
in the pool mmm we can we can conclude

433
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:10,669
objects of Tears header and head we can

434
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:18,410
control the objects header part and that

435
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:21,190
is our part if you get Utah free you can

436
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:25,220
spree in the heap you can control

437
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:32,080
control the service header and under

438
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:35,540
service theater here here the hill the

439
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:40,190
after tablet estrogen-receptor to

440
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:46,460
service the service object will divide

441
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:49,970
into two paths the header view will

442
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,580
allow a lock in Colonel a solution

443
00:39:49,970 --> 00:40:03,819
decision map view and the teaser will

444
00:39:52,580 --> 00:40:09,380
lock to hip very free when we create

445
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:14,660
service are free free surface you can

446
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:24,980
see that the operation is worked as ad

447
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:27,200
as the sense of view here here the heads

448
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:32,180
of details about the surface rider creed

449
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:35,210
and the free we can do we can is free to

450
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:38,149
act as a station heap as you can see if

451
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:41,110
your 3 the service cool and at every

452
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:45,700
left or three slot on the wheel one and

453
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:50,330
two free slot slot will be filled very

454
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:54,129
master service masters of his object so

455
00:40:50,330 --> 00:41:01,880
we can't we can control

456
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:05,510
Supriya Supriya teaser so we can't so

457
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:13,310
that the UAF can't be is part about this

458
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:22,660
way here are the details about about the

459
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:28,759
isolation at firstly yeah you can send

460
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:31,299
mmm base G pointed have a solution it's

461
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,860
a pointer and you will friend those

462
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:37,490
habitations what and you will find that

463
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:40,850
the tab link and under public you will

464
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:46,120
offense the view contains OGD object

465
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:46,120
headers who can offend the headers and

466
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:56,890
that and that is this beautiful sauce to

467
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,890
substitute theaters a log and the free

468
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:06,799
that the service data is locked on the

469
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:11,390
session pool and we only we only can

470
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,970
spray spray the spray to the bigger part

471
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:17,080
we can control the dinner part but but

472
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:21,109
the header the header is lockable are

473
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:30,470
allowed on the map view you can to

474
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:34,040
header the header the header is locked

475
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:37,580
on the wheel we kind of spray two to two

476
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:41,150
days this this wheel so we kind of

477
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:45,400
control object with cancer can choose

478
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:51,980
the objects lens we need to control our

479
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:56,630
blend objects lens all set something you

480
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:03,390
can get a system little system every

481
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:10,299
read all right and sorry

482
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:15,160
here is the fuels about surface tablet a

483
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:19,949
position you can see that in the service

484
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:23,078
header that either

485
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:25,509
mmm the theater and the head header is

486
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:28,809
no longer together there there is a

487
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:33,459
pointer on those header and you can send

488
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:38,890
the fender the European pointer but mmm

489
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:42,519
but they they never together here the

490
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:46,328
TDI objective to today I'll present for

491
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,538
pass it also a plan with the HEPA

492
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:52,479
oxidation either as we can see the

493
00:43:49,539 --> 00:44:02,199
object is created through the bed a

494
00:43:52,479 --> 00:44:06,939
suitable as suitable solution here here

495
