1
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,170
hello everyone we're security

2
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,670
researchers functions micro and then is

3
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,340
it really my honor to have a

4
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,230
presentation here in Amsterdam this is

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,470
my first travel I'm done

6
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,360
and today our topic is about the artists

7
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:08,009
buzzing a quick but a quick buck hunting

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:12,390
method first I will only introduce my

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,780
team member and didn't me Mooney I have

10
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,780
about nine years of security appearance

11
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,290
focus on sir one billet hunt and

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,770
legalizing many answer iOS and mobile

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:31,710
and also Mike and the windows and the

14
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:37,220
details member hello everyone my name is

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:41,070
Lila and I'm how four years of security

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,899
appearance and is a member or mobile

17
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,289
advanced threats research all Trend

18
00:01:42,899 --> 00:02:01,049
Micro and now focus on Mac OS and iOS

19
00:01:46,290 --> 00:02:05,670
owner pity discovery and mohanty my name

20
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:09,060
is Jung and I'm an engineer during from

21
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,810
chin micro and has one u.s. security

22
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,489
experience I focus on mobile security

23
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,110
research at an Android color

24
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:23,010
vulnerability and enjoy reverse

25
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,370
engineering hello everyone

26
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,019
I'm Todd and in this section I or shoes

27
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,620
or your father

28
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:38,010
 foreign strategies our

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:40,650
implementation okay first I will go

30
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,390
through the pin point about phantom

31
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,950
matters and the color railing for the

32
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,589
security researchers as we all know

33
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,880
Sookie thinking of AFL which is the most

34
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,109
popular

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,390
feedback based fuzzing inside and it and

36
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,000
the

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,869
Vern's to mutating inputs choruses

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,200
according to some less in taxes and the

39
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,300
record as a code courage a society it

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,420
could keep a good input conversation

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,090
with could bring more code carriages to

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,869
further mutation and another kind of

43
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,850
words is for the system call fuzzing

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,670
which we call it as with the color

45
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,519
Edward Collins most like a of a FL

46
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,750
version to us system call buzzer which

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,420
is based on the QEMU IAM with basic

48
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,310
blogger could carry the feedback

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,600
researchers through the pass system

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,739
calls format as the prototype and

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:44,769
configures the first agent before runs a

52
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,709
fasting cycle what it good is said as

53
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,140
with color could reproduce the crash to

54
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:53,650
generate as a pure C code by

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,369
corresponding a log and as automatically

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,130
as possible so from the brief comparison

57
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,100
of the typical bug hunt methods in the

58
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:07,120
table we could see side take the Google

59
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:11,380
cluster of us products which is Poisson

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,230
so FL or lib fast for example the code

61
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,260
card is feedback if this piece of

62
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,579
fasting is suitable for deployed at

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,279
large skill

64
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,460
hiren you will usually touches a code

65
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,679
courage than sailing mostly because the

66
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,789
deep code and location could not be

67
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,410
easily touched but because of data

68
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:36,940
dependency and code exaction sequence

69
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,919
dependency and also the sea could not

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,979
have to find a new attack surfaces

71
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,710
because our fighting interface is

72
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,890
configured by the expert knowledge which

73
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,190
is our norm on that handle the

74
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,640
quadrivalent for example as the google

75
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,740
product product team deal is your a good

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,200
way to find a new attack services and

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,690
the good one abilities hidden in the

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,780
deep location especially for logic even

79
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,229
abilities however it is really time

80
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,219
consuming and result is unaffected as we

81
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,979
know

82
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,660
just like as a traditional Chinese bagua

83
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,020
sighs Yahoo Xiang which means the two

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,350
teeth two extremely opposite sides could

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,430
always contains each other maybe we

86
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,620
could merge the two different kinds of

87
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:36,820
fat misers and cuddling together

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:40,750
so how let's think about the hourglass

89
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,469
by the bath so Abbas the upper part and

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:50,820
the lower part are connected in a stream

91
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:55,480
a single channel as the boat attack we

92
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:58,480
you you midpoint our sand flow firms is

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,850
dripped into the lower part if we

94
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,760
control the biotech by size and the

95
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,100
buying filter we could control all the

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,159
flow from the other side tongue sided

97
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,720
Celera and the first term so can you

98
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,080
find this high similarity between

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,300
hourglass an operating system take the

100
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,359
Android corner fighting for example the

101
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,390
other side means the other side that

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,480
means user mode data deliver a codex

103
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,870
section and the raw part means the

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,450
kernel part and as the pot attack means

105
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,270
also mode switches channel such as a

106
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,810
system call memory map binder and so

107
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,539
forth

108
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,270
take the user fat for example as the

109
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,669
left column shows the our site could

110
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,430
mean an e in walking with lower

111
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:48,700
probabilities application and the so

112
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,340
downside could mean means soon or

113
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,460
process with her privileges support

114
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,669
attack would means our external API

115
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:01,210
interfaces or mechanisms such as a

116
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:05,979
binder socket I was a PC communication

117
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,289
as you can imagine so why not intercept

118
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,590
and attainted the normal use of flow at

119
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,320
the body tag of our glass so advantage

120
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,049
over our glass the obviously the fast

121
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,229
activity could attach deep code location

122
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,599
because the normal user activities with

123
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,490
a little fast for the bypass

124
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,860
i nee well addition most elevate

125
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,619
validations check in kernel mode Pratt

126
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,229
with high probability probability and

127
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:34,899
the way we will tint and the method was

128
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:40,479
a increase in kernel part which crashed

129
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:42,849
the whole kernel which maybe indicate a

130
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,270
new or unknown attack services in this

131
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:49,240
way impractical for example we could

132
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,109
usually cause for example so Android

133
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,419
graphic tremor

134
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:58,809
khadiyah saw crisis him about one minute

135
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:01,599
which the first Phantom is laterally

136
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,279
introduced reduced comparing the

137
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,770
traditional fighting method and coded

138
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,930
revealing so the main workflow of our

139
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,878
hourglass passing could be like this

140
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,399
tomorrow you will map surprise the

141
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,740
sources as normal as possible for

142
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,499
example when you're loading and playing

143
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,089
the big are lying 3d online games such

144
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:27,939
as data polly blitzer them and

145
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:31,479
connecting Wi-Fi Bluetooth like dresses

146
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:33,009
and so so far so far dragged aside some

147
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,098
are theater and the construction traffic

148
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:41,560
will go through the bottle jack and the

149
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,410
small and the deeper the fast will cook

150
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,619
a real courage so you could feed so

151
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,509
create info and called courage

152
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,350
information back to the fatty sauce

153
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:55,839
agent so that more new salt fighting

154
00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:01,149
sauces could be multiplied it is our

155
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:05,050
philosophy of or hourglass fuzzy and a

156
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:07,060
no way we introduce our practice in

157
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,579
opposed to the yuta mode use mode

158
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,489
fighting and acronyms fighting and first

159
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:25,599
we will introduce our users base fuzzy

160
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:27,730
at odd and like many photos in the

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,760
newspapers in patch we will talk about

162
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,519
purpose including the search I was

163
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,310
selecting other interfaces and enable

164
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,650
doesn't iris watch and and

165
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,189
the philosopher in strategy under some

166
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,819
practice in our implementing and first

167
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,790
is how firstly how way selected the

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,710
other interfaces Avenue and George

169
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,079
there are many system abs and your

170
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,089
installed apps and not like as your

171
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,640
installed apps system apps jewelry

172
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,880
corresponding to a system services which

173
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:03,550
can touch more data and let the Yura

174
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,380
install apps punch so firstly this

175
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,290
services across from the herbs are our

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,050
condemns then what are we concern you

177
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,750
that whether whether whether these apps

178
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,029
ever exposed vulnerable hit before which

179
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,940
will help us to determine where to focus

180
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:23,020
on and fast and also it should have a

181
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,150
relatively step of a much for it will

182
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,760
make it a little easily to trigger deep

183
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:33,459
in the corpus and in fact and finally

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,930
after the up the investigation of the

185
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,450
code we finally found that there are

186
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:43,300
system apps like the Bluetooth another

187
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:46,089
AFC next what do we want okay here and

188
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,069
we all know that Bruce ever have some

189
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:53,290
famous moon abilities like blue bronze

190
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:56,950
and elder and also Eddie hey okay

191
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,439
also as a picker shoes the Pluto's also

192
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,690
a postman in data processed course core

193
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,100
banks which will directly process or

194
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,470
draw Pluto's package and here so here we

195
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,390
are your Bluetooth like this here we

196
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:18,190
will bluetooth as an example to show you

197
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:21,010
how we how do we do it so now let's go

198
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,680
now let's have an inkling without Brutus

199
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,250
let me know in under nine the system

200
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,219
package

201
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,890
Brutus nuke still text the response to

202
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,830
maximize Brutus will work well for users

203
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:36,459
and I will change the later is that is

204
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:39,910
that you that it's a is a sofa or little

205
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:41,979
stop dot s o play play as the memo do to

206
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,240
handle and process bluetooth packets

207
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,339
that are passed into and send out so at

208
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,080
least ago shows their man in pioneering

209
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,800
relates the two Bluetooth you

210
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,330
replace the the Pluto's they put the

211
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,410
proton so we'll connect the nine

212
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,770
implementations of Pluto's tag machine

213
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,829
including the HDI air to cap and other

214
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,370
high layers which is unload chopped

215
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:13,870
power L 2 cap and this so file the chain

216
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,470
ISO file change the file easier to use

217
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,120
by the system's Brutus app which also

218
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,180
service to control the polluted stock

219
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,640
like the never closed and and other

220
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,979
configurations on a Bluetooth stack and

221
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,689
a bits of file they pump and as a bundle

222
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,970
so file is just used for you even do the

223
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:37,450
photo log of local applications which

224
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,090
you want to use bluetooth and here and

225
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:43,000
and and in here we will focus on the

226
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,610
label pluto star s or amongst the man

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,250
implementing here out of the smoke

228
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,710
machine

229
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,290
so this is the substrate of the Polaroid

230
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,420
you can say that so many photos here are

231
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,410
waiting for us to investigate but in

232
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,540
fact some are some of them are necessary

233
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,430
for us and after analyze the

234
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,380
vulnerabilities the Pluto's error it was

235
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,810
posted before and some time ago

236
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,230
debugging investigation we finally chose

237
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,630
to to Fox owns the photo stuck the youth

238
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:16,780
driver and the embedded and embedded

239
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,910
driver first either stock powder the

240
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,449
stock photo contains the implementations

241
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,699
of each profile the profile tell machine

242
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,550
another callbacks and and the youth

243
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,910
driver further contains you update the

244
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,849
latest coach and the finally the

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,280
embedded driver further in close

246
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,860
embedded the encoder and a decoder which

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:44,800
will be used when streaming media data

248
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:46,900
and here and Aniyah see Aniyah see here

249
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,569
is contained in the stock in a stock

250
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,730
photo and so you can see that each

251
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,820
quarter difference to our feature all

252
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,350
our profile or Austell machine and how

253
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,990
they stand watching our are in each

254
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,340
adage and in working and in work and in

255
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,340
worked will be discussed later

256
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,670
so now left now let's have a view of the

257
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,420
architecture our products aren't Android

258
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,630
and so they put little stack as we know

259
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,219
either will not only communicate with

260
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,709
remote devices it also provides

261
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,800
interfaces for local applications so the

262
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:24,529
left path so they left patch reprints

263
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,469
represents the various remote devices

264
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:30,649
here we have a simple caustic concept

265
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,750
example for the SDP but for LTP

266
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,320
protocols the service discovery protocol

267
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,270
you can say that after the data come in

268
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,440
the packet is finally passed to the FTP

269
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:45,470
relevant message here and an an inner

270
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,750
right patch which shows the internal of

271
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,730
the local structure our Bluetooth our

272
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,890
blood Roy's which which is the

273
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,040
implementation of Pluto's language and

274
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:57,410
from up to and from up to down we

275
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,930
separate it into a different paths first

276
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:08,060
is the application layer and another is

277
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:10,189
the Bluetooth stack so now foster that

278
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,930
lets to see the application layer all

279
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,709
the applications there will use

280
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,359
bluetooth on this layer and they are

281
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,699
there the client or server which will

282
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,740
process the data preserved in out by

283
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,230
produce and surely they will get the

284
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,110
Bluetooth service by the pipe under but

285
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,170
sometimes the UI PC will be used here

286
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,880
you can say that as a 2 TP will you will

287
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,449
use a familiar the you are PC when

288
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,790
processing data like here and under this

289
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,130
health will be discussed later and also

290
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,860
at other Hardware there will be some

291
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,020
drivers in kinome to ensure that the

292
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,000
video tab sure work well and also this

293
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,240
possibly out of the functions in this

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,910
drivers will will be will be our target

295
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:58,040
in our chrono pass part yeah

296
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,350
now let's go through the start flow

297
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,589
startup flow to get to know how to start

298
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:07,160
machines will mention before I finish

299
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,079
adage also ways also bike really

300
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,270
understanding the startup flow it will

301
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,279
help us to find to find a white to

302
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,220
trigger to trigger these callbacks to

303
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,040
trigger these car beds

304
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,020
led to each star machines so now let's

305
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,959
begin and now this figure shows up

306
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:26,560
around when the Protoss is in a bodge

307
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,020
here we simply separate this separates

308
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,520
into two parts first is a linear flow

309
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,800
and then is the type of flow and I know

310
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,410
also although polluters are amorous

311
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,959
Rhett he was modest r2 in it the motors

312
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,030
interview us but what what will be what

313
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,190
will first to be invoked is the inner

314
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:52,030
flow that in the left part of the figure

315
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:53,920
is here but here will be a figure in the

316
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,339
you know flow our start in the fluid

317
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,219
starting brutal service and and in it

318
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,680
I've been in some Oreos like like like

319
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,890
the start like the stark optical module

320
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,470
and others finally it will it will set

321
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,860
up important the callback functions to

322
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:14,890
process messages is this is the PTU

323
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,929
HCI messenger process it will process

324
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,959
messages that are passed to the that a

325
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,060
pastor from the HCI to low layer or an

326
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,640
unruly and a routine this message to

327
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,159
Eric a player if it is necessary but in

328
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,130
this time in in follow just steady just

329
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,410
studied up under the under then is the

330
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,920
enable followed to let it already begin

331
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,960
to work so now let's now let's see the

332
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,000
in ever follow and an unlike any the

333
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,370
flow and I'm following finishing many

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,890
initiation for edges turn emotions of

335
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,620
each profiles it has a beginning

336
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,980
outreach there will be there will be a

337
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:54,820
branch there will be a branch to check

338
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:58,450
to check to check here to check we're in

339
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,600
either flow is done if it's if it's not

340
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,420
if it's not it is not it will try to

341
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,000
invoke functions at the event in its

342
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,200
stack to finish you what you need flow

343
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,880
should do and if the inner flow is done

344
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,850
and then it's time to set up all the

345
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,070
stat emotions and Anna and also there

346
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,929
are callbacks another interval and other

347
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,700
interfaces that will be used for each

348
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,679
layers and each profiles and each

349
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,679
protocol and under this figure

350
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:36,580
yeah and another speaker issues and this

351
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:40,899
figure shows the caustic I was even in

352
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,699
it stack here here's the here the figure

353
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,640
also give us the information that is a

354
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:48,070
the Pluto's app will use a new sweat

355
00:18:45,640 --> 00:19:01,960
yeah you can see we will use a new

356
00:18:48,070 --> 00:19:04,720
thread to start - sorry yeah toast open

357
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,650
to fit he not in it and so after so

358
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,950
editor after top the Pte men men put

359
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,320
entering it either will finish the setup

360
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,960
you know finish instead about a cop axe

361
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,639
finally and an acceptor and except for

362
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,260
this models when was almost the most

363
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,180
important thing is to let the message

364
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,129
loop strata peak in Tehran which is

365
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,400
already said having in it for low

366
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,280
elevate his cast is this this is a mess

367
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,610
- you love stretch to finish to finish

368
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,350
this is the PTO is the PTO message if

369
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:43,240
look around where we will be involved

370
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:45,219
and finally and finally it'll be tells a

371
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,230
layer at the protists are ready to serve

372
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,860
while buying from me in watching I

373
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:53,080
strange and also with step rate as a

374
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,090
communication with Bluetooth process

375
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,120
into two groups when the remote

376
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,250
communication like sending and receiving

377
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,429
packets from other Bluetooth devices and

378
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,740
another is local communication like to

379
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,870
your bluetooth service the service

380
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,240
object wire ponder all or just of

381
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,679
clementa Machado stream ETL tool Stan

382
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,680
emotion why are you acting

383
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,070
so and now let's go so the common packet

384
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,200
structure over Pluto sound and George as

385
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,659
a photographer for have a uniform data

386
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,360
format is somehow is somehow funny

387
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,230
friendly for weekend controller that are

388
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,540
more easily in an George era package

389
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:38,040
they received from the remote will be

390
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:40,678
described by a fact the PTSD are just

391
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,928
like the big shoes but but in fact or a

392
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,380
data should we process surely I in the

393
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:48,630
data arrived field and and also and also

394
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:55,799
and also in the code we will see that

395
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:59,340
sometimes and also in the colloquial

396
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:02,010
system some sometimes sometimes occur

397
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,409
over us days to calculate the real

398
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:12,960
address of the data not not just by the

399
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:15,270
data data array field and and also and

400
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,370
also the offset the out the offset field

401
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,559
sometimes will gather the processing

402
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:22,678
function to skip some head when either

403
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:26,899
begin to process data and I'll remember

404
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,900
that we have example in the next section

405
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,780
yeah and also when Pluto's receives a

406
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,210
package from the outside the message log

407
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,450
process function just the way we talked

408
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,790
before this this view this will then

409
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,070
mean will examine the package and decide

410
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,200
where to pass it to xarelto cab level

411
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:51,120
and if the answer is yes the LT cable

412
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,370
receive a theater like this will be will

413
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,979
be what will be invoked as the ECL Delta

414
00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:05,580
will be passed to it for further process

415
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:08,400
and as the above issues so now now have

416
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,830
a knowledge have example reach first

417
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:14,190
base scenario when other Brutus attempt

418
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,379
want to repair with us the SMT the

419
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,750
so-called the security manager protocol

420
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,169
will will will be invoked and to receive

421
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:25,140
an assent for security pairing as you

422
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:27,870
can see from the figure with SNP packet

423
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:31,679
you received the pact is passed to

424
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:35,129
they out to Aceveda and pyro fictional

425
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,320
and under then after many process the

426
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,100
callbacks function the cop explosion

427
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,010
here here will be invoked to do is this

428
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:50,730
SNP packets let's take a shoe this list

429
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:53,460
and you know and also this vigorous show

430
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,360
you show you the cost of the process our

431
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:00,840
processing SMP package and a to to will

432
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,120
to bluetooth low energy devices so it's

433
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:07,860
the SMTP our data let the function in

434
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,539
process the package and also this

435
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,729
speaker these people will give you up

436
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,980
will impose out the SMP package this is

437
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,460
very important so as you can see that

438
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,640
the first part the first byte represent

439
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,130
to represent the type house I was a SNP

440
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,549
packaging so by changing its value we

441
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:31,950
may favor different behaviors out of the

442
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:34,529
SMP related functions and this is Lisa

443
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,100
another stage scenario for SDP this

444
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:39,630
service discovery protocol communication

445
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,850
this thing will give us or for you all

446
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:47,010
have a packet eroded when is the

447
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:49,500
received first yeah for firstly firstly

448
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,289
the messaging process loop and then the

449
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,679
callbacks will another callback so we're

450
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:58,440
past the tools were to here to show Alto

451
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,799
cap and under in the auto cap just like

452
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,470
just like here in value is cute

453
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,389
functions that mean maybe because that

454
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,510
means the channels of our STP and

455
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:12,899
finally we've opened then is the open

456
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,580
phone he worked and and also in the Oval

457
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:17,309
function there there will be our

458
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,668
contacts to switch to justice which is a

459
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:22,980
pro to threat to the Tudors first letter

460
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:27,830
that will that will process the STV data

461
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,830
to the three callbacks the SD batata int

462
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:39,629
and and also this this is the cost this

463
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:43,309
is the caustic fall for the upper fault

464
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,309
for processing the SDP dead

465
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,740
and this thinker on as a speaker all

466
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,800
social structure map of the STP package

467
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,820
as I can say in effect we should make

468
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:58,860
sure you that you either show us that is

469
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,870
the attribute requesting package and as

470
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,199
a perm and allowed her Milan's

471
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,659
is the is the 0 X 1 T and which way she

472
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,150
is 29 in technical and the size our

473
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:15,510
following data behind is just universe

474
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:17,610
are 29 okay about way we discussed some

475
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,170
some scenarios about how broad Roy the

476
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,080
process packet either received from

477
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:24,270
outside and here we discuss or common

478
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,090
scenario which we all let us have a look

479
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,680
into the local communication and the

480
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,659
early we talked about the yeren

481
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,400
bluetooth service we all know that we

482
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,280
can use bandar to canada service and

483
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,850
elite but sometimes the you IPC will be

484
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,220
used for example the a2dp the a2dp we

485
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,560
are using a pc to receive data for

486
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,320
completing training audios to other

487
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,240
produced devices like health says here

488
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,010
we discussed the scenario pas de play

489
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,430
music

490
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:58,250
this figure give us the overview of how

491
00:25:53,430 --> 00:26:00,900
it works here we can see Vince Winston

492
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,260
blessed annotate of France France to

493
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:11,420
help phone they asked me the SPCA is 10

494
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:11,420
frames will invoke the HTTP PC encoder

495
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:17,190
encoder post on Xena Tet then the data

496
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,139
will be read from the RPC and energy

497
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,540
level to SV the encoder finally was

498
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,390
finally what you seen what is in either

499
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,100
encoded data he over surprised us is

500
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,230
that there is an embedded

501
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,070
encoder encoder and decoder in the

502
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:34,740
protoid the SBC is the encoder in fact

503
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,540
is the SPC an async code of a finally

504
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,560
you'll use the UI PC to read data from

505
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,870
the local music player now and and here

506
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,060
is the kostet or how SVC read the

507
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:49,169
encoder only walk even worked you can

508
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,780
say is the a2dp SPC cinder frames final

509
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,880
image and another thing the cost and

510
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,790
also this is a cost doc

511
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,830
I was a yuppie Cerrito compared with the

512
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,810
figure about the SVC encoder you know

513
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,629
fan of that either will be it will DBS

514
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:06,149
be the rid of feeding your your the UI

515
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:15,320
PC rate your they you are

516
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:15,320
oh no sorry sorry oh sorry yeah

517
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:24,150
[Music]

518
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,640
you can either maybe uh yeah I feel Dana

519
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,260
from local milk player Allison the SBC

520
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,940
encoder will process the data and

521
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,830
finally the data will be sent to a

522
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,840
remote device so so now we know the

523
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,520
workflow our Eastern a machine the

524
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,760
common package structure under for mas

525
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,980
that each that is profiles used with and

526
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,920
then we'll try to release copies of each

527
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:50,970
of each profiles as other as other

528
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,830
faculty to fast and now with that racket

529
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,690
function or select each and what we

530
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,000
should do is to enable or sanitizer to

531
00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:00,060
help us to do vulnerabilities easily and

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,290
eternally we just the in ableism and

533
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:08,220
brought to us by the up our command like

534
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:10,440
like here and in fact they are too wise

535
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,390
to entry number is a memorial and wines

536
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,280
that directly status as anti the target

537
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,830
to be to be addressed and another is to

538
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,110
sterilize the arrived upon in Android

539
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:22,590
RPP file here we use the first one and

540
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:26,040
also sank and also for skipping the copy

541
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,500
on infants with rocket le copy the copy

542
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,899
isn't the copy the s and the pin file to

543
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,080
to make a new system image directly

544
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,680
innovation without any container you can

545
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,070
still like this yeah so here you can see

546
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:45,690
in the inherently linear tostadas

547
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:47,280
already house is an airport and now we

548
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,650
are now with the

549
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,530
interface tools just another central

550
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,360
support in a bot let's have a look at is

551
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,430
a structure a your space file in

552
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,100
framework and this is the oval average

553
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,930
and in the laptop is a tractor we want

554
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,969
to first base and Holly in a but also

555
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,150
our fault editor will include it

556
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,030
included in this part also also LV side

557
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,670
to the

558
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,470
- I talked communicator ways when the

559
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,930
local communication and the other is to

560
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,510
is the remote communication they also

561
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,400
should be a paler process which is used

562
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,390
to perform local communicate with

563
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,680
Bluetooth and a writer is a controller

564
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:26,230
which contains our monitor and are

565
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,210
analyzing agent and a fan engine

566
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,280
controller the father agent except as a

567
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,440
controller signal - lot to lot our

568
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,510
materials into a target and a performing

569
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,160
debtor with her team and unlike

570
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,980
contagion functions best dundies

571
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,170
material and also the also is the auto

572
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,300
live signal will tell father interval to

573
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,160
to some value of body actions like

574
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,480
repeating in working at a one fighting

575
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:52,090
point and as a means of research firstly

576
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,980
the file I teach which was in fact wave

577
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,470
on our items to be easy to come to an

578
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,690
extent as we mentioned before since our

579
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,120
target everyone file early need well

580
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:03,730
formatted data to pass in and to pass an

581
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,520
early in some context the related

582
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:09,190
communication true to favor some corpus

583
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,080
so they first agent sure supports that

584
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,150
should suppose they're just a mute have

585
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,790
data at a way we want and have seen we

586
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:22,390
use real device to perform fuzzy we we

587
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:25,690
finally chose brother as as the LDH 5/8

588
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:28,060
inch in fact we to ever build a Linux

589
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,840
volume outlaw hood to try and try to a

590
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,149
father to wire FL part due to is hard to

591
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,149
emulate as the environmental it needs

592
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,100
and another Friday is easy to control

593
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:41,260
with way person and in fact our morning

594
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,120
to also yours person to console to

595
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,790
console a db2 received locks and a

596
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,620
processing and processing ISM also also

597
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,960
with the charge script we can usually

598
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,879
exchange our file in script to add or

599
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,540
remove and functions that we want to

600
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,540
fast or occurred or accurately control

601
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:01,180
album Italian policy like in racing the

602
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,060
probability of our data stream to be

603
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,360
meted skipping some speche specify the

604
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:09,310
bus imposter imposter da thing when we

605
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,620
thought that path should be should not

606
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:16,629
be added and as a is the manage the

607
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,489
monitor should sure analyst can collect

608
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,860
enough logs on time and allocating crash

609
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,620
- Lakhan encroach punch and it should

610
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,840
also come on track it's stereos in order

611
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,939
to restart target when a tiger de hija

612
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,699
ohyeah or in some other unexpected

613
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,070
stairs and also sends to the Android

614
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,160
debug debug bridge demo for your space

615
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:40,340
Valley the lot of project the lock put

616
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,490
provided by the a DVD is enough for us

617
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,939
to collect logs their cost by isin and

618
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:50,600
simply simple as you can see all our

619
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:54,020
lines begin with this and and analyze

620
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,240
this will we just reach out to test

621
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,450
these two lines we will get all the logs

622
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,070
about one aboard one garage and and then

623
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,960
what we understand what is the monitor

624
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:06,200
should do is to locate or crash point

625
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,240
best sounds best on that's not a lot

626
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,429
function you know caustic before is them

627
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,040
and we also we also use these we also

628
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:16,760
use these to reduce to to remove the

629
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,920
duplicate crashes and also the tombstone

630
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,470
corresponding to our crash will be put

631
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:26,690
out to be started for further manual

632
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:28,429
examine and finally and finally it's the

633
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,100
reproducer we all know that a good

634
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:33,380
father should recorder the data that

635
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,959
caused the crash for for researcher to

636
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,300
report to reproduce the crash what we do

637
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,240
is to store data when we'd had it like

638
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,190
extremes to files with time staff so

639
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,179
when a crash happens we could just

640
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:51,110
really means that means these logs to

641
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:58,580
get the token to the data that they're

642
00:32:51,110 --> 00:33:01,250
cause of crash so this is the overview

643
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,379
of our commodious of illustrates where

644
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,330
the strategies we've talked before and

645
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,179
as a controller contender for a client

646
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,770
where provides person which takes the

647
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:12,020
responsibility to make sure that a

648
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,540
retractor is being hooked on a bee and

649
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,690
the file in strict and under the pollens

650
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,580
script is executed correctly and the

651
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,200
money to Ana under the monitor text

652
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,240
response to collect a lock

653
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,490
trash dump and a remove duplicate crash

654
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,830
and we also have the controller to make

655
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,830
sure to make sure that the tag dealer

656
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,379
life and also here is the ad BD plays

657
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,399
the a DVD players are very important

658
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,650
for Almonte used for because almond your

659
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,900
locket to refill log from device and

660
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:46,880
also put a new correct tombstones from a

661
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:48,919
device via ADB and finally and finally

662
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,190
here some tips and a practice in our

663
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,140
implementation and about papers user

664
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,299
choose the function we've passed and in

665
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:58,280
order to tell Fred in order to let Fred

666
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:00,500
I can find these functions we should

667
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,330
also change them to to be the globe

668
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,400
available symbols so as you can see we

669
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,610
just added a computer prefix to each

670
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,480
functions and is only also funds that

671
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:14,600
find that they the API the API the find

672
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,480
find by find by exporting them provide

673
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,790
the by Fred I will sometimes give us our

674
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,290
own function address which could not be

675
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:25,070
used for with hidden data

676
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:29,270
so finally we found that we just used we

677
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,879
just reuse the I mean that expose we

678
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,139
just use this to get also to get all the

679
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:35,089
symbols you know you know and so

680
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:37,369
anything we just compare of other names

681
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:45,409
to find the to find out the address and

682
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:48,950
this view and this works well and also

683
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,300
and also as we are we I said before in

684
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:52,750
the comunicados there are a lot of

685
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:56,510
places that I use this way took and

686
00:34:52,750 --> 00:35:00,580
maybe you use this way to get the

687
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:03,470
Terra's address not just a wire not just

688
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,009
not just a wire or a data field in the

689
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,319
PTR swear by this so we ever trying to

690
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:12,260
just use it that are referred in ptit

691
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,109
our final reforms and sometimes it will

692
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,450
not point to a right address our data so

693
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:19,609
what we do is so what we doing is that

694
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,220
if the code if the code cattle are

695
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:24,650
dressed by this we also we also to it by

696
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,279
this in our in our filing you know

697
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,280
foreign script

698
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,170
yeah and as you can see the least funky

699
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,640
in the l2c acid is your data it just

700
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:40,430
which asked the you of this mess

701
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:43,558
together together a real ton of this and

702
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,899
ok enough here my part is done and now

703
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:51,569
it's my colleague Lance we also use a

704
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:54,960
Cano Cano space body okay my name is

705
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:57,839
nice John no net goes through the color

706
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,940
space fasten in this part I will show

707
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,578
you how we use the passive fast for

708
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,460
vulnerability discovery we will go

709
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,660
through each of them and finally we will

710
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,390
have a crash case study

711
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:14,940
ok now let's started a topic as you are

712
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,538
in the above figure we can say that

713
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:22,470
enjoys the Garifuna team discussed the

714
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:25,069
variability from January to March 2019

715
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,868
each of them had a lot of color

716
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:31,499
vulnerabilities and in the vulnerability

717
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:35,759
disclosure in March silly e20

718
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:38,910
one night - xur - OH - v Camp Kinser

719
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:42,599
good access of the Pixar serious mobile

720
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:44,640
phones and therefore the research on the

721
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:48,509
Android color vulnerability is very

722
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:55,529
important now let's talk about passive

723
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:58,850
fast temperature so how to

724
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:01,350
she pacifist firstly we need to color

725
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:04,020
interceptor the Interceptor is built

726
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:07,380
into the color as a part of the color

727
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,259
and has a good durability where Adina's

728
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,960
accept her you need to pay it into what

729
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,620
concern considering whether the mobile

730
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,900
phone is problem booted you need you

731
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,859
need to start a starts to wait for fast

732
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:26,550
to avoid this problem after you flashes

733
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:30,110
of color when with interceptor so true

734
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:32,790
which was the Linux system korekiyo or

735
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:35,910
also a better method is to add a new

736
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:39,750
cell phone call to do it that may damage

737
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:42,299
the stability of the system so we still

738
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:46,110
use the key function that have already

739
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:50,310
in the system call the main advantages

740
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:53,070
are the number one the owner of this

741
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:56,370
function is the color and it has a good

742
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:59,910
stability number two the function can be

743
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,810
called directing in the geological

744
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,370
command which is easy to use number

745
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,790
three the function has two parameters

746
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:11,850
which can provide a variety of usages

747
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,240
such as transferring the future needs in

748
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,240
a color

749
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:23,190
so the filter needs in the cup to the

750
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:25,919
color as we all know the key function

751
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:29,100
has two parameters that one is processed

752
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,340
PID and the other what is the signal

753
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:35,330
after testing testing we found that the

754
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:41,090
value of the signal is between 0 and the

755
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:44,940
64 that it can not be a 32-bit or 64-bit

756
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:48,080
address however with can't use hex

757
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,750
decimal value to transfer data so we can

758
00:38:48,080 --> 00:39:02,970
only use the value of the signal from 0

759
00:38:51,750 --> 00:39:05,940
to 15 here then the filter needs

760
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,970
information is reserved in the color but

761
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,610
by the color as shown in the figure

762
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:14,640
since the signal only transmitted four

763
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:20,040
bits each time if you want to change for

764
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,350
32 bits you need to reserve a times so

765
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,230
that it can transfer the command code of

766
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:32,920
the Iowa State or function that you want

767
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:35,320
to filter to the color after having

768
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,810
inception and the phazon treasure when

769
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,510
you look sad strategist as follows

770
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,330
number one without changing the lens of

771
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:47,380
the parameter number two modifying the

772
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:50,650
fixed number bytes in the parameter for

773
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,990
example modify one ace lights in the

774
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,740
parameter number three only modifies a

775
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,020
bit or one part in the parameter and the

776
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,770
number for modifying the random number

777
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:06,190
of bytes in Perm in the parameter and

778
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:09,490
numb Phi using the fall group to perform

779
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:12,430
bottom multi fast in order to reduce the

780
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,580
influence of context switching when

781
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,790
fastened and number six starts the fast

782
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:22,870
frequency for each target function such

783
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:25,480
as thousands because the fast frequency

784
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:28,299
will affect the discovery of some bar

785
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:31,390
variability for example we found that

786
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,560
increasing the valence frequency will

787
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:42,430
lead to more om type

788
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:45,700
vulnerabilities when fuzzing but to nd

789
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:48,580
need to prepare first new we must know

790
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,419
how to open Kissin in the color and then

791
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:55,660
if the color panic we need to know where

792
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,390
the panic not is start cracking the

793
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,660
panic north of Android color we need to

794
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:06,330
know first the panic nog of annual color

795
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,980
is taught in the CSS restore directory

796
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:15,940
there are three files in the directory

797
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:21,490
and as showing in a future and and the

798
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:27,109
DME SD I am obviously of fire is a panic

799
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:29,229
log fire collage

800
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:32,749
sanitizer is many used to detect

801
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:35,660
out-of-bounds memory access and I used a

802
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:38,629
very nice memory google provides kisum

803
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:42,319
configuration file named build dot

804
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:45,319
config kissin in color four point nine

805
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,170
point nine six which can be used

806
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:51,440
directly when we build color source code

807
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,589
after building successful successful as

808
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:59,150
julen in a picture the kisaeng will have

809
00:41:54,589 --> 00:42:02,239
us send more vulnerabilities well

810
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:06,799
prepared Colo with in the saboteur and

811
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:10,069
flash it into pbr3 to attach the

812
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:13,099
touchscreen doesn't work and the wind

813
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:17,720
companion enjoy source code we found

814
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:20,839
that was a awesome repressed kill files

815
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,359
are repackage repackage it into the

816
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:27,470
window directory button on the old

817
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,529
window dot IMG file generator that is to

818
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:37,220
say l SP does not generate the window

819
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:40,430
dot IMG file but use that default vendor

820
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:43,118
dot mg provided by Google so the

821
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:48,640
repressed kill file files is not

822
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:52,150
packaged into the window dot OMG

823
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:56,150
so the touch screen does not work

824
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:59,799
attempting to use is mode command to not

825
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:03,109
the models in vendor nib borders

826
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:05,960
directory and found out that y field

827
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:08,989
there are two problems the one is

828
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:14,900
required key not available and the other

829
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:17,509
one is excused format error but how to

830
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,700
be always if the solution is to me

831
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:22,759
removes a cigarette or syndication of

832
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,220
the color and the modified of fires in

833
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:30,710
the window dot mg that provided by

834
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:34,578
Google nasta bellow not not not least

835
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:37,910
will need to turn off the DPM favorite

836
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:42,130
chatting otherwise done deal vendor

837
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,129
thought mg will feel too loud

838
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:52,720
it's a instrument to louder on kill

839
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:56,859
files the color attacks the interface is

840
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,020
showing in the future as our drivers can

841
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:05,230
be used as our attacking the face such

842
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:08,230
as cosa come before l2 + k GS l and so

843
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:11,589
on you can also choose down memory

844
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:18,220
operate operation functions such as copy

845
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:21,970
from user memory copy and map that he

846
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:26,348
always used achilles co-driver as target

847
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:29,379
attack interface why we choose K G as

848
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:33,460
well as your in the figure on creatures

849
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:37,240
as many inquired by OpenGL ES it may

850
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:41,440
it's many responsible for in rendering

851
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:44,410
of 3d images hmm in Android and it's

852
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,980
many used in games which remain in 3d

853
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:52,480
since however the implementation is of

854
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:57,040
cages in color is done by open GREs the

855
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:01,000
OpenGL ES is al there which is provided

856
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,890
by kokom and has no source code the next

857
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,900
layer is the kid yourselves relieve the

858
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:11,980
RO Java in the color and is open to us

859
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:17,200
the driver in the form is div k gr 3d

860

00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:38,589
kg ourselves reduce your driver and

866
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,010
found that there are a large number of

867
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:45,190
security issues as can be seen from the

868
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:48,520
above picture there are many uf4

869
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:52,329
abilities in congestion which vary hum

870
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,190
for an unlicensed this variability has

871
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:57,910
found that this were

872
00:45:54,190 --> 00:46:02,740

874
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,009
back to K just L strategies his trips

875
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:12,220
there are many such security issues for

876
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:20,020
example integer integer overflow

877
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:25,299

cages a pacifist framework that includes

887
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:04,120
enjoy colors set up process firstly the

888
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:07,780
boot another will start the color and

889
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:10,299
the passive device tree to the color the

890
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:21,880
color excuses and start color function

891
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:25,530
to initialize and and it's unfair it's

892
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:30,160
travel cages are initialize operate

893
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:33,460
process it and as shown in the figure

894
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,009
it's a job Trevor uncle Jocelyn is nice

895
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,500
in processing its Java in the color has

896
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:40,900
an initializing function which is

897
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,120
responsible for registering

898
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,380
registering and now being the driver and

899
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:50,440
the initialization function is called in

900
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,970
to in it cost function so the Arcadia's

901
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:57,490
they also reduce your underserved

902
00:47:51,970 --> 00:48:01,270
application can use the Java felony our

903
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:05,200
fathom idea is modifying the contents

906
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:15,849
and the parameters can be passed in from

907
00:48:10,029 --> 00:48:18,880
the users best as you like future is

908
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:23,799
dark ages they are function core for a

00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:29,259
directorate's when we use it before we

911
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:32,470
should open it first me anything we will

912
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:36,130
get a handle that can be used by iOS 8

913
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:40,899
elf method in the color it will go into

914
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:44,380
this core IO CTL first after some simple

915
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:50,740
parameters and checking it will enter to

916
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:53,019
verify our job and in this function some

917
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,930
distributing work will happend that if

918
00:48:53,019 --> 00:49:00,669
there is no matching command called it's

919
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:04,319
well into the VSS lzl function and the

920
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:05,970
zell is a very important function and

921
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:10,150
well called

922
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:13,000
unlocked Alzado which is available to

923
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:16,660
other Java developers to implement

924
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,460
improvements and the cages are also just

925
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,578
one of the implementation of this

926
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:25,440
function family the function core

927
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:31,029
interlock a DSL 3d0 drivers including

928
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:34,240
certified functions and in cages or also

929
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:37,000
GL helper method it will determine which

930
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,990
function to core based on workman code

931
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,059
there is a function structure then cages

932
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:48,430
or I also G of F UN says including in

933
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:50,680
function name and document code that is

934
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:52,839
to say we can create function name of

935
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,828
our command code according to this

936
00:49:52,839 --> 00:50:00,490
structure button must use same disk and

937
00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:02,849
our offense a message called the target

938
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,848
function

939
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:08,439
the whole the whole coolest best faster

940
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,529
a mohawk is joined in the figure it's

941
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:14,379
used as a as more mud and the

942
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:17,559
communicating through the enjoy bug and

943
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:21,130
bridge the whole process is divided into

944
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:27,519
four steps firstly and started a fat

945
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:31,059
fast program with pet VCO kill 17 one

946
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:33,399
command because of we have modified the

947
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:37,630
kill function in a color and in the PID

948
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:41,829
equals one is in each process it cannot

949
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:47,499
be killed so we add some code work mmm

950
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:50,769
when PID is one and then start some 3d

951
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:53,529
girls or program to for the cages or

952
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:57,069
function certainly fasten and the cross

953
00:50:53,529 --> 00:51:02,349
color and finally monitor and the

954
00:50:57,069 --> 00:51:05,739
automatic new achieved pan banknotes as

955
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:11,949
you--as in Nepal picture it's the system

956
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:14,559
core it's a system it's a system costs

957
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:17,140
steak of the kids ESL Java which

958
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,169
includes user space and the color space

959
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:24,129
the NASA side is functions that's the

960
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:27,999
dynamic member neveress exported and the

961
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:33,609
zone result is a system core stack of kg

962
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:39,299
as ioctl cpu obj a log function which is

963
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:44,140
triggered by vh w I thought as all and

964
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:53,829
in another coaster is shown in the

965
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:57,788
future on general the upper body will

966
00:51:53,829 --> 00:52:02,589
call the GSL head functions of the GS or

967
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:04,569
thought as well but sometimes our city

968
00:52:02,589 --> 00:52:08,078
al khattab function will also be

969
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:11,380
recalled directing such as also geo kzs

970
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:14,949
o memory free families I also G of

971
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:16,869
function is called by the GS l d DD

972
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:22,450
control function to access

973
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:25,660
KJ's Java in the color as shown in the

974
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:29,649
figure is color panel caustic and the

975
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:33,129
crash occurs in kg as the Isle City ltob

976
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:35,700
geo log function now let's talk about

977
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:39,519
how to make the color passive as

978
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,769
automation SAS automation server is

979
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,319
deployed on the PC and the communicate

980
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:47,828
with mobile phone through a DB the main

981
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:56,890
org of the server is chewin in the

982
00:52:47,829 --> 00:53:00,339
picture in the color fast process we

983
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:02,799
need to know the status of fast for

984
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:06,430
example you can view the color code

985
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:10,619
coverage when thousand and send out the

986
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:14,049
code branch that proposal fatimata raged

987
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:16,900
filtering the functions that have been

988
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:19,180
found or no need to fast it can help us

989
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:22,539
change our strategies to get a better

990
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:25,269
performance because of if it is always

991
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:28,170
in the same or often in the same sum

992
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:31,299
function panic it will make our pacifist

993
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:38,710
unable to control continue to offend

994
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:41,200
other functions that may appear panic it

995
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:45,039
is what key cover looks next in other

996
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,279
and this is a simple idea unplugging

997
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,589
wrote in person that can marks the

998
00:53:48,279 --> 00:53:53,529
erased block and the generator attacks

999
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:56,799
report fire about function functions

1000
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:58,900
coverage you can also use them not hard

1001
00:53:56,799 --> 00:54:05,799
to show the coverage it's well more

1002
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:08,319
beautiful it looks necklace on this bar

1003
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:11,259
chart shows the first aiders of kgs

1004
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:14,769
release your the left side indicates the

1005
00:54:11,259 --> 00:54:18,749
number of crises the right side shows

1006
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:18,749
the number of each phasing function

1007
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:25,600
as you lie in the picture

1008
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:28,360
its strategy runs out starting different

1009
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,810
3d games to improve the code coverage

1010
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:34,180
but there is this is a disadvantage the

1011
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:37,029
coning frequency of many methods is

1012
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,540
you're not high which cannot achieve a

1013
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:42,790
good fast performance however in the

1014
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:46,420
passive as a high method Churchill rate

1015
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:48,970
is required to send out as many panels

1016
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:52,240
as possible so we need to send out some

1017
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:55,029
strategies to improve the fast frequency

1018
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,939
of each method there are two ways to do

1019
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:01,990
this the first method is add a for loop

1020
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:04,270
to its function that fast reached so

1021
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,729
that you can increase the fit and fast

1022
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:10,210
frequency by modifying the parameters of

1023
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:13,180
the forum the second method is to add an

1024
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:16,360
active children program we will add the

1025
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:19,149
fastest record in puzzle files wherever

1026
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,850
a new function is fast but record its

1027
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:24,730
command code and parameters and then use

1028
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:28,440
the um record data to achieve the

1029
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:33,040
purpose of active children by retinal

1030
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:39,490
tree job program program it's out of

1031
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:42,279
other for loop and however the active

1032
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:45,729
region method has also a disadvantage

1033
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,640
that is the first function is single but

1034
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:52,150
cannot associate the context of each

1035
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:54,339
function course so that it can only find

1036
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,770
the variability in the internal

1037
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,320
processing of single function and cannot

1038
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:03,400
associate it with other functions such

1039
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:07,420
as say they eat two one six three eight

1040
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:10,870
four two the variability involves two

1041
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:14,410
cages or functions that need to be used

1042
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:20,500
together so it combines the two ways to

1043
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:25,890
achieve better fast performance this is

1044
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:29,500
a main part of 72 or once x-38 for to

1045
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:30,900
pure pure cell it can be seen that the

1046
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,630
variability is cast

1047
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:41,160
I risk on condition now let's talk about

1048
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:45,089
crash case study just one person that's

1049
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:48,808
a cage es el sitio CPU and the Arak I

1050
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:53,130
diamond method have a variability is of

1051
00:56:48,809 --> 00:57:03,650
Sibiu mm Arak method under the

1052
00:56:53,130 --> 00:57:07,799
parameters we can control various up kid

1053
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:11,579
it's law first called about this case

1054
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:15,059
and case two is variability in kids Ohio

1055
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:17,339
said oh hello kid mmm a rock method and

1056
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:20,160
insecure is a GPU memory rock engine

1057
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:23,369
mastered and is an issue is happened in

1058
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:33,029
this method it's also called about this

1059
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:33,539
case funny fan power okay that's why

1060
00:57:33,029 --> 00:57:38,039
thank you

1061
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:44,089
yeah certain questions please give a big

1062
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:44,089
applause to thank you

1063
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,700
you
