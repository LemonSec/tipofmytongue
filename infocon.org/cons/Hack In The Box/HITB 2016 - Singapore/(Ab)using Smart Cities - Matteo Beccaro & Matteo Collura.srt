1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,969
thank you

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:24,240
so okay let's start first of all thank
you all for the time being here and

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,839
listen to us and we will store you a lot
of time just a little bit of an hour so

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,309
let's start with a little bit of
introduction I'm matakara i'm founder a

5
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,559
city or at the opposing force which is
our small company totally which focus on

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,339
physical security so are our building
and cities these are my to render you

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,940
want to keep in touch have questions
feedback from representation of whatever

8
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:02,849
I am Kahlua and just got a regular of
science last month and so still a

9
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,409
student and apply for a master class in
technologies for ICT in Italy

10
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,729
well its international program of study
and my twitter as well is displayed on

11
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,570
the screen so if you want to follow me I
will appreciate

12
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,059
so now we will start speaking about our
research and i will not work my friend

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:35,310
ok so before starting with the real talk
I want just to introduce you this

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,790
organization the we join this
organization may and it's about securing

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,200
more cities that are and what the
organization purposes is to provide

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,140
documentation for city's decision makers
and vendors about what could be the

17
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,240
issue if they not properly implement
security so the organization is as I

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,689
said before profit and everyone can join
and help with the program provided

19
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,549
documentation right documentation or try
to put in contact with the proper people

20
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,569
like vendors etc so that's our agenda
for today we start with a little bit of

21
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,200
introduction about what is more CD
without the components of us more cities

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,750
and etc and then we focus on
transportation system we provide free

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,349
samples free samples studies three case
studies are simple city in Italy and the

24
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,510
purpose of this talk is to provide our
method process smart cities in general

25
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:45,510
and we will apply this matter in our
case study so let's start with what is

26
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,440
our city

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,400
what is Marcis more cities are as a
composer by several elements as you can

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,110
see we can have the smarts waste
management transportation system water

29
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,940
management surveillance energy
management smart metering exceptional

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:15,480
our talk today we focus on smartest
rotation system sorry I drink alot of

31
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:24,569
water okay yeah let's say that much
protection system what is Marcus

32
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,659
petition system every element of a city
we try to divide it in the smaller

33
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,840
elements and also the market positioning
system can be divided in several

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,150
elements we have as much traffic control
with more partying streetlight public

35
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:46,799
transportation etc and the or each
element communicate with each other in

36
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,890
different ways in our experience we
found mostly true system

37
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,950
the first one is when we have a PhD each
element of the system which communicate

38
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:09,569
with zone control system for example let
me see if I can hear you have traffic

39
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,060
control and system like for example
sensor which detects traffic from the

40
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,899
cars or if they are in a jam or whatever
that communicating his own as much

41
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,460
traffic control system

42
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,690
then the smart traffic control system
communicates with the central back and

43
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,360
which is this one and the same applies
for every other system for example

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,979
lighting control different kind of
system for parking etc and then the

45
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,659
central system communicate information
to the season because the N the point of

46
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,889
having a smart city is to provide better
information to the citizen is to provide

47
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,280
a martyr information so I alcohol
traffic for example and to our reduce

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:05,159
and costs so the other system is
composed a similar so every also here we

49
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,560
have a control system for each element
of this most of the varsity but these

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,090
elements communicate directly to the
cities and and directly each other to

51
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:25,859
each other so okay and again this season
either center of it at least when we

52
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,840
speak about transportation system

53
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,289
let's go more in detail as much a
petition system is composed by mostly

54
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,909
free sector the private transportation
sector the public transportation sector

55
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:45,840
in the shares protection sector is the
last one is the new new new West we have

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,340
bike-sharing car sharing etc on our
thought today we will focus on my own

57
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,830
bike Sheree and for each system we have
to divide again and find this schema

58
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:07,289
schema provides our method to test the
device itself so we have a physical data

59
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,360
from the world outside which are
detected and parts

60
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,909
let's say from the sensor then send back
to the cloud domain and codomain is like

61
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:22,680
the the brain of our system which
analyzed the data received from the

62
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,940
sensor and can provide information to
the client remain and I'm send commands

63
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,719
actions to the other regiments for
example if the

64
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,070
traffic sensors that out of traffic they
can modify the behavior of the lighting

65
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,659
system that's why before we said that
each system must communicate with each

66
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,960
other so we try to apply this schema for
our systems and try to see where their

67
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
weak points of it

68
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:06,240
ok let's start with the first case study
this is a all of these freakin studies

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,060
are real-world example so they are found
in the while the city neatly I won't

70
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:20,610
make any names during the recorded
presentation there is a Q&A session so

71
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:29,010
their parking meter device itself is are
more device you can buy at any shops and

72
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:35,550
you can actually put credit on the
device recharge device in two different

73
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,860
ways the first one you can recharge it
online so you just connect the device

74
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,140
itself to your computer go to the
website of the vendor and select the

75
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,840
amount you want to charge the device or
you can go to some shops are mostly

76
00:07:51,840 --> 00:08:00,030
tobacco shops or supermarket and bring
the device to the Americans and the

77
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,539
dimension itself will charge your device
so you have two different ways and once

78
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,250
you have credit on your device you can
turn it on putting your card and select

79
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,669
the city you want to pay the parking
because the device itself is available

80
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,840
in 40 different cities in it at the
moment and growing and once you have

81
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,369
selected the city and the correct fee
for your place it automatically the

82
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:33,150
crease your credit overtime so every
mean it's start removing credits and and

83
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,150
the inspector for check if you are
paying correctly or not as two different

84
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,959
ways

85
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,770
the first one is a throughout let's call
it online database in which you can from

86
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,760
the device that you can read the serial
number the inspector can check the

87
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,900
serial numbers credit or not if the
device associated the serial number as

88
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,209
credit or not or three display which is
the most common use three explains that

89
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:06,780
the device itself the show different
information on the display for example

90
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:13,740
shows your fares own shows that when you
started the payment he showed that the

91
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,550
fair you're paying etc and the inspector
can check with the information match the

92
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,120
place you are so we started our analysis
with the extracting the femur because

93
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,130
there were several debug interface we
see later and from the film analysis we

94
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,570
found there were no integrity checks
encryption office location in the female

95
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,680
again can be easily extracted both from
the device and from the back end during

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,800
an OTA update so i started the femur we
could modify the femur and reupload the

97
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,170
femur on the device and that means we
can like for example avoid the payment

98
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,500
part and just display the correct
information to their respectful as i

99
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,330
said before there were several debug
interface left open by the developer so

100
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,770
i don't know if you can read but there
where I jtag poor and SW deport we used

101
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,060
for extracting feel more and modify
behavior device and try to understand

102
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,060
more important information i show you
later

103
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,830
and another thing we try to understand
what the communication part so this is

104
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,540
with the information retrieved from the
femur and from the bug interface we are

105
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,270
you modified our schema before in this
way so we have the edge domain with the

106
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,839
party device which communicates through
USB to the cloud domain

107
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,890
cloud domain is used for like i said
before remotely charge and generate

108
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:55,399
invoice updates etc and the cloud domain
communicate the gsm to decline his

109
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,240
pecker application and the clients
replication can also communicate with

110
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,230
the party device sorry through NFC the
reason FC interface which at the moment

111
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:14,209
is not very used the problems we found
during the communication analysis was

112
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:18,170
there is no that validation between
their advice and the cloud me in the

113
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:23,449
clouds of our ethical appliance store
and the inspector as all the trust in

114
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,399
the edge that we provide this device
provided information so the edge device

115
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,470
can provide the correct information

116
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:37,100
the inspector is ok with that there is
no other checks will make so since there

117
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,660
is no integrity checks no encryption and
authentication checks we could actually

118
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:49,880
for fake information sent from into the
device by the flood appliance and using

119
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,730
our losing the day before information
from the femur and from the debug

120
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:03,740
interface we found what was the formula
for calculating the the correct feet to

121
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,570
pay so that's the form rock and as I
said before some of the information

122
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,120
displayed on the device are actually
present in this formula and the

123
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,149
information of the price per time unit
and the second you have elapsed from

124
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,760
when you started payment some
information are usually set to 0 which

125
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,860
is the mining fee that's the meme
amounted to pay or just starting the

126
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,149
parking there but there is a 1
information which is usually not display

127
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:42,589
which is the frequency the frequency is
the frequency for each for which you

128
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:47,660
have to pay the price per titanium so
for example if there is one hour the

129
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,399
frequencies one if you have to pay the
fare the price per time unit each half

130
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,160
an hour the frequency will be 2x

131
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,660
and so this information is not displayed
and as you can see this is a

132
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,019
multiplication so if we set the
frequency 20 and we can do that because

133
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:12,620
we can forge data from the black end to
the device itself and this data is also

134
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,019
composed by configuration files so we
can just modify any of these data as we

135
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:25,100
want we can set frequency 20 and then
our whole formula becomes 0 so that's

136
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,649
what we call our same rod for the device
itself it's a very easy act to do

137
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:36,529
actually you can write a small appliance
for that and modified in devising a

138
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:41,540
couple of seconds and then you can like
reset it or with everyone they won't pay

139
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,689
any any parking fee for 40 cities in
Italy first and some of them are major

140
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:54,740
city and not interesting thing we found
out later and during the process of a

141
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:04,339
disclosure the the city as publisher
document which a informer for how many

142
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:09,290
money they make from parking system and
it was like 26 million dollars

143
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:17,149
oh I understand there may be a market
for a cadaver ice like this and that and

144
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:24,290
that's just one city of the 40 in which
device available so i probably the word

145
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,719
now to michael lee for the other two
case studies the bike sharing one in the

146
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,189
pump public transportation one thank you

147
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,959
okay so okay thank you

148
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,469
so let's move on with the bike sharing
and as regards to share transportation

149
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:55,879
systems so basically we can divide our
analysis where we focus our analysis on

150
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:02,300
bike sharing dividing into three steps
the first step involves the unlocking

151
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,420
over the bike from his its own station

152
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,060
the second one while you ride the bike
so it's not so interesting from the

153
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,060
point of view of security and the first
step

154
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,779
he is when you unlock again the bike in
the station so let's start from the

155
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,899
first one we said and as you can see
from the picture very essentially two

156
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:33,769
ways to unlock a bite from the station
so using an NFC card and the other one

157
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:43,579
is using the mobile application from the
company that provides this service so

158
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:51,260
here is the station and as you can see
on the top there is the NFC reader and

159
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,230
so there you can pass your card and
unlock the bike if your card is enabled

160
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:04,070
of course and as regards to the mobile
application it needs a gps position

161
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:10,850
because you need to be in close to dish
the station and then you can select the

162
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,060
the number of the station to unlock the
bike but let's start our analysis from

163
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,670
the mobile application so first of all
we tried to compile it and something

164
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:32,089
messy cum came out because code was not
investigated and moreover they were the

165
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:35,540
end of credential the administration for
the answer

166
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:43,519
prudential where hard-coded inside so
that's quite a pain i mean because if

167
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,579
you try to pull up with those
credentials

168
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:53,449
well essentially you can do whatever you
want you can create new users charge

169
00:16:53,449 --> 00:17:01,040
credit on them unlocked bikes credit
card information of the use yes we don't

170
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,870
say that huh

171
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:10,010
and moreover some SQL injections were
found them but we did not exploit them

172
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,780
because with the cleanup

173
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,220
yes we cannot go further so we can
review it

174
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,319
well we can let Umi imaging what is
inside those system

175
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:29,300
let's move to the NFC part now and ok
it's a buffet microlight card

176
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:36,500
essentially they're all the data sectors
are empty and ODB is empty too

177
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,570
so let's try to imagine what is the only
sensitive information inside the fair

178
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:48,379
utilized card and have a look inside
this rectangle them please raise your

179
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:56,540
hand if you have the idea of what is
inside this rectangle no one got it

180
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:09,260
okay well it is the uid and just printed
in Reverse way so they easy you that the

181
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,750
process of finding the uid but what's
the problem of this being this the only

182
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,370
information the only sensitive
information needed to unlock a bike if

183
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:26,750
someone can get close to that card and
can scan it you can just easily clone to

184
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:37,130
a meter clone and so you steal someone
else card and well it is not so not good

185
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,520
thing because if you can get a cart of
every people in a room for example I

186
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,010
don't know you you passed close to one
person and you can his wallet with your

187
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,020
mobile phone and you can steal those
kind of information and they bikes

188
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,290
example university yeah the university's
varies everyone has a buscar university

189
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:08,360
crowded so one in order to start
spending every 1ic it's a very hard

190
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,389
issue and ok

191
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:19,429
as regards the secondary steps that we
found some physical issues because for

192
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,690
this is written from the point of view
of the station in order to find out if

193
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,850
the the bike as

194
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:33,230
being locked correctly there is a sensor
on the hook and if you try to slightly

195
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:41,419
move the bike from the station but just
a little bit after 30 seconds the

196
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:47,990
unlocking process goes timeout but since
the station believes the device the bike

197
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,350
is inserted is still inserted when it
locks it doesn't actually lock the bike

198
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:02,149
so you can easily extract it and the
station believes it is still inside and

199
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,799
that's a problem because you cannot lock
the bike and what steal it

200
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,719
the problem is that a posteriori after
that if you leave the bike to another

201
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,970
station of course the system will detect
the same bike into different stations so

202
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,880
it will be a problem and he will the
system will recognize the error and

203
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,990
another problem is that if someone else
leaves his own bikes inside the decision

204
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,970
where you told the other bike the system
will detect the two bikes in the same

205
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,159
station so it will get an error but the
point is that the problem a priority is

206
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,610
not fixed and so you can if you steal a
card of someone else and you've got and

207
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,709
you go stealing bikes

208
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,110
the point is that the the the company
will go looking for

209
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:03,169
not you but them the guy you stole it
the card so it is a another important

210
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,770
issue we found one of those bike 500
kilometers away

211
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:15,950
yes and I don't know oh yeah who brought
the bike 500 ok so those are the the

212
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,320
main issues about the bike sharing so
let's move to the the plot of the public

213
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:29,010
transportation systems and as regards
this research we divided the land

214
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:37,020
into two main architectures the the
first one is we called offline system

215
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:44,190
because we will see later and the second
one online systems it is this difference

216
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:51,000
regards essentially the the way the
devices are communicating with a second

217
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,860
and we will see now so let's start from
the fly system in this kind of system we

218
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:06,149
have ourselves with our tug and IC card
and we can essentially get on the main

219
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:14,550
transportation vehicles so passes major
on drums and those devices are connected

220
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:24,030
to a mean man cloud and this cloud is
connected to a blacklist of two IDs

221
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:29,399
because when you're running out the
rights on your ticket ticket must be

222
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,550
blacklisted but this communication is
just one way so the cloud is

223
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:41,100
communicating in some way maybe a
certain time with the black list but

224
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:48,659
there is no life check from the black
list to the other vehicles and 44 this

225
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,870
architecture we found out too many
vulnerabilities the first one we call

226
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:04,050
block attack and essentially it involves
a nice exploit about making read only a

227
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:10,440
page on your ticket and this page is the
page where you store the rights left on

228
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,560
your tickets so if you are locking the
correct beat on any failure to light

229
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,389
ticket you can make read-only the page
where the rights are stored so

230
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:30,330
essentially you you make your multiple
right ticket unlimited for life and it

231
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:38,850
is well it is easy to be fixed and
Justin into let's say to check if those

232
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:47,070
beats are we have been locked and but
this kind of check is not so implemented

233
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,050
well in our city they implemented this
Jack saw this is not valid anymore but

234
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,280
after yeah after an hour discord yeah
and not acknowledge not

235
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:04,380
yeah they didn't even say thank you so
let's move to the next one okay this is

236
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,980
nicer I think time attack because if you
find the place where the timestamp of

237
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:19,680
your of your stamp take it is toward you
and if you managed to reverse the how it

238
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,700
is included

239
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,040
I mean you find the the time of start
for The Times them to be evaluated you

240
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:33,720
can forge your own data times them and
you can write on the pages making your

241
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,870
ticket as if it was already stamped and
so you you don't even remove any right

242
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,419
because you got a ticket which is
already valid because you you wrote that

243
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:54,330
the date and the time in the correct way
and so this is quite nice I think and

244
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,970
the same not a sin

245
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,860
no thank you yeah same same story for
this other vulnerability after

246
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,199
disclosure they fix but no thank you

247
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:11,130
ok as regards the other architecture
which is the 1i system

248
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,430
ok in this case we have not a unilateral
contract unilateral channel of

249
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:23,070
communication from the cloud to the uid
black list but this blacklist can also

250
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:32,070
interact with Michael's life so how to
bypass this problem so direct

251
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:40,800
communication between the blacklist and
Michael's well if you try to exploit the

252
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:47,909
replay attack essentially you can clone
your ticket you're ready to be stamped

253
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:54,119
ticket you clone on-loan tug or you can
even use our

254
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:01,859
an emulator like the Hydra and you
emulate your ticket to be stamp then you

255
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:09,869
can stamp it and you reply back to the
original ticket to have a ready and

256
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:15,928
perfectly clean ticket to be used and
this is very difficult to be fixed

257
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:22,049
because even if you have a USB
blacklister if you try to forge in your

258
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:28,259
uid and you put inside the network is
since there is no whitelist and the

259
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:31,919
white list is very difficult to be
implemented because I just think about

260
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,369
if you go buying a new ticket that you
think it must be usable immediately

261
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:45,149
because it's new i already about and I i
want to have the possibility to use it

262
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:50,938
immediately so I white race must be very
well managed to be implemented and this

263
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:57,149
is not our case so if you fortune you
you ideas they can be easily injected in

264
00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:06,539
the network and you can easily fortunate
tickets and this is a well every big

265
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,549
issue and difficult to be fixed

266
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:15,809
we found those issues were found like
most of the city in Italy but after we

267
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:21,749
present those will be teased a lot of
people from abroad about this other

268
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:27,119
cities start bringing us the new T
concealer own their own transportation

269
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,899
system in their city so it was awesome
down here son

270
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,998
if you're around singapore share nice to
see them and we found the same innovate

271
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:43,859
is in cities like Moscow you see it's
like in some placing Vietnam us it was

272
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,749
from time to time surround sound was
remember about that and they change

273
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:53,879
something like putting some moderate on
the RTP some of these issues but i think

274
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:55,408
that by a taxi works there

275
00:27:55,409 --> 00:28:01,619
no it's the hardest to be fixed in South
America except for soul that's an

276
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,730
interesting case study to check

277
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,940
and just so what's next

278
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:18,110
about our research we just covered the
the smart transportation but but there

279
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:25,070
are still a lot of the environments to
be checked and so maybe the next one to

280
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:32,210
be smart cities to violence because
nowadays a lot of cameras that are used

281
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:39,020
to for example check the traffic but in
the sense of limited limited traffic

282
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,330
areas limited traffic zones don't know
if you have here in singapore maybe

283
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:51,559
there are some roads you cannot ride in
provided the you have maybe a special

284
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:56,660
permission and those kind of cameras
will detect your your plate and send you

285
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:03,559
a fine if you get in and maybe it would
be nice to to study how that mechanism

286
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,629
works so maybe you can intercept those
three styles letter

287
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,790
yeah we also working on some cameras for
us control in which cameras are

288
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,040
connected to some central system for the
cities and for like government the

289
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,470
government buildings a checkup so that
the plate to see if your car is

290
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:29,870
registered to that specific department
of the government if so they can open

291
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,549
the open your gate automatically and you
can go in and out and maybe the check

292
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:42,710
also your face and space of recognition
this kind of things and ok

293
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,100
as regards a water management

294
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:53,629
come to think about what happens if each
one of us has a monitored amount of

295
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:58,549
water to use for it on purpose or being
good

296
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:07,309
let's say what our disposal for four
people and if you can manage to you know

297
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:10,100
how it works

298
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,010
this kind of information are shared the
in I don't know which ways maybe they're

299
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,840
there will be some networks

300
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,049
and we can find this the communication
is secure and the problem here is that

301
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:28,789
we can see in two different ways from
our moneys perspective so try to avoid

302
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:35,779
payment of water and/or the second
perspective is more like our let's think

303
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:43,039
about soccer . of view in which you can
like close the water for ah so I don't

304
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,658
know a neighborhood city or stop by this
and we're trying to understand where the

305
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:57,169
cities are more worried about if about
the payment are probably more about the

306
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,809
blockage of the service blockage
original the day of service so imagine

307
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:06,529
probably also that one and that's an
interesting

308
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:16,010
yeah . will then the Smart City lighting
system this is maybe regards them the

309
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:22,279
management also traffic because if you
have a road which is mostly there are a

310
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:28,490
lot of cars even during well of course
maybe during late-night it is better to

311
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:36,320
to keep the lights on but maybe from if
you have a smaller road with not so many

312
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,379
cars that could be a nice way to switch
off the lights and save save some money

313
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,649
from the city . of view but think about
an attacker from an attacker point of

314
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,719
view if you can I don't know

315
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,000
switch off all the lights would be a
pain I mean and I what we saw is that

316
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,360
not only roads are using smartsitting
more lighting system but also a publix

317
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,840
buildings so the point here is not such
that you can turn off the lights of our

318
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,549
road but you can turn off the lights of
the building is also critical ones like

319
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:18,350
for example let's think about hospitals
think about governmental government

320
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,899
buildings for critical infrastructures
conference room some friends to our not

321
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:25,370
let's think about prison

322
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,879
yeah that's another example an
interesting example which got strong

323
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,820
energy

324
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,290
some seedy awareness yes and the
directly connected to this is the smart

325
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:44,879
traffic light system so just try to
imagine what will happen if you if you

326
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,610
first the green light to all the streets
here in the nearby eyes will be a lot of

327
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,530
crashes and we really don't want now
there is a paper about that and about

328
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:03,629
search made from his eyes in of the
organization I securing as much as

329
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,960
before in which they analyze the traffic
sensors and the sensor I used to control

330
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,050
indirectly control the lighting the
traffic light system so the they found

331
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,830
out that they could like for
communication between the sense to

332
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,659
render main system controller sensor and
communicate with the light system so

333
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,490
controlling the data from the sensor
today intrasystem equals to force the

334
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:36,270
traffic light as they as they want like
Don turn that green makeup if they want

335
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:42,330
to pass just turn on the traffic light
green on their way and such things up so

336
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,939
to make it could be very dangerous

337
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,210
it's an attacker can put and son it for
the militias one and the last point is

338
00:33:51,210 --> 00:34:03,060
what if we can hook up a whole city and
this is the the last the last . we will

339
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,150
need the will leave you and it's just 22
and our talk before ending though I like

340
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,410
to understand it three some of you with
experience about smart cities security

341
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:20,009
and they have any we the point is we add
up at all the pain and actually no in

342
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:27,780
vegas last mom about how can we create
more awareness around mercy security

343
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,150
how can we force let's say
decision-makers to understand the

344
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:37,260
problems and to work properly and during
the talk

345
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,400
the problem was the panel the problem
was that all the people in the

346
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,389
dependable

347
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,240
the security researcher or anyway
technical people so everyone said yes

348
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,868
that's a problem we need to create
awareness and the other guy yes it's a

349
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,919
problem we need to create awareness but
there was no communication beyond no no

350
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,118
no one from and no one was our decision
maker or someone from the government

351
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:07,470
someone from the event of some vendors
of Mercy these devices so we decided to

352
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:13,019
to ask during our conferences we had
that similar speech and that one last

353
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:17,308
month if there is someone from the
audience who can have that was an idea

354
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:22,319
of some connection to the to the
government vendors to who makes

355
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:30,240
decisions again i want to share their
faults or ideas or whatever but you have

356
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,779
to build this channel of communication
between oh please

357
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:41,010
technical and executive mostly flat
technical and some like bring idea how

358
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,170
to fix everything

359
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,220
yes so if there is someone here knows a
friend of a friend of a friends please

360
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:55,649
raise your right no one approached ok so

361
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,509
