00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,680
stage especially first so you guys get
it over with first but you have some

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,890
really amazing sessions and so with that

7
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,159
for the next two days as well thank you
very much but I'm ready to have a really

8
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,680
good time with you guys this morning so
thank you for getting up this morning

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,030
think you guys are having coffee tea
milk or water or vodka whatever it might

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,659
be

11
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,100
so to kind of kick things off and i'm
told i can only walk to hear so this

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,080
will be fun

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,000
my talk is more around I I fight for the
users and it's a prequel because we've

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,720
done a few of these talks before in so
in a star wars type fashion the prequel

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,820
should lead up to actually what the
actual talks end up being about I want

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,050
to have a little bit of fun with this
and I'm hoping that this translates

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,830
pretty well as far as a lot of this talk
is going to be a little bit about

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,179
western cinema and help funny hacking is
in western cinema

19
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,810
so who am i I'm stuck barbie on Twitter

20
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,670
my name's Aaron Jacobs is my my
real-life name is so many people like to

21
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,909
know because when i introduced myself a
sec barbie and bars it sounds really

22
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:53,400
strange but as we like to go through
credentials so I'm a consultant turned

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,130
director of information security turned
chief security officer turn chief

24
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,729
information officer at one point in my
life I did that for about seven years

25
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:09,060
and then I decided going back to
consulting was the logical step right so

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,030
I kind of with that goes through my
entire career started in consulting saw

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,170
a lot of organizations saw a lot of the
good the bad the ugly of what people

28
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,819
were doing insecurity i have the
opportunity to go in as the director of

29
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,709
information security and actually

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,460
build a program and then that that's
when i was able to kind of Traverse that

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,040
into chief security officer and good or
bad as a chief security officer they

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,700
actually decided out a better fit for
the chief information officer which was

33
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,709
a cool cool thing because as a chief
information officer as many of you might

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,270
know a lot of times they're detached
from security a lot of times the

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,510
security department feeds into them so
it was kind of neat to have an

36
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,030
organization where I got to push
security from the top down but as good

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,010
things often come to an end

38
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,859
going back into consulting seemed like
the more logical way that i can make a

39
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,360
larger impact but that all sounds fine
and good but that doesn't have a whole

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,410
lot of relevance to this talk so as far
as the credentials that are important

41
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,640
for this talk

42
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,950
it has to do with me being about a 13
year old little girl and starting as a

43
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,730
system of a BBS and that's how a lot of
us got our start

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,730
yeah i was a little bit insecure little
girl didn't have a whole lot of friends

45
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,390
that was a computer nerd and that wasn't
very popular for little girls back in

46
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,250
the into a tease but one of the things
that was kind of important to me was

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,250
this is really silly movie that was made

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,140
has anyone in this room even seen Space
Camp

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,929
aside from the fore front row ok alright
so I'm gonna try to explain this in the

50
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,720
best way i can space camp is a horrible
horrible movie especially cuz i

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,410
rewatched it and prepping for this talk
I probably haven't watched it for like

52
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,410
15 years at least it's awful

53
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm really sorry don't go watch it
unless you have some time to kill on a

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,710
plane then fine but the cute part about
this movie for me when i was a wee

55
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,710
little girl is that I wanted to be an
astronaut

56
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,290
that's what i wanted to grow up and be
but in watching this movie there's this

57
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:26,800
little kidney max max was the outcast
Max had no real friends he was the young

58
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,310
kid amongst a whole bunch of older
teenagers in this space camp that was in

59
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,120
huntsville alabama I kind of felt like
Max because I was always the young kid

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,290
you know I was a thirteen-year-old stop
the BS where I had people in their teens

61
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,430
twenties and thirties going in and I had
this power over them which is amazing

62
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,280
but I didn't exactly fit in and it
wasn't exactly socially acceptable for

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,169
me to hang out with like 20 year old
with a 13 different story different time

64
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:06,190
but when I was watching this movie max
becomes friends with this little robot

65
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,310
named jinx and that was this little
buddy

66
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,000
so the cute thing about is it really
resonated with me with my my computer

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,260
side we wanted to be an astronaut
standing up and trying to pretend to to

68
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,570
launch into space

69
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,889
this was like a pivotal movie for me
that being said as I grew up this lovely

70
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,840
gentleman also became slightly important
to my life he's a name is Oscar Wilde

71
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,289
and he wrote an amazing as a called the
decay of lying and in the decay of lying

72
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:47,919
he basically talks about how life
imitates art so it was a different

73
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,510
perception of how there are these
beautiful untrue things and that's

74
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,680
really what art is

75
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
it's about creating these beautiful
things that are fictitious they're

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,180
untrue but they give you the
believability so when we're talking

77
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,680
about this this entire keen on this talk
and what I want you guys to take away

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,490
from it

79
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:14,169
I'm gonna walk back to my little space
camp experience and go this little robot

80
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:21,460
jinkx try to help out his friend he
hacked into the NASA computers to try to

81
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,750
launch max into space because that's
what max wanted to do I wanted to go to

82
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,570
space so this this little robots hacking
into the computers and the robot was

83
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,770
adorable

84
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,750
because he's a lot like a lot of the
hackers a lot of us now where were

85
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,949
curious we're trying to do good even
though it might not be the good thing to

86
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:47,590
do so he didn't know any better and he
tried to help get maximum space in the

87
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,310
end of the movie he actually ends up
helping get max back completely horrible

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,430
story line

89
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,750
but what makes this important is that
date 1986 in the US was a very important

90
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,770
date for our our whole space program
this movie was done with production in

91
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:15,650
the beginning of $MONTH 1986 in January
28 1986 we had the first disaster in our

92
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,810
space program which was the Challenger
disaster this movie was released in june

93
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:28,160
already gone through production but what
actually happened in the movie but this

94
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
was completely written screen written
this is already done by the time this

95
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,359
accident happened they had a solid
rocket booster malfunction in the movie

96
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,100
that's actually what happened with the
Challenger when it exploded it was a

97
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,110
solid rocket booster problem so it
brings us to the whole it's interesting

98
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,340
how life imitates art even when it's
unintended so as we go through and have

99
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,039
a little bit of fun today the the TLDR
of this whole situation is we need to

100
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,570
work harder and faster to fight for the
users a lot of a skier over the next two

101
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,860
days are going to hear about exploits
about cool tools and things that we can

102
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,060
do a technology one of the things i want
to think about and I want everyone to

103
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,610
kind of unify with is understanding that
we all are employed we're all doing this

104
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,750
for the greater good of society and for
the users so how do we take this

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:29,270
information back and how do we help
fight for the users so along the lines

106
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,409
of fighting for the users and where this
hall comes from comes from a movie Tron

107
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:40,850
that was done in 1982 so tron is amazing
being as that was done in 1982 it has a

108
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,860
gentleman named Flynn who is this road
programmer who he worked for this big

109
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,610
company name income and he made lots of
games

110
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,640
long story short about him is that he
had a boss that basically stole all of

111
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,800
his games called them his own

112
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,449
and got him out of the system so that
way he could get promoted escalated all

113
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,830
this so the cute thing about one of the
programs that he brought was this

114
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,810
program named tron tron was actually a
security program this is 1982 this is a

115
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,199
security program that he wrote to be the
the checker of the checking the master

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,089
control program had no authority no
logging know any of this over it

117
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
tron is the one that was supposed to
make sure that everybody was doing what

118
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,320
they're supposed to do is mostly
autonomous security program in 1982 so

119
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,300
along those lines of my animation
there's a there's a quote from dr.

120
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,459
Walter Gibbs who in this movie was the
the older doctor who was the mentor type

121
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,279
person and he said you know when that be
grand computers and the program start

122
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:06,600
thinking in the people will stop again
1982 what I found amazing about this is

123
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,230
that just this year just a few weeks
back

124
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,979
that's a def con that's the at the darpa
grand security challenge that's exactly

125
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,380
what we just did a few weeks ago we just
had computers battling CTF against each

126
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:34,500
other kind of interesting so five words
that probably changed a lot of a lot of

127
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,050
our lives in different ways you know
shall we play a game as we're going

128
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,390
through these movies and and kind of fun
little things I found it really

129
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:53,490
interesting in my research that Matthew
Broderick who was the star of this movie

130
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,360
actually a he couldn't really type in
this movie was was done so any of the

131
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,050
scenes that you see where he's typing
this is war games when he's typing he

132
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,620
just was really kind of baking at his
best he could he did a really good job

133
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,449
but he faked it but there's a scene that
I thought was amazing that didn't catch

134
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:17,010
until I watched it like 450 time so he
finds out for for those who have never

135
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,740
seen war games he's trying to find this
gaming protovision this this game

136
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,899
companies Soyuz war dialing tries to
find this game company comes up with all

137
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,350
these games on this computer system that
he's not sure what it is takes it to his

138
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,300
buddy's his other computer buddies and
they're talking about how to get into

139
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,060
the system and Matthew Broderick
actually says I don't believe any system

140
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:49,349
is totally secure and I was like whoa
this is 1983 and whoever wrote that's

141
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,220
amazing because i will say that to this
day I'm sure everyone in this room will

142
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,029
say that to this day there really is no
secure system

143
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:03,689
aside from one that you unplug right
fair enough so Morgan's taught as a ton

144
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,959
if you really break it down i'm not
going to pick on every single part of

145
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,579
war games and i would love to pick on it
with you guys later on today but it

146
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:15,449
taught us the time about computers in a
time that a lot of us are a lot of

147
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,410
people watching the general consumers
had no idea what a computer could do

148
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,839
they taught us about war dialing about
dialing like every every number that a

149
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,069
system could come up with in certain
area codes i mean you could anyone ever

150
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:33,029
used for dollars knows that you can put
a lot of different parameters and small

151
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,600
scope large scope whatnot I two rings it
picks up fine if not it moves on you

152
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
know in fact in my

153
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,160
in my career only recently have we
stopped testing forward like a war

154
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,089
dialing test and still there's some
people that still requested but it's

155
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,950
it's so rare but this is now you know
2016 and we're just now stopping were

156
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:05,850
dialing you notice about security back
doors again 1983 pretty amazing stuff to

157
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,260
think about when the general population
didn't have computers but they weren't

158
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,450
exposed at best it was a dummy terminal
but what I find amazing about war games

159
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:23,940
is that more games actually changed US
policy on on computer system and fraud

160
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,300
and at the time Ronald Reagan was the
president the US and he actually watched

161
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,490
war games at Camp David and he started
asking questions and that's how this

162
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,340
policy started to come up I mean so a
movie actually influenced US policy in

163
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,010
1983 another kind of cool thing that
happened out of it which I thought was

164
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,420
hilarious

165
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,300
is anyone who's ever seen word games has
seen this amazing picture of NORAD it

166
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,459
has all these screams beautifulness at
the time when people are going and

167
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,630
touring your ad they were really kind of
set because they're like well where's

168
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,420
the computers where were the real
screens so it actually caused them to

169
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:18,390
upgrade their systems not once but twice
the more recent one was in 2003 so kind

170
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,189
of interesting another area where you
know movies kind of pushed our progress

171
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:31,500
the art push the life now I'm gonna pull
an obscure one out for you guys and even

172
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,060
in the most audiences won't even
understand this but i'm going to give

173
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,569
you a little quick interest with this is
this is another one of those horrible

174
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,690
movies from the 80s because clearly we
know what my lonely life was in the

175
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,570
eighties is a little kid but this was
Darryl which was data analyzing robot

176
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,060
you life-form is this really weird ET
extraterrestrial kind of kind of show

177
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,630
again this little computer have computer
half-human kid I'm only pulling this out

178
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,070
because i found this part i love this
when I was watching this is a kid I'm

179
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,930
like this is so-called this gadget makes
an ATM increase the the dads amount of

180
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,650
money that he has in his account kid was
doing ATM hacking in 1985 which there's

181
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,730
a talk later today about that as well
but i wanted to definitely say you know

182
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,270
from 1985 to 2010 when barnaby jack is
Jack padding of atms you know this is

183
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,410
again

184
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:41,280
life imitating art here by and far I
need to know

185
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,750
has anyone seen the movie sneakers ok we
have some ok thanks i'll explain this to

186
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,900
you like I explained this to my father
because this is the only movie that

187
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,230
allows me to explain what I do for a
living to my father and he still sits

188
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:03,030
and goes I don't get it he did he ask me
this a week ago to so sneakers is is

189
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,120
kind of a cool little movie that had
river phoenix in it which I'm really

190
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,310
upset that he's now passed away because
he was going to be my husband but it was

191
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:17,459
a movie about a security consulting firm
basically in 1992 it had these guys that

192
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,400
when broke into companies on behalf of
behalf of the company's so you have you

193
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,600
know dan Aykroyd at all these famous
American actors breaking into these

194
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,720
companies how the story starts out is it
has robert redford starting out with his

195
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,740
partner and they're doing basically
hacktivism the very first scenes of this

196
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,430
movie

197
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,349
they're taking money from bank accounts
and transform into charities so the very

198
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,650
early ideas of hacktivism were actually
introduced in the smoothie

199
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,590
there's a lot of other concepts that
were introduced but the most important

200
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,820
one that I felt you really see
especially in the scene is when they

201
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,770
realize how important cryptography is
this whole movie is based around

202
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:08,129
stealing back this this chip they can
decrypt everything this this master

203
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:17,580
algorithm so in the his former partner
is now working for organized crime and

204
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,579
they're trying to keep it away from the
government

205
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,970
this just happened not too long ago with
Apple where Apple's actually took us a

206
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,950
very firm stopped and said we're not
going to give a back door to governments

207
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,990
we are going to stand strong and shortly
after this this was you know just aware

208
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,390
of this year you know they just they
hired back some of the most amazing you

209
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,950
know crypto minds that there are out
there to again further secure their

210
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,340
platform and this isn't an apple add
this is just more

211
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:58,949
this is amazing that these people are
noting that this is important for good

212
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,520
measure

213
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,060
I have to add jurassic park so 1993 we
have to ask park which I thought was an

214
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:13,919
interesting time for computers IT
departments and this is nerdy and as

215
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,280
much as they got Dennis nerdy they got a
lot of it right they gave him a horrible

216
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,410
last name thank you very much

217
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,980
they gave him jolla which is what they
thought everybody drink which I think

218
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,760
everybody tried to drink what it was but
this to give us an important insight as

219
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,190
to how we're doing things right or wrong

220
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,680
this gentleman was the one man IT
department he was the only guy with the

221
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,000
keys the castle and around the time in
the movie where we get introduced to him

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,140
he's not feeling very valued now he is
going to stick it to to mr. Harmon and

223
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,800
steal the embryo eggs and run off the
island with them to give them to a

224
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,629
competitor because he's not feeling
super value so this is the way that a

225
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,560
lot of small and mid-sized companies
this is their world in the nineteen

226
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,780
nineties I'm I'm coming up through ite
back in those days people weren't

227
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,160
investing a lot of money

228
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,070
it's a very interesting time for us now
insecurity because I think we're

229
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,909
starting to feel those pains and
security where we are now changing from

230
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,880
one to five persons security shops for
midsize business and growing into a more

231
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:29,280
developed Department of more respected
field back in the 90 is pre y tu que you

232
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,920
know we were just the people that were
turning on the computers and making sure

233
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,240
that they did what they needed to do for
people we were the the nerdy people you

234
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,110
know with our glasses that walked up and
said move let me fix that for you

235
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:48,870
so as we know we have so much failure
when it comes to Jurassic Park we have

236
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,860
AB sec failure we have code review
failure we have separation of duties

237
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,439
failure i mean we could go on and on in
this movie but the most important value

238
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,050
i think that we have is we have insider
threat

239
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,280
this is where we really get introduced
to why insiders it's important to keep

240
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
people happy but to what degree

241
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:17,610
we have a 2008 incident in san francisco
where we had a network admin that went

242
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,809
rogue and tried to hold the city hostage
because he had the keys to the castle

243
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:27,928
again single points of failure it does
art necessarily is life imitating art

244
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:38,129
again the interesting side note this
gentleman Terry child's he is called a

245
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:43,350
network kidnapper the press had a great
time with him but as with a lot of

246
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,899
misunderstood computer crimes what you
read the article and see how many things

247
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:54,090
they try to pretend that he could do it
was amazing and also quite scary

248
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,039
this leads to me to our favorite one
again I'm gonna take an audience poll

249
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,809
again for those you awake anyone seen
the movie hackers few more people

250
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,019
because you're in this field if you're
in this field most people have at least

251
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:15,809
been exposed to what this movie is this
movie was done in 1995 one of the cool

252
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,289
things about this movie is one of the
writers of the movie actually went to a

253
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,850
2600 meeting in New York he actually met
real hackers he actually got a little

254
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,980
exposure so he actually had a few
consultants were hackers so as much as

255
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,480
they had to Hollywood this movie they
got a lot of things right and a lot of

256
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,990
things just terribly terribly wrong but
hackers the long story short of what the

257
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,309
hackers movie is for those of you that
haven't seen it it's a story about a

258
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:50,039
child hacker who basically got got in
trouble with the federal government

259
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,999
about a couldn't touch the computer for
years New York with his parents his mom

260
00:21:53,999 --> 00:22:00,090
gets involved with a little hacker
circle and ends up having one of the one

261
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:05,939
of the other kids hacks into a system
attacks the gibson and gets ahold of

262
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,769
these these treasure garbage files and
they end up going through this entire

263
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:14,759
movie which is trying to clear this this
guy's name because all hackers are

264
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,049
horrible people

265
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,668
so with that this is the movie that
started the idea for this talk

266
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:29,650
and it was more wrapped around this cute
little scene where you have the the

267
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,720
director of security and then his
security admin who happens to be pen

268
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,180
when the magicians in the US and they're
talking about different things they're

269
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,830
talking about how how God wouldn't be up
so late because of course they're see

270
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,740
CEO or CFO i believe it was that's what
their username was God because of course

271
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,480
then they go through part towards the
end of the movie where all the hackers

272
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,840
come together and are attacking the
system so they can get in and get the

273
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,730
evidence to clear the guys name and they
said something super interesting

274
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,520
he said you know this is the workload of
at least you know 7 users that was a

275
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,490
pivotal point for me that I went this is
funny in 1995 they're going they have no

276
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,600
system logging and sims in deployed they
can actually tell them the workload of

277
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,389
so many users at that point in time i
work with enterprise companies and

278
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:31,660
fortune fifties that don't have the
ability to pinpoint that much and this

279
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,330
is 2016 yeah we're not quite there yet
but it brings to light a few other

280
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,750
interesting you know concepts back in
1995 it teaches a little bit about DDoS

281
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,640
attacks it teaches us about access
controls goes through strong users and

282
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,210
passwords don't use God don't use love
don't use all those things that he likes

283
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,650
to to garble off but it also teaches you
about malicious insiders again we're

284
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,700
starting to see a reoccurrence of
certain themes the the gentleman the

285
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,200
director security created this virus in
this movie that is supposed to sink the

286
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,790
tankers if a certain amount of money
isn't transferred into his account so

287
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,510
one of the other things we learned about
in this movie and the more comedic part

288
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,610
is i would love to find a system that is
as graphical as this is I mean whenever

289
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,100
hacking is made to look sexy

290
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,780
that's the movie you think of we're
flying through things

291
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,780
not so much

292
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,310
so this is one of the more funny movies
that we came across

293
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,709
i'm not a huge italian job fan but there
was two makings of italian job of the

294
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,830
more recent one has Seth Rogen is the
computer hacker and it in his part he

295
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,659
supposed to be the gentleman who created
napster the real napster all this all

296
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,620
this information but when it comes to
the hacking in this movie

297
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,189
the cool thing about it is this is 2003
and he's talking about hacking the

298
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,830
traffic system in LA so they're trying
to follow these these trucks were only

299
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,570
one of the trucks has the money in it
he's gonna hack the traffic system so

300
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,600
that way the truck goes exactly where he
wants it to go

301
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
insider threat all this good stuff right

302
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:37,430
we actually had this happen in 2007
we're shortening the gap to where art

303
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,280
life imitating art only four years to
the real attack we actually had where

304
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,190
the engineers in la who kind of built
the system for the traffic control

305
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:55,520
systems they went on strike so the
logical thing that the management did to

306
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,990
them is they took and they shut off all
their user access so the management went

307
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,930
and shut off the user access to the
people that designed the program sure

308
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,050
shutting off one user name is going to
really do a good job

309
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,260
no they had about a million ways to get
if they needed to and they probably very

310
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:24,920
much regretted but they did get in they
did cause pain in LA

311
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,060
they did cause congestion they disrupted
the traffic system in LA to to make

312
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
their point so

313
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,629
that made me think after I told you guys
all of this but all these different

314
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,870
movies all these kind of cute little
things that we can derive from how life

315
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,530
is imitating art that made me sit and go

316
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:58,790
what if well a little bit about me is
that not only do i I like packing i like

317
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,310
technology i love what I do for a living
I have a really really bad addiction

318
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,800
that has cost me a lot of money over the
years

319
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:13,879
I'm admitting this to you so my
addiction is I really love cars I've

320
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,790
spent so much money on cars it's
ridiculous

321
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,690
I don't have a Ferrari but I was like
home there's a movie with somebody

322
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,460
stealing a Ferrari in it

323
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:30,950
what if so in Gone in sixty Seconds they
are about these these car thieves that

324
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,870
are ultimately doing these things
stealing cars again to try to to save

325
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,459
one gentleman's little brother from
gettin killed but for the point that I

326
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,170
took away from the movie is how cool the
technology they used in stealing these

327
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,300
cars was and for those of you that have
seen the movie hackers we were first

328
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,310
introduced to Angelina Jolie back and
hackers and so I often like to channel

329
00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:00,800
my inner animal angelina jolie this is
her from that movie and she is a pretty

330
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:09,710
amazing car thief for lack of better
word and I went hm if I was Angelina and

331
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,510
I needed to break into a warehouse with
some Ferraris what would i need to know

332
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:22,190
well the first thing I need to know is
how for them not to see my face so in

333
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:30,680
doing this I decided to take a look at
wireless CCTV cameras so in doing a

334
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,490
little bit of research and this is where
the movie stuff is amazing but this is

335
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:40,850
where what we do for a living becomes
not not as sexy but important i wouldn't

336
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,668
said okay what do I need to know about
camera systems

337
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,609
in order to break into my warehouse and
steal me a Ferrari so I need to know you

338
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:55,320
know what the offline time is that
camera i need to know if I bump it

339
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,369
offline

340
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:59,580
how long until it notifies you doesn't
notify you

341
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,239
I need to know if there's any cash video
if anything's on the onboard video is

342
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:07,830
going to store and when it comes back on
the network is again a dump now I need

343
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,649
to know any wired options i need to
understand and profile what I'm actually

344
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:17,340
getting into here because i'm only gonna
go after the warehouses with the

345
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,649
Ferraris and a wireless cameras because
wires a little bit more complicated i'm

346
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:25,859
also going to talk about the type of
power it has it batteries that wired

347
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,090
remember that we're going to talk about
that in two seconds and then any

348
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,209
additional information that it needs
anything it needs to function doesn't

349
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,259
need a base station

350
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,220
what does it need and just generally you
know what other performance observations

351
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,749
i can find so in a doing this little
experiment i decided to have a little

352
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:47,220
diversity in it

353
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,299
I didn't want to just test one kind of
camera one shape camera one color camera

354
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,080
i wanted to test as many cameras on the
market as I could find so I took about

355
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,330
ten cameras and I said okay let's let's
test each and every one of you

356
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,470
let's figure out if I'm gonna find a
warehouse with Ferraris that have a

357
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:14,429
camera i need to know which ones to go
after the longshore the test simple

358
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:20,429
normal methodology stopwatch starts at
zero one minute I start the target d off

359
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,690
i'm not getting a whole lot into the dr
i mean you can get Callie you can run

360
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,059
your own dls I can explain to you more
later but for the purpose of this i did

361
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,408
a targeted d off against the cameras ice
can form a contested target idiotic

362
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:38,460
against each individual camera 30
seconds or so i did a hand wave for

363
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,529
those that have the only wake up on
motion and then at about 11 minutes i

364
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:47,399
stopped the d off and give it another
five minutes to do a recovery to see

365
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,600
when it comes back online if it comes
back online anything of the above

366
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,460
so as we kind of talked in the beginning
about my my lonely childhood why didn't

367
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,230
talk to many people

368
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,390
well my my adult childhood has not
changed a whole lot because i spent like

369
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,740
two weeks just doing this stuff because
that's how much fun I get to have in my

370
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,760
spare time

371
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,590
so this is the sign up for an idea that
one have fun and reproduce a little

372
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,928
wireless camera attack so i used the one
ipad is the timer doesn't show very well

373
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:28,169
test camera another ipad with the with
the app on it to show the test camera on

374
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,140
a different networks that we're not
dealing the same network and causing

375
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,090
myself a lot of problems and obviously
good old Kali doing the dump

376
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,820
so of course i like to show my work I'm
not gonna show all my work but this is

377
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:49,350
my SuperDuper fast version the demo you
get to see who the work was shown you

378
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,439
see my hand going in if I let this play
for a little while you actually see

379
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,370
different times with different days with
this occurs on but i will not totally

380
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:06,479
bored with that let's go to one more
camera at least so that being said you

381
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,240
get the idea so now what do I do with
this data so one of the cool things that

382
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,630
i noticed and it's it's part of a tool
that I've been building is I i call it

383
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,950
the get off my lawn

384
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,460
so it's just a targeted d off tool and
what you can do with that is you can

385
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,470
actually put the the first six of any
mac address do a simple Google figure

386
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,330
out what not what the provider is who
makes the camera and so why is that

387
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,280
information important why do I care I
care because I'm taking my big pringles

388
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,090
van and doing some were driving like we
talked about way back in the first movie

389
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:48,510
so in doing the were driving you can
just simply find out who has what camera

390
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,379
so I'm gonna go around to every ferrari
warehouse that i know of and figure out

391
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,270
who has the cameras that I know how to
knock off the network some are really

392
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,559
nice

393
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,740
some actually give you a little stickers
that say you're on camera

394
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:10,439
so once i get all this lovely
information you go Aaron okay fine you

395
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,639
get in the warehouse

396
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:14,639
what about the cars are going to the
case of the cars

397
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:21,749
yeah no worries this guy has a covered
for me in 2015 he was nice enough to

398
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:26,909
figure out how to do the remote keyless
remote keyless system entry for the cars

399
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:35,190
it was very nice to him so that being
said I've now been able to go through

400
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:41,219
drive around my Ferrari warehouses find
the Ferrari dealership that has what the

401
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:51,269
cameras i need and go take my Ferrari
you all say at a 930 in the morning who

402
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:58,259
cares who cares about this i care about
the cameras because these cameras are

403
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,239
seeing their security cameras i have a
problem with that I am fine with you

404
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:06,479
calling a camera webcamera we're cool
like that

405
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,418
not when you're actually saying this
camera is providing you any level of

406
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:17,759
security so when we talk about the
security cameras five cameras were

407
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:22,679
tested i want to show you how many are
not being sold as a security camera

408
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,220
there we go we have to we have the
lovely dealing in the Balkan of the two

409
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,408
that aren't actually claiming to be
security cameras

410
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,369
I applaud them they say what they're
doing they're not claiming to protect

411
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,399
you from anything which is really
interesting because i have all the

412
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,629
cameras tested the bell can actually
tested pretty much the best even though

413
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:53,429
it only did clips of video to kind of go
back a little bit all these

414
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,060
so on the market almost every
marketplace around the world

415
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,530
the cute one is the kuna who i was
fortunate enough that the last time that

416
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,680
I talked about this one of the gentlemen
that works on the development team

417
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,270
actually came up and told me one of the
flaws that we identified as effect on

418
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:16,440
this gonna light which is the light on
the bottom it has these status lights so

419
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,390
picture this you're putting this light
out in front of your house it's calling

420
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,589
itself a security light but has little
status lights that actually tell you if

421
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,080
it's offline and not recording so as
soon as you do a dr attack on it it goes

422
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,660
offline funny thing about the dr attack
if you run it for 10 minutes in that

423
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,730
only kicks it offline it reboots the
whole freaking thing to factory that you

424
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:47,250
have to reset it up even better part
about this they know about this they

425
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,260
actually have it on the website and warn
you

426
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:55,020
ok security camera that reboots after 10
minutes of of no connectivity no

427
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,530
connectivity for 10 minutes where i live
in the world i get power outages not

428
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,830
frequently but frequently enough that I
don't want to reboot my entire have to

429
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,400
reset the system every freaking time
because I'm gonna forget about it i have

430
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,610
a microwave light that blinks all the
time in my house so when it comes to

431
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,750
other cameras and in kind of things that
are are going on some really cool ones

432
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,520
when i said earlier that we want to
remember about the battery who's using

433
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,070
batteries vs wire connections this
Little Neck here is adorable and so is

434
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:35,460
Lodgy because a cool cute thing about
those two is they're magnets so after I

435
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,160
do them and go into my Ferrari warehouse

436
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,009
I'm just gonna grab them put them in my
bag and take off with them I'm not have

437
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,640
to worry about putting them back online
because you know i think you're going to

438
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,609
notice the one you're Ferraris is gone
so you're not going to worry so much

439
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,500
about the cameras up

440
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:58,160
so the summary of of issues and I've
talked about a few few different things

441
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,300
hopefully you guys have a coffee and you
you're you're up and ready for the next

442
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,070
session of the day the most important
issue going back to fighting for the

443
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:12,680
users is that we're still not solving
the most basic problems we can watch in

444
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,779
cinema basic problems and basic exploits
being used against networks and against

445
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,980
humans we have some amazing talks today
and tomorrow

446
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,279
how do we help empower our consumers our
users because that's who are working for

447
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,750
whether it's our family or people that
are working organizations how how do we

448
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:39,170
help them so yeah and about that jolla
that wireless CCTV camera thing

449
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,090
yeah most of them can be blasted offline
and not see or know anything

450
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,320
almost every single one of them has a
threshold for network interruption in a

451
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,150
and so it's not very hard in fact i'm
going to pick on canary because it

452
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:58,250
really good sports canary if you bump it
offline and you keep bringing it back

453
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,810
online about every five minutes but just
for about 20 seconds it will never

454
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:09,140
notify you it was ever offline so good
and bad about just designed and being

455
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,779
able to adapt network interference so
how do we help we need to fight for the

456
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,370
users again let's go back let's take all
the information that we're learning over

457
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,100
the next two days let's think about how
we can apply it

458
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,000
let's get inspired inspired to do more
research i think a lot of you are

459
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,650
absolutely amazing and will be a lot of
the sessions because i find what you're

460
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,280
doing

461
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,530
intriguing and I think we all are trying
to help for the common good

462
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,740
the common goal so we can take this
message back i think it will be amazing

463
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:46,160
but one last item when it comes to
cinema in life imitating art this talk

464
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,049
wouldn't be complete unless I didn't
make a little hat tip to mr. robot the

465
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,480
TV show on USA that most you can stream
and download if you haven't and you are

466
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,190
into hacking and your information
security i highly suggest watching this

467
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,120
we have some really good security
consultants that are working on this

468
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,098
program

469
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:10,299
there's almost everything here is
accurate for the first time we're seeing

470
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:14,529
people getting things right and we're
not looking at it as being super sexy

471
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:21,009
we're looking at as being actual threats
and bring it to the public eye so so

472
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:22,359
definitely had tipped to them

473
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,529
can't wait to see what's up next and
that is all I have folks i hope you guys

474
