1
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,889
alright i know they told me to stay in
this little box but I want to walk among

2
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:16,460
you

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,060
how are you guys doing this morning are
you awake awake

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,570
alright I prove it stand up Huh up
everybody up not just the hack in the

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,980
Box crew who weirdly listen to me i
don't i don't understand why this

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,100
happens every year so okay I make you
get up because i have to be up and my

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,910
god I drank too much last night so if i
have to be up you have to be up for just

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,260
two minutes

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,129
so besides the jack-in-the-box crew have
seen me do this to the audience before

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,280
how many of you have been in the
security industry for some security

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,300
industry or computing industry for five
years or less ok so sit down those five

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,959
years or less it down ok 10 years or
less

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,430
sit down ok now we're seeing how old I
am still standing

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:14,060
15 years or less ok alright wait wait
where dwindling here so who is left

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,950
standing up

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,390
okay number one these are people you
need to buy drinks for because we've

17
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,329
been through a lot

18
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:31,610
ok yes you can all sit down at this
point so thank you so much for having me

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,829
again at jack in the box

20
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,899
you know the crew here we were talking
about it the other keynotes and I were

21
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,310
talking about how much this conference
you know takes care of you and the crew

22
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,430
takes care of you and today I'm actually
going to talk about essentially a

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,509
massive long-held social engineering
hack that probably started for me about

24
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:03,229
18 years ago my first Def Con was DEFCON
7 so yes you need to buy me all the

25
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,750
drinks because I'm very old and clearly
i need those drinks to live because you

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,800
know water isn't doing it for me but I
know for me I hacking has been a passion

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,720
for quite some time and you know my my
career started so long ago in this

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,250
industry that there weren't a lot of
ways to make money legitimately or

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,180
otherwise

30
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,079
actually because the early internet
didn't have the same dependence that the

31
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:35,420
current Internet has for us as a society
you know we didn't do any banking online

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,670
back when i was learning how to hack
right we didn't do a whole lot of things

33
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:48,290
that our society depended on
economically socially and politically

34
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,689
let's not even go there right now I'm so
depressed in the United States but the

35
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:57,620
point was if you knew how to hack a
computer back in the days that i learned

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,739
how to hack a computer there were things
that you could do with it that were

37
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,150
mostly curiosity bound and how many of
you saw errands talk yesterday morning a

38
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,870
chance

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,239
yeah so Aaron did this great see this is
who wakes up in the morning

40
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:19,819
this you guys are hardcore um but you
know uh in terms of hacking and what you

41
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:20,988
could do with it

42
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,489
Aaron did this great walkthrough you
know that was inspired by Hollywood and

43
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:31,010
essentially showing how life was
imitating art in terms of hacking but

44
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,899
way back there really wasn't that much
you could do commercially in order to

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,159
make money if you were a hacker
certainly the the movie wargames you

46
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,500
know which started the the Reagan
administration United States on this

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,590
path of criminalizing hacking because
they were afraid of our superpowers they

48
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,840
were afraid of what we could do

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,139
certainly that was was a big moment in
hacking history however it was a moment

50
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,129
in which our activities were
criminalized not celebrated not

51
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:09,379
understood and ways in which that we
might have been able to contribute to

52
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:16,009
the security of our society were
overlooked in in favor of fear and I see

53
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:22,009
this today in terms of legislation
original regulation that is being put in

54
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:28,009
place or is already in place in terms of
trying to deal with our superpowers what

55
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,080
they perceive the normal people in the
world perceived as magic of what we can

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,669
do so

57
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,130
one of the things that i noticed during
my first Def Con that they keep telling

58
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,570
me not to move across the space but
obviously I just I can't stand it i

59
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,230
really want to be with you so how many
of you had a computer when you were a

60
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,270
child right

61
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,020
ok so there's a generational issue here
too as well how many of you had an old

62
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,770
computer that could only do command line
when you were a child okay there we go

63
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:12,099
so the thing the thing about it is is a
if that's how you had to learn how to

64
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,650
use a computer and that's how you have
to learn how to use the internet there

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,299
were a lot of things that you had to do
manually that weren't set up for you and

66
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,600
so when we were learning how to do this
we essentially had to either learn very

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,890
quickly how these things worked or write
something ourselves that made the

68
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:39,340
computer do what we wanted to do in
order to get what we wanted a lot of us

69
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,900
got our start insecurity because we had
a younger brother or sister that we

70
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,530
simply wanted to keep out of our files
so that was our first you know attempt

71
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,650
at encryption others of us got into it
because we wanted to play a game that we

72
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,659
didn't have a license for and so
learning how to use a hex editor to

73
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:08,680
crack you know a game but eventually the
stakes became much higher for all of us

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,700
as our dependence as a society grew on
computing on the Internet itself and on

75
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,370
the ability of people like the folks in
this room to change the rules at any

76
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,280
given time of what was possible with a
computer with a network and at this

77
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,739
point in our in our technological growth
with anything at all that might have

78
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,860
code running on it and might be on the
internet they called the Internet of

79
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,420
Things I feel like that's going to be a
term that goes away very quickly because

80
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,000
that is going to just define the
internet just because every single thing

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,370
that you are that you could have that
you want to collect

82
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,190
data is going to be talking to every
other thing and when I look at all of

83
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,060
the inter connected devices our
dependence on it societally our

84
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,430
dependence on economically and the fact
of the matter is that our society even

85
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,030
if you want to opt out of this new
interconnected world

86
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,020
let's say you want to drive a car with
not a single micro chip in it for the

87
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,039
rest of your life

88
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,690
that's lovely but you will be sharing
the road with vehicles that have been

89
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,080
designed to drive themselves and so your
safety and and the safety of the people

90
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,530
that you care about will be somewhat
dependent on dear god the security of a

91
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,289
vehicle that may or may not have been
designed to be a computer as well and we

92
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,000
all know how fragile this ecosystem is
especially the old folks that you need

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,570
to buy drinks for we all very much yes

94
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,969
see he's he needs a drink right now you
just help them out but we understand the

95
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,700
fragility of this ecosystem and quite
frankly it frightens the heck out of me

96
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,050
that not only is our society dependent
on it now but there will be no aspect of

97
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,690
society where you can opt out anymore
and you cannot opt out of the internet

98
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:16,410
and you can opt out of security so the
the title of this talk is actually

99
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,479
hacking the Pentagon how many of you
heard about half the Pentagon ok

100
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,020
the crew and my friends in the front row
put your hands down and anyone left

101
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,789
ok all 12 to people who are not crew or
my friends in the front row have heard

102
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:37,708
back the Pentagon so just to give a
little bit of background I obviously i

103
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,239
was i was a tinker hacker for a very
long time in my life but at a certain

104
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,570
point in my career I decided that I
needed to do some hacking that was a

105
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,570
little bit higher level in terms of how
much i could affect the world I

106
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,440
certainly could find bugs and I
certainly could you know make my

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,520
penetration testing clients satisfied
because i was able to break into their

108
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,050
network or or do all that

109
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,859
stuff but i realized at a certain point
especially considering i was finding the

110
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,410
same types of bugs over and over again
that one it was getting boring too we

111
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,519
weren't getting better at security
necessarily and and three that i might

112
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,230
not be able to effect change and help
society as much as I wanted to

113
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,750
if I was essentially hacking one bag at
a time one client at a time so remember

114
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,440
I said that that my first Def Con was
DEFCON 7 now is in 1999 and we were all

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,100
kind of rolling up and waiting for the
y2k bug has anyone heard of the y2k ok

116
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,990
alright again besides the front row and
the crew who is left in the room

117
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,160
ok so we were concerned about this
glitch that was going to affect so many

118
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,920
computer systems worldwide and they have
a shortage of programmers who could

119
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,019
program you know in a lot of the the
languages cobol for example that that

120
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,800
we're running a lot of this vulnerable
code and we were worried that

121
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,180
essentially the grid as it were way back
then was just going to come crashing

122
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,599
down

123
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
you know we're worried airplanes are
gonna fall from the sky all kinds of

124
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,350
things

125
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,980
hardly any of that happened there were a
few little incidents that were related

126
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,339
to y2k but think about the computing and
interconnectivity that was around in

127
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,279
1999 vs where we are today in 2016 and
you begin to see this picture of that

128
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,660
was viewed as a potential disaster on
the horizon because of one bug

129
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,399
distributed across multiple systems
around the world you see the growth of

130
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,480
the internet and i would love to have
stats off the top of my head but let's

131
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,770
just say it's grown exponentially our
dependence on it has grown exponentially

132
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:54,540
today we have so many interconnected
devices with often no way to update them

133
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,829
it's not a matter of finding someone who
can write the code and correct the one

134
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,140
bug but you know I crew and front row
you're allowed to raise your hands for

135
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,880
this heartbleed anybody

136
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,220
yes you've heard of this ok so
heartbleed is such a great example of

137
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,899
where we are now in terms of our state
of overall vulnerability and inability

138
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,760
to deal with the

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,220
issues at hand shared library open
source bug in the code for more than two

140
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,800
years couple of people manage to
concurrently find that bug so proving

141
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,660
that you know if one person found it

142
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,870
probably somebody else did as well that
old theory or a bug collisions but think

143
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,590
about what the rollout looked like
you're dealing with that one

144
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,870
Varner ability coordination at best
between one hacker one finder and one

145
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,510
vendor is rough sometimes imagine
vulnerability coordination between

146
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,970
hackers vendors of an open source
library and then the fact that the

147
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:04,230
library itself has to be distributed
across the world that distribution and

148
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,300
that vulnerability coordination took
over a hundred different companies all

149
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,579
trying to keep a secret that ultimately
leaked about a week before the

150
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,200
designated date where everybody was
supposed to go live with it so thinking

151
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,300
about the problems with vulnerability
coordination even on a scale like that

152
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,109
where it's just trying to deploy fix for
one shared library and you look at the

153
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,810
world of internet of things and how many
of those things have full software

154
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:42,630
development houses in at their disposal
have full testing houses have automation

155
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,050
and testing have any kind of security
development lifecycle you pretty much

156
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:52,979
come down to almost no one and then of
those IOT vendors how many of the them

157
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,050
are using open-source libraries you come
up with most of them and it's a shortcut

158
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,599
way for a lot of these technology
organizations or these non technology

159
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,780
organizations who are suddenly adding
code to their to their devices and

160
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,459
systems to ramp up very quickly and
develop something that can suddenly talk

161
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,360
to the internet when they don't you even
know what they're doing and they have no

162
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,970
way to essentially service or patch all
of these devices so

163
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:32,680
let's get back to hacking the Pentagon
right so hacking the Pentagon 1 i'm

164
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,640
amazed that they kept that name hack the
Pentagon that was that was a surprise to

165
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,240
probably all of us who were working on
this project for the last couple years

166
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,990
we would call it that but what it was
was symbolically and effectively the

167
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,410
very first time that the United States
government one admitted that it needed

168
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,100
some help in terms of cybersecurity not
just saying no no we're secure

169
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,060
trust us it's fine all of your personal
data you know everyone who's ever

170
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,030
applied for a clearance it's fine where
we'll take care of it

171
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,270
one it was the first time they were
openly asking for help from the hacker

172
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,680
community to was the first time that
they wanted to do anything with the

173
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,489
hackers publicly except throw them in
jail and three

174
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,780
it was the first time that the United
States government was willing to pay

175
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,780
people like us for $MONEY in exchange
for vulnerabilities and you might think

176
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,250
that this was some kind of an impossible
task and it was for sure

177
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,340
definitely the people inside the
Pentagon who helped make this happen

178
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,010
who were the internal bureaucratic
hackers Lisa with wall

179
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,020
Charlie Chris Lynch all of those folks
and Secretary of Defense ash Carter

180
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,170
himself who made the decision ultimately
to go ahead and do this crazy thing and

181
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,579
prove the fact that not only could the
government work with hackers directly

182
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:01,090
but they could work with hackers and
invite them to hack the actual Pentagon

183
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:08,020
and survive and get better that program
lasted for about 21 days it was a pilot

184
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,199
program the Department of Defense's
publicly announced already they're going

185
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:20,020
to expand that program because what they
found was over 1,400 hackers tried to

186
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,730
pre-register for this program a lot of
people were thinking that this was not

187
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,530
going to work that that you know a lot
of my hacker friends actually are still

188
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,650
to this day very suspicious about the
whole thing thinking that they were

189
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,510
going to be registered in this giant
government

190
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,380
the base they were going to end up in
one time oh you know that essentially

191
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:46,810
all the paranoia was there and yet 1400
different hackers came forward and

192
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,910
wanted to participate in this historic
program and you know have all their

193
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,670
names written down in their social
security numbers known and all that

194
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,530
stuff but the fact of the matter was the
United States government wasn't just

195
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:04,930
looking for its bugs it was looking for
people who are willing to help people

196
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,400
who would actually answer the call when
they said we actually need your help

197
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:18,280
hackers we need your help so those 1400
within i believe it was 13 minutes after

198
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,750
the doors opened on hack the Pentagon
that the first vulnerability report was

199
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:29,560
received 1,400 people and already less
than 15 minutes into the program bug

200
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,030
started coming in so looking back at
what the Pentagon's goals were engage

201
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,650
the hacker community find out about
vulnerabilities in some of its websites

202
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:48,640
and figure out who is willing to come
forward and trust the fact that they

203
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,780
would actually come forward when called
to hack the Pentagon and they would

204
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,730
actually turn over the bugs they found
all of these things had to be met in

205
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,740
order for that program to be deemed a
success and deemed a way to move forward

206
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,990
in a new way with the hacker community
rather than putting them in jail for

207
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,810
threatening them but in fact embracing
them and I will not forget the fact that

208
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,730
at the end of the program Secretary of
Defense ash Carter invited a couple of

209
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,920
the hackers up to the Pentagon to stand
with him as he talked about the results

210
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,200
of the program one of them was a high
school kid and you know for those of us

211
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,990
who have been doing this for a very long
time can you imagine can you imagine as

212
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,660
we were children that the leader of one
of the most powerful or potentially the

213
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,120
most powerful military organization the
world has ever seen is thanking you for

214
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,000
pointing out his weaknesses

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,510
amazing this was incredible

216
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,860
so how did this even come to be the
first time I went to the Pentagon I was

217
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,240
still working at Microsoft

218
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,710
so for those of you who know how long
ago I worked at Microsoft i left in

219
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,140
$MONTH 2014 i started Microsoft's bug
bounties and 2013 that process itself

220
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,180
took me about three years to get
microsoft to agree to pay hackers money

221
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,850
but what had happened in order to lead
up to the Pentagon and this historic

222
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,929
moment where you know the leader of the
most powerful military in the world is

223
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:33,480
thanking a child for pointing out his
weaknesses began when I had actually

224
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,860
briefed some of the folks inside of a
small group at MIT and harvard on what I

225
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:47,520
had done to convince microsoft to allow
hackers to hack them and get paid for it

226
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,889
now does anybody remember it was this
back in like two thousand eight or so

227
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,670
does anyone remember what Microsoft
would say when they were asked about

228
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,820
whether or not they would pay a bug
bounty or pay hackers money in or

229
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,040
exchange for abilities anyone remember

230
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,960
ok no one remembers that's okay
microsoft was publicly saying that they

231
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,880
would never pay for vulnerabilities they
said that word they said never you know

232
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,080
most mega-corporations usually we'll
head around what they say and they don't

233
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,250
use absolute that they can't if they can
avoid it and Microsoft was using an

234
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
absolute saying never

235
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,580
and why was that in the microsoft
security response center

236
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,000
how many of you saw sweeties talk
yesterday didn't you be so sweetie

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,590
sweetie stop sweeties talk was i missed
it but I saw the slides the slides

238
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,490
looked great it's talking about all the
mitigation enhancements to the windows

239
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,750
10 platform and all the ways in which
exploitation techniques are becoming

240
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,240
harder to execute even if you do find a
critical vulnerability on the platform

241
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,480
but going back to $MONTH 2008 microsoft
executives were saying they were

242
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,980
swearing that they would never pay money
and what was going on what was causing

243
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,070
them to believe that they would never
have to do that when the microphone

244
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,250
Security Response Center they were
receiving over 200,000 non-spam email

245
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:15,360
messages per year of friendly hackers
who were volunteering for free to tell

246
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,709
microsoft about its weaknesses so with
that data they were thinking well you

247
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,550
know all these friendly hackers who want
to see the world being a safer place

248
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,240
these friendly hackers are willing to
come forward for free

249
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,810
rule number one always silence your own
phone when you're presenting okay there

250
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,440
we go

251
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,750
um actually the day I announce the
microsoft bug bounty programs I was

252
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:42,720
onstage in bangkok and I heard a phone
ring going off and it was going off and

253
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,180
I was thinking wow somebody really needs
to silence that thing and then I

254
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,410
realized it was a windows phone ringing
and I realized the only person who whose

255
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,330
phone it could possibly be was mine so i
had to go well okay there was maybe one

256
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,050
other person in the room whose phone it
could possibly be but I essentially my

257
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:03,210
own alarm was going off on stage the day
that I was announcing the microsoft bug

258
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,980
bounty programs and actually dylan and
Belinda were there with me was an

259
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:15,060
amazing day but so how do i get
microsoft from this position where they

260
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,190
were receiving so many bugs for free

261
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,140
where they were receiving tons of
critical and critical vulnerabilities

262
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,160
for free even when there was a you know
a an exploit a vulnerability market that

263
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,690
was alive and well we're all these bugs
were getting bought by other parties

264
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,590
whether they were defensive parties like
the zero day initiative how many of you

265
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,540
have heard of zdi okay great so zero day
initiative and other kinds of

266
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,310
vulnerability acquisition programs like
it are defense-oriented in that they

267
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,300
will buy the vulnerability in order to
get it fixed they will buy it they will

268
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,149
give it to the vendor to fix it they
will maybe build a product or an

269
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,450
alerting service or something around the
fact that they've acquired these unknown

270
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,740
Milner abilities but that's the defense
market for vulnerabilities the office

271
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,830
market for vulnerabilities is something
entirely different

272
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,330
the office market is buying
vulnerabilities and exploits in order to

273
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,659
keep them secret in order to use them
for attacks in order to keep them live

274
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,760
and and you know viable for as long as
possible so they're not just buying the

275
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,440
vulnerability they're actually buying
exclusivity how do you heard what

276
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,550
happened with hacking team any of you
heard of hacking team okay great so

277
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:36,090
hacking team was a great example of how
the office market really worked you saw

278
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,919
in the email dumps of hacking team that
vulnerability or exploit sellers were

279
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,870
offering a range of vulnerabilities and
they were offering a priceless price

280
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:51,090
plate breaks if you bought a bundle you
know bargain bargain bugs and they were

281
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,360
also offering exclusivity of the
vulnerability itself by tripling the

282
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,790
price they also had a payout schedule
that was very nicely documented saying

283
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,639
you know if you buy this bug give me
fifty percent of the money upfront and

284
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,740
then pay me out twenty-five percent
20-percent one month later and then the

285
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,210
last month later and you don't have to
pay if the bug essentially gets patched

286
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,770
or or something else happens to make it
less viable for attack

287
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,790
so you begin to see the the reason why
some of the the prices for

288
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,190
vulnerabilities seem so high in the
office market versus the defense market

289
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,600
is because again they're not paying just
for the vulnerability they're paying for

290
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,580
the hackers silence they're paying for
the ability to use this thing for office

291
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,020
for as long as possible so let's get
back to Microsoft right so Microsoft's

292
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,810
getting all of these bugs for free

293
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:58,740
sounds great sounds like a reason to
vows never to pay hackers money however

294
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,590
there was this pesky thing that I had
access to which was vulnerability

295
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,699
reporting data inside of Microsoft and
one of the things that was very

296
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,380
important to Microsoft was that it had
not just this pipeline of free bugs but

297
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,230
it had a pipeline of potential recruits
of hackers who it might be able to hire

298
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,820
to help make its products more secure
this direct interaction with hackers

299
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,149
potentially for recruiting was very
important

300
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:35,370
to the biggest software company in the
world famously let's see there was a

301
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:41,280
hacking group in Poland that some of the
early folks at microsoft security years

302
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,530
before i was over there went to go visit
because they had found some serious

303
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,940
vulnerabilities they want to go visit
them to recruit them some of those folks

304
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,560
still work at Microsoft to this day 15
years later trying to help make those

305
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:03,060
products more secure so the data that i
had was showing that not only yes the

306
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,040
bugs were still coming in but more and
more of the bugs the critical bugs in

307
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,870
critical software like internet explorer
we're coming in through zero day

308
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,550
initiative or other defense market
brokers so what did that actually do it

309
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,340
cut off access that microsoft had
directly to the hackers this is bad

310
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,000
it also did something that Microsoft
didn't like which was put a time limit

311
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,180
on effects and I hate that so they were
too kind of undesirable things were

312
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,150
happening even though they were getting
the bugs even though somebody else was

313
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,750
paying for them and even though you know
generally speaking at least a hundred

314
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,110
eighty days would pass before anybody
drop the ODA in this in this little

315
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,850
defensive ecosystem they realize that
they wanted to actually change those

316
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:53,159
trends to regain direct access to that
hacker community that's capable of

317
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,930
finding those bugs to be able to control
you know essentially the timeline

318
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,670
because of who might know about the
vulnerability and the one piece of data

319
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:12,270
that I showed the IE team that ended up
knocking over the last of the objections

320
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:20,310
of Microsoft was data so ye would go
through a public beta period where they

321
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,510
would release you know and a less than
stable version of the software in order

322
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,990
for the class of the the customers to go
ahead and test it in their environments

323
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,640
Microsoft engineers were fixing as many
bugs as they could

324
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,140
during this beta . so what was happening
with all these free you know free bugs

325
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,620
that the hackers were giving microsoft
how many of them do you think we're

326
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,959
coming in during the beta . one thing 40
50 now right actually very few so there

327
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,290
was usually very few vulnerabilities
coming in and then when they come in

328
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,990
there was a giant spike after the final
release of ie the release to

329
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,060
manufacturing so after rtm huge spike of
incoming vulnerabilities

330
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,630
what did that mean well the incentives
at that time for these hackers to come

331
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,580
forward with free bugs that microsoft is
offering was 10 . arial font and their

332
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,399
name in a bulletin so that was the only
incentive than a hacker had now if a bug

333
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,210
is fixed during the beta . chances are
unless it also affected downloadable

334
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,590
versions you weren't going to get your
name in the bulletin so hackers had

335
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:34,230
inadvertently been trained by Microsoft
to hold onto their bugs until the worst

336
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,060
possible time to tell Microsoft which is
after you're out of the beta . so i

337
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,500
showed the head of IE this big spike at
the worst possible time for engineering

338
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,740
for him and I said look all we need to
do is provide an incentive for these

339
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,990
hackers who are going to help us anyway
to come forward earlier in the beta .

340
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:58,530
and we can do this traffic shaping
exercise and we can move this spike

341
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,520
vulnerabilities and give you guys the
maximum amount of time to fix it

342
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,920
I didn't get through my little 12 slide
presentation to the head of IE i got to

343
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,400
slide to and he literally said to me

344
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,080
yes yes yes I'm gonna make it easy for
you how much was literally what he said

345
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,820
and I SAT there after a two-and-a-half
years about 12 and a half almost three

346
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,780
years I SAT there saying wait a minute
did that just happen did he just did he

347
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,060
just offered a back a truck of money up
to the microsoft security response and

348
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:37,590
pay for his bugs and in fact that is
what happened because just because he

349
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,939
wanted to align what the he knew the
hacker community was going to do anyway

350
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,410
which is look for bugs

351
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:47,190
he wanted to align what he knew the
friendly hackers were going to do anyway

352
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,850
which is turned them over to Microsoft
to get them fixed you wanted to align

353
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,750
all of these activities that were never

354
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,720
with his schedule and he was willing to
pay for it so that was that and that

355
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,540
finally ended Microsoft's long-standing
aversion to paying hackers money

356
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,840
directly for vulnerabilities finally
there was a reason to channel the

357
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,280
hackers eyes channel their energy and
point them at the product they wanted to

358
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,149
find out about which is the latest
product at the time they wanted to find

359
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,240
out about those bugs in the most
advantageous way for engineering and

360
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,580
then ultimately for the customer which
was the earliest part of the beta period

361
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,970
of that product so something else that I
was able to start at that time was not

362
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,420
just an individual bug bounty that was
time-based deliberately and and

363
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,420
orchestrated to move that big spike of
traffic

364
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,180
how many of you have heard of the
mitigation bypass bounty at Microsoft's

365
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,990
the $100,000 bounty that's been going
for the last three years

366
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:59,710
yeah so at the time you could go to poem
to own and that year you could get a

367
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,510
hundred thousand dollars was the top
prize opponent on that year for you know

368
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:08,440
coming up with an exploit that would
bypass all of the you know all of the

369
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,990
mitigations of any given platform target
you get a hundred thousand dollars if

370
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,490
you did the live exploits at that you
know at that moment during the contest

371
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,440
what i was able to convince microsoft to
do was not have a contest once a year

372
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,630
but essentially having an ongoing
six-figure bounty that wasn't

373
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,760
necessarily for a single exploit but it
was for something more valuable to

374
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,720
microsoft and that was for a mitigation
bypass technique

375
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,410
how many of you have heard a return
oriented programming ok how many heard

376
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,900
of jet spray right slightly fewer but
it's okay these are all representative

377
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,060
examples of mitigation bypass techniques
so whether you find a vulnerability and

378
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,940
whether you're able to exploit it are
two very different things right

379
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,510
especially as modern platforms have been
made more and more secure

380
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,140
so why would an organization like
Microsoft want to learn about mitigation

381
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,570
bypass techniques as early as possible

382
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,919
does anyone have a guess that's okay
well guess you know what will guess at

383
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,750
karaoke later it'll be more fun

384
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,710
uh-huh you know that's happening tonight
I'm just inviting you all at this moment

385
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,080
so the reason Microsoft needed to know
about it is early as possible is because

386
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,570
to create new mitigations to combat
those exploitation techniques takes not

387
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,350
just a patch tuesday it takes three
architects of the platform on some level

388
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,179
and that is something that usually takes
an operating system company several

389
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,900
iterations to change and it's not
because they're slow and they don't know

390
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,290
how to fix it is because all the
applications that run on top of the

391
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,750
platform all have to have time to adapt
to the new way that the operating system

392
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:55,650
works so it's essentially an issue of
future thinking engineering to make

393
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,030
exploitation harder because of what
you've learned about today of how

394
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,800
exploitation works on the platform today
these are much longer term fixes and

395
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,250
Microsoft essentially needed to know
about these new techniques as early as

396
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,660
possible to plan how they were going to
deal with it for the next version or

397
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:18,840
maybe even the version after that of the
operating system now remember I was

398
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,909
talking about those those different
markets and how you know they often will

399
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,250
pay for exclusivity and very high prices

400
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:32,190
how do you think that Microsoft was
competing directly on price with these

401
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,720
markets and we really think that great
so you don't think that or you've fallen

402
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,800
asleep

403
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,480
perhaps I need to run around you a few
more times ok but the fact of the matter

404
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,920
is they didn't need to compete directly
on price not for those IE

405
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,930
vulnerabilities that were critical

406
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:54,240
by the way how many of vulnerabilities
do you think were collected in that one

407
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:00,330
month bug bounty . at the beginning of
the ie11 beta release you want to guess

408
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,280
for a for ya

409
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,660
ok how much money do you think Microsoft
would have had to pay to get those four

410
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,590
maybe critical vulnerabilities

411
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,459
1 million dollars no I didn't hear that
out there

412
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,380
ok no actually what happened was even
though each of those vulnerabilities

413
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,539
there were 18 by the way vulnerabilities
that came in that were valid and what we

414
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,210
would call bulletin class they were
important or critical vulnerabilities 18

415
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:41,000
of them came in one month about 28,000
dollars total was spent to collect those

416
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,470
18 vulnerabilities

417
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,250
now why do you think you know it was
possible for Microsoft to get these for

418
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,870
such a low price

419
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,760
well think about those other markets
when the office market wants to buy a

420
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,399
bug they want to be able to use it for
attacks

421
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,750
why would they buy a bug during the beta
period of software why would they spend

422
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,220
six figures on an exploitable
vulnerabilities that may evaporate in

423
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,929
next week's you know test a new release
of the the beta software so they

424
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:13,310
wouldn't so essentially there's a gap in
the market they're now going back to the

425
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,509
hundred-thousand-dollar mitigation
bypass bounty

426
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,419
yes there was that same price for the
Pantone contest that year but remember

427
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,020
that was just offering a hundred
thousand dollars for working exploit it

428
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,710
could use one of those existing
exploitation techniques like return

429
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,609
oriented programming or just spray or
whatever it was didn't need to come up

430
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:38,449
with a brand-new technique in order to
claim that hundred thousand dollars in

431
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:44,418
that once a year contest so what was
microsoft thinking you know in terms of

432
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,540
will they have anybody who's willing to
come forward with this very very

433
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,119
valuable technique again think about who
the adversary is and what their goals

434
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,410
are the adversaries goals are to buy
these things that will work for as long

435
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,819
as possible but do they need it to
leverage of brand-new exploitation

436
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,119
technique in order for it to be
effective or worthwhile for them now

437
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,750
because the existing exploitation
techniques were working working just

438
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,609
fine so they didn't need to make that
additional investment in trying to find

439
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,509
these new exploitation techniques the
only party that was going to benefit

440
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,430
from acquiring these two new techniques
was going to be the operating system

441
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,020
manufacturer itself

442
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,340
hence

443
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,890
how i was able to convince microsoft and
not just by its own bugs in terms of ye

444
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:38,960
but by these new exploitation techniques
at what was until apples bug bounty the

445
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,910
highest ongoing vendor bug bounty or
vendor technique bounty essentially that

446
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,580
had been an unbroken record for the last
three years hundred thousand dollars on

447
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,819
going with no time limit and no end

448
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,460
anyone want to guess what the rate of
Microsoft's learning about new

449
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,750
exploitation was how often would they
would they come across a new

450
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,640
exploitation technique through other
means either disclosure you know from

451
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,049
research or you know from attacks in the
wild

452
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:20,330
anyone want to guess how often that
would happen before that bounty no one

453
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,580
wants to guess I'm gonna have to run
among you again

454
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,590
ok but actually it was about once every
three years and that corresponds with

455
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,700
the release of you know the operating
systems at that point right the new

456
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,069
mitigations come out some security
researchers and or some attackers would

457
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,850
research the ways that that Microsoft
tried too hard in the platform and make

458
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,470
exploitation harder and then you would
you would become aware of new

459
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,899
exploitation techniques once every three
years

460
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,180
does anyone want to guess at how many
times the hundred-thousand-dollar

461
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,560
mitigation bypass bounty has been paid
out in the last three years

462
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:08,600
well it's not once they paid out over
half-a-million dollars in this ongoing

463
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,690
County because the hackers who are
capable of thinking their way around the

464
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,840
latest mitigations often weren't doing
it for the money necessarily they might

465
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,310
be doing it for the recognition but they
were definitely doing it for what i call

466
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:30,830
the pursuit of intellectual happiness
and they were curious to see if they

467
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,819
could defeat these medications and
Microsoft was inviting them to go ahead

468
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,510
and do so and offering them six-figure a
man

469
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:43,970
aunt and all the publicity they could
possibly stand for being helpful in this

470
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:51,620
ecosystem so fast forward how did this
actually factor in to the Pentagon so I

471
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,029
had given a lecture about all of these
different mechanisms that I was

472
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:03,230
employing at Microsoft in order to
intentionally disrupt some of the

473
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,450
dynamics in the vulnerability to exploit
market and intentionally bring in some

474
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,790
of these bugs at certain times some of
these techniques at a faster rate and

475
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,140
all of these things and i had given this
lecture and somebody from the Pentagon

476
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,799
happened to be in the room that was the
first time i was invited to the Pentagon

477
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,260
so i gave the same lecture essentially
to a room full of people in the Pentagon

478
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:34,460
and one of the things that I noted was
you know as with any military

479
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,240
organization in the modern world there's
certainly where people who were in that

480
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,680
room who were interested in what I was
doing because they were annoyed because

481
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,190
it was going to make their offensive job
harder I don't know who they were i

482
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:56,060
couldn't identify them but the offensive
arm of you know the biggest military in

483
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:02,870
the world was in that room but the
defense arm was too and so the

484
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:08,930
conversations that were started at that
point became conversations I was having

485
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,890
over the next couple of years even as I
left microsoft even as I went to my

486
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,290
former startup company that does bug
bounties the conversations accelerated

487
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:26,180
this past fall and the reason they did
was because something called the digital

488
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,819
defense service was started inside the
pentagon now if you go into the Pentagon

489
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,210
and you find dds well or someone leads
you there they actually have a little

490
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:44,120
plaque under the door that says Rebel
Alliance star wars style right so you go

491
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,680
in and they basically say welcome to the
Rebel Alliance they've got you know

492
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,879
little bb-8 you know logos sides

493
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,099
it's an open seating environment and
they've got hackers and programmers from

494
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:03,819
some of the most interesting technology
companies who are doing rotations in

495
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:09,038
this place in the whole purpose is to
accelerate the Department of Defense's

496
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,299
acquisition and utilization of modern
technology and modern security

497
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:20,200
techniques so this brand new group that
had been created for the purpose of

498
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,569
accelerating uh you know dr accelerating
the Pentagon's adoption of Technology

499
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:33,519
much faster than the usual acquisition
acquisition time cycles of software that

500
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:39,758
was the group that ended up spearheading
on the inside the creation of hacked the

501
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:46,210
Pentagon because essentially they were
told do things better do things faster

502
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,279
and I believe in my purse is the card of
Lisa was well that literally says under

503
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:54,849
her title and this is an officially
issued card from the Pentagon get shit

504
00:40:54,849 --> 00:41:00,670
done it says it on her card so how cool
is that they were they were given a

505
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:07,150
license to try and experiment with
technology and try an experiment with

506
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:11,380
some of these proven techniques that
were in the software security world for

507
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,910
acquiring vulnerability information and
interacting with the hacker community so

508
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:22,210
the time was right they were ready to
essentially launch you know their launch

509
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,579
their rebel their her rebel mission and
I remember getting the call from the

510
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:33,759
Pentagon saying good news we're going to
go forward with this and I thought this

511
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:37,809
is insane why is this happening am I
dreaming I'm asleep what time zone mi ni

512
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:41,650
have no idea how could this even be true
that after all this

513
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:47,950
they're finally ready to allow hackers
to have them and so how many of you

514
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,089
actually want you know kind of saw the
the unfolding of of the actual hack the

515
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:58,480
Pentagon challenge the 21 days and
everything couple of you yeah so what

516
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,430
that ended up being was it was a pilot
right to prove the concept to oil the

517
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,058
gears of the people receiving the
vulnerability reports and and needing to

518
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:13,299
fix the issues on the back end of the
Pentagon 21-day period and they not only

519
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,750
got all of these vulnerabilities i
believe was a hundred thirty-eight

520
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:21,279
vulnerabilities that they paid 70
thousand dollars for total but they also

521
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:29,140
got that precious access directly to the
hackers and ash Carter inviting that

522
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,348
child to come stand beside him at the
podium to shake his hand in the secret

523
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:41,380
coin passing ceremony of of how they
give you challenge coins you know in the

524
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,589
military is supposed to be silent in
person and with a handshake

525
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:50,079
so if you watch that video you can see
ash Carter kind of getting the coins and

526
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,339
shaking the hands of the people who are
on stage with him including this child

527
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:57,759
at the end of it

528
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:03,009
not only did secretary carter announced
how successful the program was but he

529
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:10,269
announced that it was going to continue
and expand this experiment that 35 years

530
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:15,250
ago when the movie wargames you know was
coming out and scaring President Reagan

531
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,400
into making hacking a federal crime

532
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:27,369
from that moment all the way until
secretary Carter is thanking hackers and

533
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,369
asking more of them to come forward and
help

534
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:38,950
seems like an impossible thing but given
the fact that a long time ago when I was

535
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:44,410
hacking computers that moment where I
decided that changing the world one bag

536
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:51,700
at a time wasn't going to be enough
figuring out how these systems worked

537
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:58,750
how how the objections of these large
organizations worked became my new

538
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,559
hacking mission and essentially that was
what ultimately caused not just

539
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,710
microsoft not just the Pentagon but
we're seeing more and more of this rebel

540
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:15,480
ocean where huge organizations and
governments are realizing not just the

541
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,820
need to work with hackers but that that
it's actually quite advantageous to them

542
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:26,160
to do so and that they can't possibly
meet the challenges of today or tomorrow

543
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,569
without us so they restarted my time
like five times what I'm going to do at

544
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:39,000
this moment is give you about I think
maybe two minutes to ask me some

545
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,890
questions if you're shy

546
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,348
we can take the questions out into the
the Fourier but really I mean what is

547
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:47,400
this about

548
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,020
I told you about how I was able to
reverse-engineer you know all of the

549
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:57,330
objections of these large organizations
and in fact exploit the mutual benefit

550
00:44:57,330 --> 00:45:02,460
of being able to work with hackers
directly and in fact pay the money but

551
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,859
what does this have to do with you

552
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:08,069
how many of you are in organizations
that are considering a bug bounty

553
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:08,730
program

554
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,670
none you will not admit it ok how many
of you are in organizations that are

555
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,480
capable of receiving a bug report from
the outside

556
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:25,830
God so few so one thing was interesting
so I mean just for people who you know

557
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:30,089
will watch this later there were about
five hands that one up in this room that

558
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:34,680
does not surprise me one of the most
interesting pieces of data from my

559
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,180
former company was they looked at the
Forbes top two thousand companies these

560
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,560
are companies that make billions of
dollars in revenue they spend millions

561
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,589
of dollars on security they do all their
compliance stuff

562
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:53,010
ninety-four percent of the top two
thousand companies according to forbes

563
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,010
ninety-four percent had no published way
to receive a vulnerability report they

564
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,550
had no email address like secure at
Microsoft they had no web form they had

565
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:08,130
no page that on their website that even
said we want to hear from you hackers

566
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:15,089
tell us about our weaknesses ninety-four
percent only six percent had something

567
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:21,900
at all of the fortune 100 companies six
of them have bug bounty programs

568
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,060
so what does this all mean

569
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,470
this means that the world is not quite
ready for bug bounty programs because

570
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:37,700
the world is not quite ready to even
hear from you so what I would say to

571
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:44,450
that before i actually let you ask me
questions is think about all of the ways

572
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:49,730
in which an organization actually needs
to prepare to receive the bountiful

573
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:55,940
blessings from the hacker community
which are bugs and help them understand

574
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,540
that essentially there are only three
ways to learn about your vulnerabilities

575
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,830
you can hire pen testers or higher
really smart people to work for you and

576
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,690
find them yourself somebody friendly on
the outside like a partner or a customer

577
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:14,060
or a hacker can tell you about it or you
can be attacked now of those three

578
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:23,330
methods logically why would you ever
want to cut off one of them so with that

579
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,740
I would like to thank Dylan Belinda the
hack in the Box crew i would like to

580
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,020
thank all of you for waking up and
standing up and and entertaining me at

581
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,240
least for the last hour or so and i
would also like to open it up for

582
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,990
questions but at the end of the day I
mean we are the ones who have created

583
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:49,640
this technological world that we depend
on and we're the only ones who can

584
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,640
secure it so thank you so much

585
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,780
questions from the floor

586
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,780
don't be shy

587
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,440
I'm not singing yet ok that's not a
question you can ask but i will take

588
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,800
requests later

589
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:20,940
so what time is karaoke great question
what time is karaoke after whatever the

590
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,980
party is tonight there will be karaoke

591
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,720
no I mean in all seriousness I know you
may be shy and you might have but nobody

592
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,259
wanted to raise their hand when I asked
you know how many of your organization's

593
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,380
are thinking about but Manny's and then
how many of your organization's can even

594
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,890
receive bugs you probably have a lot of
shy questions you want to ask me in the

595
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:44,339
hallway and that's okay i'm pretty easy
to find on the internet but i want to

596
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,090
thank again the crew and all of you for
waking up and being with me and

597
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,990
indulging me this morning and now
remember who were those folks stand up

598
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:56,759
one more time the last group of people
who have been doing computers security

599
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,670
for the last 15 years or more

600
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,260
that last group of people stand up again
come on i know i'm i'm standing alright

601
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:10,560
these folks give them a hand because and
buy them drinks because my god we've had

602
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,340
so many reasons to drink ourselves to
death in the last 15 or so years

603
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:21,210
please buy them by the water as well
