1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,670
super

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,220
so my name is Fabian or fobs and when
Katie was doing her stand up sit down

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,948
15-year thing I'm right after the cutoff
I've been hacking for 14 years so I'm

4
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:35,130
not quite old enough to get a drink but
uh huh ok I'm harbor hacker reverse

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,399
engineer and now a singing keynoter so
be easy on me

6
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,030
this is not my day job or anything like
that but I thought it would be fun i've

7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,170
given the same keynote about not this
keynote but the same keynote five times

8
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,280
already this year and I thought well
I've got to do something new so why not

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,699
do something completely new and sing to
all of you

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,270
the first song we're gonna sing is about
passwords which a lot of you already I'm

11
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,789
going to be preaching to the choir a
little bit on this one but this is this

12
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,360
is for you to tell your friends who
aren't actors this is for you to tell

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,820
your friends who aren't in computer
security and yeah maybe you'll learn a

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
little bit about something

15
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:34,880
yeah

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,340
something about

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,119
there's a little bit too much feedback
sorry we do a little soundcheck quick

18
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:57,679
thank you and I have someone advancing
my slides if you're wondering how

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
they're magically advancing without me
touching them

20
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,460
so thank you

21
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,290
something so bad about that frame horse
batteries

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,990
little keys

23
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,850
yeah

24
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,840
rainbow dictionary attacks

25
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,890
all your passwords will be

26
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,490
by someone who

27
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,490
very serious generate

28
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,910
so generate your passwords

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,800
generate your

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
consistently

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,520
hope that you save me

32
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,980
never use them twice

33
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,510
that's my only advice

34
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,150
come on

35
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,330
you

36
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,940
you

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,940
you think

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,310
never in the cloud

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,310
you really think you're in control

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,740
generate you

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,080
generate

42
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:52,140
my experience taught me that when you
clone on newbie

43
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,109
yeah

44
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,110
from the entropy

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:06,990
and that's really bad so don't generate
don't generate your password

46
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,810
do you create new entropy have to do it
with can

47
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:19,988
then generate your

48
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,259
generate password generator

49
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,700
generate those

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,688
yeah

51
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,689
generate

52
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,330
generate

53
00:04:43,330 --> 00:05:02,198
consistently I couldn't just make it
easy on myself and do some PowerPoint

54
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,080
slides that would be too easy i had to
request the piano so I want to give a

55
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,240
special shout-out to the entire crew at
hippie g-sec especially Dylan who when i

56
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,099
first wrote to him and I said so I'm
thinking of singing my keynote and he

57
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:22,960
said I don't know and then a week later
he said we found a piano and I said okay

58
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,599
that's too so thank you crew and for
taking such good care of us not just the

59
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,378
keynote speakers all the speakers all
the attendance has been a fabulous

60
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,520
conference so thank you very very much
thank you

61
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:50,810
this next song was actually up for a
pony award this year and it we can go

62
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,710
back just a little bit there

63
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,150
it's up for Pony award and I was up
against one of the lovely ladies in the

64
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,330
front row and she saying her song coming
in on a spinning aerial hoop with

65
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:15,080
dancers so she won but i wanted to sing
this for you anyway this was released as

66
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,080
part of Poker GTFO which is a beautiful
journal is a free online journal kind of

67
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,090
in the echoes of frac and Travis good
speed is the lovely editor there or

68
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:37,460
should I say pastor min olefrog and
Phillip toy when actually made a

69
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,280
polyglot file where this song was
embedded as part of the PDF that is the

70
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,049
journal and so the journal was a zip
file a PDF and a wave pack and with the

71
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,280
wave back you could actually just play
this mp3 it just didn't look like an mp3

72
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,820
or our way back or anything it just said
PDF and you can just go on the command

73
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,219
line with mplayer VLC and then just
write back or GTFO journal and it would

74
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,660
this would play so a little bit scary
but really fun so you should check that

75
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,009
out maybe run it on a box you don't care
about too much

76
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,729
this is called roots are a girl's best
friend

77
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:31,059
the trolls are glad to refuse the
delight in online tools but i prefer a

78
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:40,509
man page that describes extensive to a
shell on the system maybe by continental

79
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:47,050
what rights are a girl's best friend to
do maybe grand but it won't pay the

80
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,680
rental on your hosting fee or help you
with the disassembly Graham gets cold as

81
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,120
exploits gets old and we all my bitcoin
in the end but exploit or shell script

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:10,869
of escalation keeps in shape girls there
may come a time when he needs a lawyer

83
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,869
rights are a girl's best friend

84
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,499
there may come a time when check from
employer offers you stock options we get

85
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,860
root rights and your own machines

86
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,310
perks will fly when stocks are high but
beware when they start to descend

87
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:41,578
machines will go online and no more
command best I've heard the server swear

88
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,479
you get admin accounts but regrets are a
girl's best friend

89
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,170
and I think that machines that you admin
yourself a better bets if nothing else

90
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,199
big data sets you next time rolls on and
entropy is not and you can't get that

91
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,260
file to prepend but big racks or botnets
you get props for route

92
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,520
she'll the system maybe by continental
sing-along roof racks are best friend

93
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,820
you don't maybe but it won't pay the
rental on your hosting fee or help you

94
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:33,130
with the disassembly Graham gets cold as
x1 itself and we call mine bitcoin in

95
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:43,450
the end but exploit or shall skip free
of escalation keeps it she rides there

96
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,060
may come a time when bernie's got lawyer
but rights are a girl's best friend

97
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,990
there may come a time when tech firm
employer offers you stock options we get

98
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,220
rights and your own machines works well
when stocks are fine but beware when

99
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,620
they start to descend machines will go
offline and no more command right

100
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:19,420
this girl's best I've heard server swear
you get admin what counts right sorry

101
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:25,449
girls best friend and I think that
machines that you admitted yourself a

102
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:31,660
better backs if nothing else big data
set your next time rolls on and entropy

103
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:39,040
is not and you can't get that file to
prepend but big racks or magnets you get

104
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
props for through

105
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,569
don't mean trailer brakes right

106
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:07,510
thank you

107
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,920
so this next song has a little bit of a
story how many of you were on Twitter

108
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,130
two years ago following along with Def
Con shenanigans

109
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,220
oh you okay there was this really cool
twitter account

110
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:33,760
um that was called I hunt pineapples and
what happened is someone or some people

111
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,980
went ahead and owned all of these people
who had bought this phone hacking tool

112
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,970
this pineapple and put this really cool
splash screen up and i'm going to read a

113
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,210
little bit from it

114
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:59,380
dear lamer you just got popped with some
code a shit so it was a beautiful splash

115
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,460
screen or if you can read the whole
thing but it's really funny and it was

116
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,540
going around on Twitter and it got
written up in various online

117
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:15,069
publications and I thought well there's
there's a song in there somewhere and so

118
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,300
I i wrote this is actually treat for me
from two years ago if you like hunting

119
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:25,270
pineapples getting rude in the rain if
you're not into PHP if you have half a

120
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,090
brain and then yeah the person who
actually did did the hack wrote back and

121
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,380
he said I'm gonna get a pony in 2015
well he was wrong because I didn't

122
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,330
release the song so I'm gonna sing it
for you now the full version not just

123
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,330
the tweet hundred and forty characters
version

124
00:12:50,730 --> 00:13:06,180
I was tired of my project I've been
working too long like a worn-out

125
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,779
recording of a favorite song

126
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:21,420
so while I lay there thinking I Ritter
and down and bury my time there were

127
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:30,689
these tweets on red you like hunting
pineapples getting road in the rain if

128
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:40,019
you're not into phb if you have half a
brain if you like making fun of noobs on

129
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:47,430
a perfect splash page it's the phone
that you look for come with me here to

130
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:56,370
escape thought it was kind of funny i
know that sounds kind of mean patrolling

131
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,030
noobs at DEFCON

132
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:06,130
that's part of the hacker scene so I
brought in my Twitter opened up

133
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,090
brand-new time though I'm nobody's poet
thought it wasn't happening

134
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,740
you sound like content pineapples
getting in the rain

135
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:33,640
I am NOT into PHP I am meant to hacking
multimeters an oscilloscope so on my lab

136
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,689
bench today thanks for posting this on
twitter you have really made my day

137
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:49,720
hacking gear for people that they don't
understand it's not the best idea

138
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:59,410
I've ever heard of and the people in the
command i teach them about permissions

139
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:08,949
so don't just lose gear without rocking
repercussions then I waited with high

140
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:20,559
hopes they prevail they were new tweet
it popped up at the top Twitter hacker

141
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,379
wasn't for security

142
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:31,149
he announced it that day so now remember
skitty's learned a poem before you play

143
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:40,899
you like constant pineapples getting
break in the rain if you don't know in

144
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:50,620
to preach be if you have half a brain
you like fun of noobs on the perfect /

145
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,819
change its the fun that you before

146
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,819
come with me here to school

147
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:06,720
thank you

148
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,780
um I want to thank whoever is advancing
this life because they're doing a very

149
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,439
good job and I we didn't have any chance
to practice we did have a little of a

150
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,200
sound check at $TIME noon so that's good

151
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:39,660
um so speaking of Twitter there's a
lovely account called Swift on security

152
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,110
and she is she's my spirit animal

153
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,959
so she's a man manifestations of taylor
swift who knows all about computer

154
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,170
security and hacking and she's amazing

155
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,540
if you don't follow her yet her she's
also called security a so if you've got

156
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,610
to get down with her so I'm gonna sing a
few songs inspired by swift on security

157
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,260
I'm not sold on security disappoint but
I did write too Swift on security and

158
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,260
she gave me her blessing for these songs

159
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,020
oh and just a little crevice I worked in
a data center for a while which I'm

160
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:28,740
gonna put on my hoodie now because I
feel cold like I'm in the cold aisle and

161
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,580
working in a data center lot of people
will call your cable monkey whatever I

162
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:43,290
designed big systems and they can shove
it so i ended up being specializing in

163
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,920
storage clusters and I don't know if any
of you know the difference between a lot

164
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,540
of hard drives in a storage cluster and
storage cluster fails prettily so that's

165
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,629
the difference between a lot of hard
drives in a search cluster um what-what

166
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,110
is frustrating about working in a data
center is being on call and

167
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,560
unfortunately I didn't get to write that
part out of my job

168
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,689
so this is a little bit about being on
call going to the data center and its

169
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,690
really late

170
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,860
min

171
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
uber picks me up those headlines

172
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,410
hard drive

173
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:59,379
good n and burning flames or paradize
fade into view

174
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:11,020
it's been awhile since I've even heard
from you heard from you I should just

175
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,270
tell you just to leave because I know
exactly where this leads but I your

176
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:23,379
dress go round and round each time
you've got that stole rich look in your

177
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,740
tracks and you got that red LED thing
that I like

178
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:36,270
and when you go brush and you come back
let's never go out of style they never

179
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,160
go out of style

180
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,559
you've got that fine dick great nuts
work and I got these do

181
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,100
skills and this black sweatshirt and
when you go crash and dump you come back

182
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,870
every time backups never go out of style
we never go out of style

183
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:05,970
so you didn't design it with failover CD

184
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,100
amazon got to provision another

185
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:21,550
I heard you've been having trouble with
your infrastructure your infrastructure

186
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,850
he says what you heard is true but i
can't something about stuff and I

187
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,129
that have been there to a few times
you've got that storage cluster look in

188
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,330
your rest and you got that red lip
classic thing that

189
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,740
when you go crash and dump you come back
every time because never go out of style

190
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,500
they never go out of style

191
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,070
you've got that fire dick great night at
work and I got these dudes

192
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:01,000
black sweatshirt and when you go crash
and you come back every time perhaps

193
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,620
never go out of style we never go out of
style so

194
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:24,200
didn't design it for failover cd3 amazon
got to provision another and I say I

195
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,630
heard you've been having trouble with
your infrastructure your infrastructure

196
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:42,320
thank you with your patience as you
can't all singing it's not my full-time

197
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:50,389
profession but hacking is so it's good
so I got half of this good

198
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,570
um so for those of you don't know thats
FC ph is a beautiful storage cluster

199
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,830
system that you can use on non
homogeneous systems it feels really well

200
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,510
so even if you've got like some big old
test thing that you gotta run

201
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,129
you know something large not about that
or anything but you know something large

202
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,870
that's local stuff is great

203
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:20,270
cph look it up it's wonderful i think
the only thing that I kind of disagree

204
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:26,570
with with security a Miss swifty on
security is that I'm a unix fan and

205
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:33,230
she's not so she will learn shall see
the error of her ways and come around to

206
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:42,320
the eunuch side but it'll take some time
to process this next song i'm old enough

207
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,120
that I'm kind of allergic to the word
cyber because when i was young and

208
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,279
online cybering meant something very
different

209
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,419
so I don't understand how it's being
used in industry and government and

210
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,369
everything it's very feels very strange

211
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:00,718
so I'm just keep that in mind when
you're listening to this one

212
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:17,039
looking at it now seemed so simple

213
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,090
we were hanging in that on twitter

214
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,530
now I remember

215
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,330
I pulled up Snowden's video

216
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,210
then discover

217
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,509
the rest of the world is now

218
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,070
hackers from

219
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:53,659
remember thinkin is a cyberwar the cyber
warrior is a cyber or are we in the

220
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:00,470
clear are we in the clear in the clear
yet is a cyber warrior cyber warrior

221
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:13,040
cyber are we in the clear we in the
clear in the clear yet in 2010 was

222
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,159
uncovered

223
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,160
centrifuges fell upon

224
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,870
Stuxnet on

225
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:32,659
burn 40 days for the hand attacking ss7
stack and motorcycle assassins go for

226
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,900
nuclear scientist it's not just cold
anymore in this cyber war as humans

227
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:47,690

yeah

231
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:40,030

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,830
started packing baby so did you

thank you

243
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,900
so I have a sort of a joke band but I'm
part of that's not really a joke anymore

244
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:13,340
because now we're a band and I'm telling
you about it so obviously it's real and

245
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:20,030
I'm my housemate my housemate Ellen and
I and our band name is with two band

246
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,430
names usually we go by the lost space
geckos as they were those geckos that

247
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,660
got lost in space on that Russian
satellite a couple years ago and then

248
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,240
sometimes we go by two standard
deviations that depends on how we we

249
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,820
started as an Abba Vulcan a back cover
band but we're not really now we just

250
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,679
play full covers and stuff and I wish
you were here with me because then you

251
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,590
know you could hear her lovely singing
voice as well but we did this song at a

252
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,560
at a campfire because that we mostly
just play house parties that's we're not

253
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:06,950
really a real being so we play this at a
campfire and she said well you you know

254
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,950
you have to play this at a conference
and I said well no conference gonna let

255
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:16,760
me play this but here I am so this is my
last song tonight and I hope you enjoy

256
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,760
it it's called when i was your man

257
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:34,220
same men but it feels just a little bit
bigger now our song on the stream but it

258
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,029
don't sound the same

259
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:44,969
all the dads friends talk about your all
doesn't just a me down

260
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:53,360
because my heart breaks a little when i
hear your name it all just sounds like

261
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:10,260
do young too dumb to know about your
hardware and helped you code i should

262
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:21,540
give my hours when I had the chance take
you to every party wanted to do was and

263
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,070
now my baby is hacking but she's hacking
with another man

264
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:35,480
pride my ego my needs my selfish way

265
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,720
as a good strong woman like you to walk
out my life

266
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:48,969

mess made

267
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,420
and it haunts me every time

268
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,030
I close my eyes

269
00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:05,649
it all just sounds like too young to
down to realize

270
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:14,669
we're help you cum should give you our

271

00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,169
although

274
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,650
I'll be the first

275
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,650
well I was wrong

276
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,790

try to apologize master

277
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,100
I just want you to know

278

282
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,240

talk to me about hardware or knitting
