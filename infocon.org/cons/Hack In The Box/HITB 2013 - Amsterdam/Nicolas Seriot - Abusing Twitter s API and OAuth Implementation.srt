well

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:15,710
well

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:20,010
yes

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,570
from hello

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,450
thank you for being here I'm very happy
2 presenter in such a great conference

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,890
with a great audience and the you too
bit special

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,850
decision because though we have among
the audience Bob lot from that with the

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,760
security team

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,030
so a let me start off my session about

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,140
to do i PI by introducing myself

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,830
so few random facts about me my
background is I US

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,909
and coke or developments so i right I
write programs for McQuistan

13
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:58,610
and iPhone and iPad from my degrees out
certain software engineering at that but

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,290
they also have a master's degree

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,710
in economic crime investigation and Iraq
for bank in Switzerland

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,440
I've been using Twitter for five years
arm

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,610
made if you out with a user could you
raise your hands

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,400
okay so I would say more than fifty
percent of you

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,510
use we don't maybe it's because you're
going in in

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,040
decision and they're so I have a 10
months baby

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,259
no the third inman's order today

22
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,299
so I'm

23
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,750
I love the slide because from it
summarizes a

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,999
who I am and what they do a it makes me
know for all the time but this is rarely

25
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:39,039
works for you my friends think I do

26
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,890
and this is what they think I do and
this is what they actually do

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,590
I spend a lot of time in front of my
computer and the

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,969
one day I decided for phone to rights

29
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:54,799
pet project which was it with the
clients so that's why that was my prime

30
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,630
motivation

31
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,439
to for this research so as you know

32
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,880
with there is not term exactly a stuffed
up anymore is grew a perm

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,780
very very quickly and in a huge way it
is last couple of years

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,330
and what disease in love interest for me
today

35
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,280
is Dabi imagine you are writing a
Twitter client what you are interested

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,480
in is the API but you have to understand

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,290
the changes fruit without arm to
understand the changing seasons the i'd

38
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,880
a PI

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,470
so back in today's you could access and
post tweets

40
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,150
Weezer mmm with basic authentication

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,430
and entry to introduce the oo's API

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,130
and since last month you have to use
owes API

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,400
version 1.1 which requires every request

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,130
to be signed

45
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,020
additionally Twitter are has chances the
rules for displaying the tweets

46
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,230
from you have to adopt a very strict
rules

47
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,160
and and Terms of Service you have to the
space between

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,490
exactly this way and no other way all
right we would be honored to serve the

49
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,080
API

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,240
you have to displays a.m. is it thanks
them

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,060
in the bottom left you have to displays
a logo in a certain way

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,320
and from you also have over and people
love for additional limitations

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,190
related to your Twitter client for
example it with a client can never have

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,400
more than no one 100 thousand users

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,520
only from additional users were just too

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,910
can't login so in a general way to the
top

57
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,410
discourages arm Twitter planes
developments

58
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,280
it is a it is to adjust policy right
okay so

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,180
what if firm up what means what that he
can mean

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,240
Twitter have to enforce or this policy

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,650
well since last month arm

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,020
every request has to be signed with some

63
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,650
form of private key and if you
obligation

64
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,840
does not respect as the Terms of Service
that we'd always simply revoke

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,830
your keys and your petition we start
from Sony so that's how

66
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,360
Twitter controls and enforce his policy
but

67
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,650
of course if you think about it what's
from

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,209
with a point of view makes your request
seem legit

69
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,380
or not and how can't we don't know that

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,630
term some request is coming from so
Twitter application for my quest then

71
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,699
of all to the application for Android
from

72
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,729
to the okays I D behind that you haven't
stood at

73
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,800
if you can spoof some HOE owners a way
that

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,199
some religious application sends it

75
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,520
its request then you would be able to
write your own clients

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,189
arm that would look pledges from we
don't but

77
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:56,080
with be in fact the rug Lions so the
question is a.m.

78
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,830
is it possible to of course is it
possible but to understand how

79
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,939
we can do that we have to to

80
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,699
to see exactly po to tell you these
oocysts

81
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,009
I realize this picture because im

82
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,729
overseas own pretty complicated process
it makes season

83
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,569
authentication and authorization and

84
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,229
you have different scenarios that can
expose them

85
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,990
people from their abilities I I will
explain after

86
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,610
some problem for from security
standpoint

87
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,020
but for no I we just presents on how to
tell you these are almost

88
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,590
and to show you okay we could broza
ara-c but it's a not very funny

89
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,999
so I'm I tried to explain graphically
what's going on with this notation

90
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:50,020
okay so this is a client this is a self
obsessed with their rights

91
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,539
and here I sent the client sends a
request token

92
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,849
a token is just a string basically its
value included in the stream

93
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:01,590
and this is a response sewing if this
case we sense

94
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,639
the yellow talkin and we get back the
route again

95
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,860
and here is the same thing but the
request he signs a

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,870
signed with the screen star but restart
is never a sense

97
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,009
is just used to send a request okay it
is just

98
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:22,840
sanitation I'm going to use to explain
you too does jose 240

99
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,639
was the first gave is the much do you
have some kind of firm

100
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,819
um your third party service from the
internets

101
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:35,919
yeah I i chose BT which is a bookmark
manager or I don't even know exactly

102
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,930
but it could be any so decent internet
so you once to

103
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,400
authorize a service to use your account
was going on

104
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,870
you ask as a Service to

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,259
from a user account than

106
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,680
you to deal with your return you around
with

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,039
arm request opens you will authorized

108
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,499
this request occurrence and is the third
party service will get back

109
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:06,330
it is very 5.0 can and if you think
about it at this point

110
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,050
the third party service can prove
without that

111
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,169
you have authorized theme to use your
account

112
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:17,819
but you've never sent your password
you've never given you pass web

113
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,550
to with the party saudis so that's what
those is about

114
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,120
you have authorize that their party to
use your account between

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,599
did not send your best world

116
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:32,020
at the end of the process arm what is it

117
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,479
important is or disagree tokens this
isn't easy access tokens

118
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,309
which I use both for sale even request
and the

119
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:43,400
sending the public but earns it public
talkin

120
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,520
tomb interact with with our API

121
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,520
so this is the first days when you have
a third party

122
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,849
a civil case is a variant of these so
look what is standing here

123
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:04,139
this is a case over disturb clients
imagine you are using goat with other up

124
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,699
from a quest n

125
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,069
um this is a transaction to it

126
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,020
it could do um the so it's

127
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,520
it's basically the same thing but owns a
request on its end from the third party

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,119
server

129
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:25,119
but from supply and under their stuff

130
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:29,069
from you could wonder why it is so
complicated why do we have

131
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,279
free a free phases authentication you
could be is just the icing palestinian

132
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,839
your login and password

133
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,729
or maybe housing OB user and the
disintegration

134
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,060
I'm when there is a variance in it's
called expose

135
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,950
in expose you just its is just one faith

136
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,360
you send signs a request and you send
along

137
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,779
your username and password you have to
send them some over the network

138
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,880
and Twitter or directory and response
with access tokens

139
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,060
and then you can interact with the epic
API

140
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,509
always the last to use gays I'm going to
present it's the

141
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:13,009
very recent it was introduced a guess
the last month

142
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,130
and that's cause a beer or two can it to
be special imagine he wants to make

143
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,600
request which are not

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,980
from without use of context the you
could there have been a petition

145
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,670
reading the time public time-line
ordering phelps's

146
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,899
but not loathe to access direct messages

147
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,130
all what's the status from because

148
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,199
this way you send -ism this to to
conceal

149
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,389
and you get a beer at the Cannes be
rockettes it means that's when you are

150
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:42,480
holding this token

151
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,350
it's okay you can perform request with
32 and get them nine

152
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,470
and you can also invalidated took an I
will come back later and the security

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,430
implications of this

154
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,320
so I've tried to present graphically
what's going on info casey's

155
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,490
of authentication when you want them to
get with our host

156
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,839
to use it tweet or API so you've noticed
that

157
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,310
in or four cases we used these

158
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,880
the slogans here they are very important
the other consumer tokens

159
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,240
it is values that are embedded ins
application

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,410
if I used with about I former Quester in
these values up of

161
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,810
of with other that ap they are part of
my binary fide

162
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,470
they have to be in the first place 'em

163
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:36,410
in the binary so that they can start
there's a also owes process

164
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,610
it means that if I have this the

165
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,860
green and sorry the spread and you know

166
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,279
tokens I can impersonate a.m.

167
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,319
the client who holds

168
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:53,940
this tokens and I can do all these

169
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,940
going to for them to tensions by
spoofing its identity

170
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,959
so I would like to show you how easy to
rape of

171
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,399
own consumer tokens from the team mates
with the clients

172
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,300
in fact arm maybe you're here because
you and our student without but

173
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,420
I we show you techniques that you will
be able to use in your own research in

174
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,000
your own projects which are not
necessarily related to 3.8 just because

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,220
it's so fun and nice

176
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,339
in the very effective techniques

177
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,180
for the first technique is the most
abuse one maybe so you will know

178
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,329
is a strength Cummins it's a UNIX
command that

179
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:36,620
terms the strings a printable characters
in a binary file

180
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,079
so it turns out that so you can simply
Dempster consumer coupons motto can

181
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,649
from as a Twitter are official
application

182
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,519
official play in from a question so is
that even hiking

183
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,850
is just the reading in the binary rights

184
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,350
so we could best the tokens %uh the
valid

185
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,470
I tried to have put some demos are in
inmate ok

186
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,970
I could have 'em recorded everything but
it's much more often

187
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,290
life so this is great price this great

188
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,259
which will just this the tokens which
have been

189
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:21,259
don't from that with a binary

190
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,500
if I run the script

191
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,279
i get some unauthorized authorize your
I'll

192
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,029
in the slides we've seen that we aren't

193
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,709
we are in this case I could do not arise
URL

194
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,990
I wheeler authorize with my Twitter
account and then we get

195
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,449
a pin that there with them back to
Twitter and I will get

196
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,910
a.m. the tokens at the end of the
process

197
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,540
so here we go I opened this your hour

198
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:00,540
in a browser

199
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,549
so on Twitter has recognized that
consumer tokens from

200
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:09,509
to the format and basically I just
wanted to show you

201
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:14,009
that it works it is raise its ok and so
I authorize op

202
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:21,009
I we get the pin

203
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,449
that they will could be my terminal and
I really

204
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:31,449
eventually gets a access tokens

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,520
okay try again

206
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,400
okay nevermind what to what you so with
that

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,660
into consumer to consumer extracted
where r really

208
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,830
are the ones from to tell a for Mac

209
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,980
but

210
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,130
very many applications in minutes with
the clients arm

211
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,550
the strings a consumer tokens are not
simply puts

212
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,670
a in the binary file they are some HOE
he done

213
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,390
obfuscated so you have to use the term

214
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,300
other techniques to 336 tokens and when
technique is a obviously

215
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,130
to use gdb so

216
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,260
into the BU would do something like this
in

217
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,360
its aerodynamic technique a.m. I am NOT
speaking about

218
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,400
idea of 30 to reverse engineering
techniques which are much more

219
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,130
complicated

220
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,680
I'm just presenting some very efficient

221
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,920
and simple techniques and between they
are dynamic techniques it means that you

222
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,390
have to interrupt is a program

223
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,460
to extract the tokens what we're doing
here

224
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,400
that we putting a break point on the
fence on if the it is objective-c code

225
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,430
if you've never think that it is a class
of

226
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:11,000
are since 10th and this is a method
3/02/13 breaking

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,270
owns a method that will return to
consumer key

228
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,140
and the consumer secret on which process
own

229
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,440
Weston becomes the comes the man it is

230
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,589
as a process that's that handle Azeem

231
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:31,080
McQuiston Twitter account and very few
can read urgently be then

232
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,839
you see that I'm breaking and suffering
some I just finished a function

233
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,290
I say a.m. when you need consumer key
okay

234
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,330
breaked finish the function and read the
return value of the from some

235
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,290
and that its and it's a token I'm going
to gym

236
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,430
though so this is a consumer cuban
consumer secrets from

237
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,310
McQuistan open point 8 from

238
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,410
they are not licked you can google it
them down its public

239
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,510
so don't worry I raise my slides without

240
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,270
these values but my point is that anyone
can find them

241
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,430
I will discuss the up so out there

242
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,260
security consequences maybe I will do a
Nevada mo

243
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm I would extract with the same
technique

244
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,720
from consumer key and secret from

245
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,160
I with six how they do

246
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,160
well

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,370
I can simply launch the iPhone simulator
so I have assimilate of the US six

248
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,130
running here

249
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,650
and they resume I'm into a PKC

250
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,829
I was sitting if you want and you can
enter

251
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,320
your Twitter account it is integrated in
the US 6

252
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,320
and five or so so what I'm going to do
is %uh I am going to attach

253
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,589
arm sifted as this process a comes the
Iranians are

254
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:05,100
I fans may top so is a PITA is this one

255
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:12,100
so here we go okay

256
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,750
no I want to break under very function
that will return consumer key on

257
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,760
and consumer secrets if I don't know
them I can

258
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,510
look for them with in for frank maybe

259
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,770
consumer good

260
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,970
iPhones a objective-c methods that will
return confirmacion personal secret

261
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,490
then I put a breakpoint here

262
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,570
I put in November 20th

263
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,830
and I continue running the program

264
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,200
no what they have to do with that I have

265
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
to interact with the program and set up
for Twitter account

266
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,660
a real or fake it doesn't matter what's
will happen did that at some point the

267
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,960
program will require

268
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,820
the consumer can consume a secret and my
BB I will break

269
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:04,720
so I enter something said you were gonna
breadth

270
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,910
and

271
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,550
so you can seize a back trace

272
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,679
I'm here so I will lead defense and
finished

273
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,480
and I will

274
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,340
prints as a returner value as a function
so this is

275
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,340
this is the consumer key of US 6th

276
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,480
I continue I breaking consumer secret

277
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,720
same trick finish the function

278
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,720
friends return value and this is are the
secret key

279
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,250
so as you can see is you it's a very
effective

280
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,980
texted and you can use it once again for
many other things

281
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,980
for maybe you your your own projects but
sometimes you do not have

282
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,120
as a address offense and that will
return to consume not your secrets

283
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,370
how would you do then you have many
other techniques so

284
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,900
when I like you most is attempting
delegated by Intel's

285
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,900
this is I tried to re prison simply so
the binary file

286
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,260
that we some 0 analyze statically with a
strengthened

287
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,860
command but wants it is loaded into
memory

288
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,940
address the memory is so what can you do
where where can you find

289
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,560
the tokens was 80 here is to don't

290
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,780
a every every point out that we go
through the free from sin

291
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,880
and the trick is to use

292
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,680
perm 33's probe maybe you know the
traces the process running

293
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,020
from ZAR Journal very use a space

294
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,700
and you can right simply strengthen

295
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,500
instructions with a antenna subset of
the ceiling which and this

296
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,600
you know this command a is very very
simple but so effective I I don't need

297
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,490
it's the it's hard to imagine something
nothing but I would show you

298
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,900
ho tumhi how to log

299
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,010
every day to that goes froze a free
function

300
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,730
and I'm going to use its to capsules a

301
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:20,730
sickies from a question so I just have
to find a bid

302
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,940
for becomes the running on my my
question

303
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,940
well

304
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,770
here it is and here we go

305
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,230
so I have to interact with the program
was a process

306
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,550
what we're weather will do is I went out
with their account

307
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,080
worked with their is made this account

308
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,370
my regular I counties and is to: 21 and
make this the county's 02

309
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:04,370
sign you

310
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:23,470
okay I'm not as a right networks or

311
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,220
the idea here these that at some point
the application will use

312
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,220
is a consumer in

313
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,549
key and consumer secrets to sign the
requests that will be sent to Twitter

314
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,940
and then it will get a dedicated and at
this point I have Tim's

315
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,289
as a string so here we are tourism

316
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,549
the some random data that when follows a
free function

317
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,740
but when there were strings

318
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,519
they are simply looked so can we find
the keys from a question here

319
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,700
and trying to take a bit because I know

320
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,240
sickies just to show you with that they
are

321
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,620
effectively among the strings that good
dent

322
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,210
up

323
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,600
because it is the consumer secret former
Quester

324
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,210
so yep

325
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,039
it was a very from it is a decade of

326
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,559
and you can apply to many projects but
in real life maybe

327
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,730
on my quest and you would do you would
use 'em its objective c- capability

328
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,529
affirm injecting code in a running
process

329
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:47,299
arm this way what are we doing here

330
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,570
I'm using gdb I'm not going to
demonstrate it but I i want to mention

331
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,419
it because

332
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,919
is very easy to do you can compare it is
coded

333
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,230
into a framework and that we loaded
dynamically

334
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,940
a in the process address space you take
advantage of firm

335
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,250
I didn't as objective-c runtime
capabilities

336
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,990
used to dynamically load some code and
where does this go do

337
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,000
well ever you basically you're adding a
methodist

338
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,490
2&3 and you're replacing to TLK to me
said

339
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,690
which is going to generate an
objective-c you're replacing the regular

340
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,289
your look with my developed

341
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,669
which does exactly the same but just
before calling the regular misled

342
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,000
it love the string which gets the
indicated

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,549
so even if you tried to to hide

344
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,080
is a key is insurance application there
are many

345
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,139
very efficient and simple techniques to
find the keys

346
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:49,139
so

347
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,409
they are many other techniques and
another one I love

348
00:23:55,409 --> 00:24:00,520
is a simply dumping the whole process
memory once again the idea that at some

349
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
point you are

350
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,059
and your application has to use the
city's keys for computations in signing

351
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:06,679
stuff

352
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,820
so it has to get into the memory even
those 'em

353
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,889
is over US$3 would get never delegated

354
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:18,970
at some point E three seats its its
leaves is a memory so if you don't have

355
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,149
a good memory contents

356
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:24,169
you if you will seats in my quest in

357
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,190
another platforms like Linux entity as

358
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,549
some capabilities to do that but it
doesn't welcome

359
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,090
my question on request and what I found
it that you can use

360
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,440
but you got 64 which is a

361
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,850
third-party application if you want that
is part of the book

362
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,340
my question to announce from I mean
thing

363
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,840
so you just gives a did

364
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,870
up the process and it takes a quite a
lot of time

365
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,309
if because a memory card back and a
great big in the dorms

366
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:59,299
an object by with everything in it if
you want to run the strength command you

367
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:00,010
have to

368
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,440
cleanups ahead of so that is not
recognize them as a

369
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,240
Benari fight and you can run strength
and a.m.

370
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
so I'm tempting here a bit binary fine

371
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,539
and I'm taking out two strains from his
bank binary file

372
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,760
and the Celts you is self unique

373
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,820
so I'm expecting the strings and making
me

374
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,260
its each three unique so that's if I
lose much

375
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,309
smaller and we know from

376
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,309
from Twitter document API documentation
that

377
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:36,900
the same key much be must be a consumer
secrets

378
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,770
up indeed with an end to send so you can
raise the right some rejects that we

379
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,270
extracts from use butter on

380
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:53,270
and you will very easily find the keys

381
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,780
so yet another or mean in the in the
hallway

382
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,970
to find the keys -ism to Google as a key
prosecution to state consumer key

383
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,559
personal secrets and it turns out that
many

384
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,880
application developers a pro the keys on
the term off-base been no

385
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,510
is very easy easy to find when

386
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,960
I i'm looking for. 30 minutes I wrote
twenty minutes

387
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,160
so maybe this is not very important what
is important is that some

388
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,590
so to understand the in and outs and
Riley

389
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,650
typically how things were working I
wrote my own

390
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,360
Twitter library from a question I'm

391
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,040
it's gone St three-term and basically
you are free ways to use it you can use

392
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,730
it as your

393
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,890
regular account that wasn't up through
my question preferences

394
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,140
you can use a.m. run them consumer
tokens you ever found

395
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:55,870
and you can also use a up a new
authentication I'm

396
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,980
this is a front and from my library

397
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,110
it's just that best friend and it's not
it's not

398
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,220
term your rates with our clients

399
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,400
and I wanted to demonstrates Hubertus

400
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,400
I can show you you

401
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,550
the screen is too small I cannot access

402
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,250
the season at the bottom so I will just
explaining what it does

403
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,090
basically you choose

404
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,740
as identity or for to the client because
you've extracted

405
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,060
a consumer Q&A smoke cigarettes first
application you choose to a petition

406
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,950
you can login you can exit down an at 99
and you can post

407
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,650
I just wanted to to do a demonstration
by per Steve

408
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,710
without these coordinates which are
actually Fukushima nuclear reactor No

409
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,100
coordinates but it was just for fun was
just to show you that

410
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,630
when you write your own to the clients
you impersonates a regular one

411
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,130
by stealing

412
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,540
as a consumer can secret and then you
are free from

413
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,930
a Twitter stomach service and by the way
since the cyber is going to be

414
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,690
integrated into a region which is 'em

415
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,820
multi-protocol chat client from a
question

416
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,820
you so I stride also to write my own
Twitter clients it'll be tough but

417
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,700
projected to notify projected doesn't

418
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,970
already work but it let me experience
with them

419
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,190
my phone ID is like a a skirt

420
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,710
adding getting giving a score to each
tweets basins it also offers a keyword

421
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,160
into tweets and for presenting two
schools are hearing your

422
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,370
you can if South and what you could do
it so is a

423
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,430
because you are no free to present
information as one so you could

424
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,680
represent the discussions graphically

425
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,450
this is also important

426
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,700
Jennifer side projects but related to it
we don't

427
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,640
this is the way I found to encode binary
formation

428
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,720
into into a tweets from

429
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,000
the idea here was to to back

430
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,700
by no information to transform binary
information into unique a terror into

431
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,850
Chinese character else

432
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,980
and with this kind of treats the don't
doubt that you can

433
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,370
you can back 164 bytes

434
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,640
you know one of six characters I'm

435
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,010
this is a mind the this is a

436
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:30,350
with tiny tiny McQuiston executable file

437
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,980
that term is can be represented in a
tweet with the street

438
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,510
in fact if you're wondering what they do
is they take

439
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,560
12 beats transform your in a Chinese
character has been twinned

440
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,170
12 bits into it a Chinese characters and
then you can

441
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,910
stuff rebates into to Unicode characters
well

442
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,430
again going to speed up

443
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:59,260
so be I tried to explain how to do is
using

444
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,880
oo's I fry to show you how to report

445
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,100
consume up to guns and constable secret
from applications

446
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,720
and knowing going to discuss the
situation from a security point of view

447
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,120
so first I think that it was somehow I'm

448
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,520
Nero to transpose from

449
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,700
the situation and the web with this
property several

450
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,400
to the desktop because here this
consumer secrets

451
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,680
West used by you feel spotty cell you
could not access it's

452
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,370
with you when it's running on your
desktop anybody with a Minsky's

453
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,980
and little time and the skis can find
discuss mckeon

454
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,980
and secret I don't find it very
realistic talent that some

455
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,080
with %uh can revoke leaked keys because
especially if

456
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,120
keys form important and widespread alarm
systems a puppy and applications like a

457
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,810
US always them because if

458
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:59,250
with or even two keys a nobody will be
able to use to be done to his next start

459
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,630
date

460
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,330
own I'm also not convinced that

461
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,890
XO sees a much better that than

462
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,120
SDPD justice indication index ot

463
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,760
client application the need to store the
bus world so it's a good bone fide

464
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,490
source but

465
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,870
from but at some point

466
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,410
if so send them so the bus world's earns
the first request

467
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,860
I'm or so about this up a nuisance
addition

468
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,860
something is a ineffective and interests

469
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,520
because what's going on here if you if
you can extract the consumer secret

470
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,400
and consumer key then you can get a beer
after can you can use it

471
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,630
use it use it again and exists the
limits which is set by

472
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,980
Twitter so dis ineffective didn't have
service for this application for

473
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,360
certification we have you ever taken the
tokens

474
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,160
but whilst you can also invalidates
token

475
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,660
and imagine the petition which to would
seep

476
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,800
with the bureau to go inside between
validated token

477
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,010
then also petitioners at least 10
seasons application with

478
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,400
stop working it's why I think it's

479
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,590
me I can I i don't think it's such a
good design

480
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,250
i think thats OC's a

481
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,090
pretty complicated process and we found
that it's not

482
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,360
your able to reliably identifies
appliance

483
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,710
and additional it was a user at at risk

484
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,980
imagine somebody whom my is a to the
user but is not a hiker is not

485
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,140
programmer he loses his iPhone

486
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,270
he was chance -ism male bus world

487
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,440
is so that's a fee for the iPhone we
will not be able to use made

488
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,490
which aims his Twitter password so
that's a thief will not be able to use

489
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,530
his without converting

490
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,570
hit but you will because tempting for
bus where does the three books access to

491
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:51,990
guns

492
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,830
so this is this is of course it's not
intuitive for users

493
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,160
and as the processes

494
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,000
convoluted expose arm

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,420
vulnerabilities and I we show it you
very bad for your ability

496
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,530
charities maybe as I am I do City Mo

497
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,320
it's more effective

498
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,679
so what I'm going to do is to use some

499
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,700
application which I know that is badly
configured

500
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,710
I'd we choose 3 Dec and

501
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,870
because they're so to Dickies productive
to thrive think it was but buy Twitter

502
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,750
I'm going to specified a custom

503
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,970
call back

504
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,720
and arm I so use the slide and barrel in

505
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,020
because for that to understand what's
going on I did his first week with

506
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,120
and they both the blue tokens and I'm
going to trick

507
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,550
victims to authorize this tokens with
his Twitter account

508
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,870
so look the these

509
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,910
these are the booth opens also can

510
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,850
also consider it I said I can post this
URL

511
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,890
on the forum I can write a male to male
victim and say okay

512
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,190
check out with their arm mmm

513
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,770
to go to somebody's account I i don't
know

514
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,230
the point is that the victim will opens
are you on

515
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:30,230
it arrives from okay I'm not loved sorry
I just have to look in before

516
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,290
okay so I'm the victim I i'm not as
amnesty 022

517
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,440
you can see I click on leave

518
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,350
I'm into the website everything is fine
I see the look ACPs perfect

519
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,290
a tweed a great rest I authorize the app
fine

520
00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:00,260
I'm on my Twitter page perfect but

521
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,280
what happened if that in fact I
redecorated

522
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,930
you remember I wrote a custom call back

523
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,520
side redirected as a authorization a
token

524
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,620
to my silver I sent me an email

525
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,110
and the redirected to use a lot to tell
so for the user

526
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,760
distant with the web page

527
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,760
he has not noticed anything but in my
email

528
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,820
I have received this very fire and is
very fire

529
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,430
is the pink one

530
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,750
here so what they can do is use it

531
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,410
to login and gets access tokens for the
user

532
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,750
and nice for you you know

533
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,650
you yes get time nine from

534
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,180
I'm using is a account from amnesty 022

535
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,609
I'm the Pirates i three amnesty 022

536
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:14,190
into authorizing this tokens and

537
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,900
he did not notice anything but I can now
access his account

538
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,310
both on his behalf excesses direct
messages and so on

539
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:28,310
the risks

540
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,040
they are abuse but I'd set cedar last
night with

541
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,589
some some love u& ur he said the but to

542
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:40,200
describes a risk so the risk are you can
maybe

543
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,920
even sorry a I can use it in TR some
company

544
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,410
and announce a profit warning and said i
buy stocks I dunno

545
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,000
you can make fun of your favorite
politician all-black made people who is

546
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,830
direct message went things can go bad so

547
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:03,440
my conclusion is that some I'm not show
that overseas are very effective way

548
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,240
to to enhanced retails AJ security

549
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,130
I understand their weight was done but
the reality that

550
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,380
I'm it's too easy to cheat andar

551
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,580
since it is complicated expose your new
vulnerabilities

552
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,880
and I'm not sure it's a very easy to do
with the

553
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,380
to to maintain an API opens to

554
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,359
the party clients but oh some violence
and the reject some other ones

555
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,170
a.m. since the trains are running in

556
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:38,359
in under the owner with this stuff and
can be subject to analysis

557
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:44,290
so I'm it's a tricky problem okay

558
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,400
I just have free besides I wanted to
show you

559
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,560
because we have time okay I

560
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,760
iPhone this picture was fun I too good
for Twitter I'm so dominate funded

561
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,000
so mmm is that

562
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,750
really related to abusing 22 API but
more to the plane's

563
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,109
iPhone though couple love for

564
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:09,950
weeks ago maybe that this sequence of
character this is

565
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,230
Unicode characters 12 free for FY 2005
Unicode character of

566
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,330
they make I P Weston clients

567
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,580
crash if you if you write this him

568
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,660
in a terminar the time that we crash

569
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,830
my question cannot represent this
correct else and makes

570
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,540
civil process crash so the idea here

571
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,849
is that if you are able to send this
character's on Twitter

572
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,530
what will happen with with the clients
I'm a quest in trying to display

573
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:47,530
the string forest right so this is a
script

574
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,820
I'm going to post a.m.

575
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,820
this sequence of character and maybe
before I will start

576
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,770
term for this is Twitter no

577
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,869
official claim from a quest then and I'm
going to

578
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:12,280
to post my crashing correct else

579
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,810
this is and is to: to one account
following amnesty 022

580
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,180
I'm posting on amnesty 022 account and
look

581
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,540
I crushed aren't without addition

582
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,190
because it cannot represent correctly
the string I've posted

583
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,390
I can try to start it again his crush

584
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,760
again its pressure I can stop the
overall with a client from a question

585
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,900
socialite tries to get a tweets it
crushed

586
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,580
so is therefore you're using to type BA
but she's still earn

587
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,220
exam abusing your no estan vulnerability
in some way

588
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,859
so this is a

589
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,640
sex race and that's it I'm over

590
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,670
arm thank you for listening this is my

591
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,220
regular 22 I don't I won't pose to
anything interesting it you can follow

592
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,560
me

593
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,150
arm and this is a nutty Collis return

594
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,819
explaining are the days and I was
referring sees

595
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:14,830
on my source code everything I did is a

596
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,890
Republican so I just didn't

597
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,500
put to serve food keys in my slides

598
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,660
not to be embarrassing for anybody but

599
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,060
term I hope you enjoyed and once again
my point was to

600
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,970
prison my results and also give you some
tools ID's and techniques you can use

601
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,950
for you on receps

602
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:39,950
thank you here we have some time left so
if you have any questions from the

603
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,700
command

604
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:48,700
just that

605
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,810
quick question did some day you don't
recommend using Twitter clients

606
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,390
using the web I'm sorry could you repeat
you recommand

607
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,990
not using Twitter client singers using
the web interface

608
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,460
traded get around this type server issue
sir

609
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,970
and no I didn't I'm not a way of
specific issues though using and Twitter

610
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,760
on the web

611
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,950
I didn't Luke the

612
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,680
it would be interesting to know if
access tokens are sufficient to interact

613
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,860
with the way the

614
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,860
tweet on the web but term I didn't
freeze up his spot
