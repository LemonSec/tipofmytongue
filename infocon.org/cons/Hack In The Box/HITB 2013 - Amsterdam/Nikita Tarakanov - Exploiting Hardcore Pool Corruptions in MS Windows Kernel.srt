1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,380
well

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,380
yeah I'll

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,650
yes

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,600
so lower on I'm naked director of

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,870
first though I wanna say that it's a
great honor to me

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,540
to give a talk that pick in the box the
second time in a row

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,810
and today arm gun talk about

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,940
exploding a previously an exploitable

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,170
Uppal corruption Microsoft Windows
kernel I

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,309
so first fight about me you know

11
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,600
on Twitter page FF several hell yes it's
like crazy while the russian a line of

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,210
Starz's

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,640
but basically I am just nice dude and
you know

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,309
I'm calm within the band security
researcher from Russian now

15
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,910
I have kind of russian special sense of
your

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,910
okay much so and basically we gonna talk
to a bit about previous research

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,620
a them to be discourse it so

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,980
new approach and them to I'll talk about
some conclusion

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,190
and I'll question-and-answer fiction so

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,370
from at the moment so exportation world

21
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,280
a goes in the you know what direction

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,090
when a mayor Ben they were so

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,210
make some make station when you have to

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,410
have a lot of for or you don't
combination

25
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,570
flour mill just to compromise up box

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,000
for example mobile chrome are

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,180
there is some walks iraq's for their son
book so

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,360
first of all you have to bypass as a
large DP

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,780
and then escape sandbox and the

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,220
actually Microsoft when this girl arm

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,890
hasn't up from China wanted to build

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,319
I great sandbox a and the

33
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,200
for example GTI is a good actor fought
back from a set some box

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,620
good example on leather a last want all

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,360
nielsen Joan from while MW our laps

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,379
own Google Chrome use among for a
built-in that kid

37
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,330
and next the they attack when this girl
so basically

38
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,819
the didn't attacker from some books

39
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,909
they just bypass it use its own
liability

40
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:38,659
I think a at the moment there is no in
for about the

41
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,900
in which exact company into we know sees
it in when

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,370
32k dots is so is it in and just grown
self but

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,670
I meaning that they too will the that

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,730
the exploited

45
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,959
colonel durable overflow knowing this
girl

46
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,010
so I'll there is a for the

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,349
up calculator with system talkin

48
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,689
sold from untrusted from some bucks
process the

49
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,349
gained two for compromise so I think
it's cool

50
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,680
so you know we're

51
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,879
I make some statistic research

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,139
and from 2008 year I can say that to him

53
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,249
most of the a

54
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:29,019
local privilege escalation was to the
religious and Microsoft girl

55
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,799
r Memory corruptions and they're just a
little bit of

56
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,959
stack overflows more for them koppel
corruptions

57
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,090
and the that's why Microsoft the in
Kansas the

58
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,560
security of poor Kate or it starts from

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,620
Microsoft started from will sound occurs

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,909
to win the 70 for catered was so

61
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,939
pretty vulnerable to easiest attack and
the

62
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,120
in Windows 8 poor cater is so

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,519
kinda football proof but there are still
up

64
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,529
attacks again soul

65
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:06,459
a there is a

66
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,150
reeling good the research out there
about Paul locator mechanisms

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,349
and though in my opinions the most the

68
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,620
comprehensive one is my project mount

69
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,799
and the by the way I am I was in
Blackheath

70
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,990
in March and the sympathetically you

71
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,650
a talked about so some nice

72
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,380
the techniques to manipulates a keep and
pool

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,850
a very per size with two make

74
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,590
pool to appropriate state to for
exportation on when the state

75
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,949
so we starts

76
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,300
with some basics basically a a curable
is just the

77
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,050
Key button colonel and I'm

78
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,110
really I'm curious why a microsoftr

79
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,530
the goals at the pool

80
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,970
actually its key but a cable I my

81
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,169
the mayor difference between your own
keeper

82
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,770
the there're a different types of my
hours there are not based who

83
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,470
based full session pool a and them beach
ball described by

84
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,629
structure %uh the rails

85
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,120
toward in the in defining in XXX to rate

86
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,129
so here is a just so

87
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:30,389
output from to buy your there are two
fields in the

88
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,490
descriptor of cool but the

89
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,520
and the most interesting warm love is a
our lease finance and pension freeze

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,860
so release cats just the array of for

91
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,080
double increased a free chunks the same
size

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,650
cause there is a 5 under tandoor 12

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,509
entries and the grim reality is a bite

94
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:59,569
so Lisa gets a store

95
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,289
I'll chunks from a bite to

96
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,580
a close to page sizes though 4,000

97
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,599
and 80 bytes so

98
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:13,870
arm to describe for

99
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,139
allocated memory there is a will have
her a

100
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,289
structure were and there is the fields
which

101
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,610
precise cool in the books I school type:
tech

102
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,349
they describe or just the size of
government of pregos

103
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,250
the chunks also cool index a

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,530
a stores a index of all

105
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,930
where's that chunk for sites I'll

106
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,439
actually people had her own 30 you to be
from

107
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,610
64bits I'll not the same but the

108
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,810
the only difference is the that on 64
bits is there is a

109
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,539
me points or so process

110
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,039
and because a it's a 64bits the

111
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,889
granularity with both a bigger so if for

112
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,979
on 32 bytes 32bits a.m.

113
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:10,500
a very insistent on the RT is a a bites
on

114
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,580
64 64-bit severin system

115
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,379
very autism 16 so

116
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,439
when the Junkers the free

117
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,210
is fried after the ball hair is there's
a least entry

118
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,449
basically it's just structure the

119
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,240
stores points or two for work junk

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,560
24 worked for John can't backcourt

121
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,409
so missus call it all looks like an
graphic

122
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,569
old and them

123
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,939
basically a causa a

124
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,969
Carol fool a was made to

125
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,400
a there are a lot of Albertans and the

126
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,770
for small allocations there is a
different

127
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,590
at least called the Lok aside and for

128
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,719
small a allocations

129
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,110
as there is a in ok aside the road
course at least

130
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,400
and the stored and defining process
going to walk

131
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,370
and the for the maximum size is a

132
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,240
256 bytes so

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,650
and the the there is change a

134
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,409
me there is a single least

135
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:29,090
ok leukocyte the is a single list and
the

136
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,520
police itself doubling least

137
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,000
soul so in graphical you see that

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
there's only points or the next one
soldiers

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,080
no pointer to back work jump

140
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,850
so for great location so that bigger

141
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,870
than pagesize there is a

142
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,990
and Mac mechanisms for a gating

143
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,329
pages and there is pressure though

144
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,459
I think it's it was down for performance
reasons

145
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:06,660
a key for there are

146
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,200
least for one page application a

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,880
to pager three-page user you for

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,630
bigger location is requested there is a

149
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,860
amid map which India describes a

150
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,630
which page is located which is free and
soul

151
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,850
so basically as a relative for functions

152
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,490
to allocates memory in colonel and about

153
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,700
in the ANSA the all invoke exhort people
with stacks so it's kind of

154
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,480
one an only interface of allocated
memory

155
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,950
and the basic algorithm Mar

156
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,070
returns the free China new chunk for

157
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,389
first the it the looks for leukocyte
release them

158
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,700
lick list cats and will pay to occur by
the way

159
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,850
by for example in the some manipulation
techniques a

160
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,740
there is a technique to at the store a
lot of

161
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,690
chunks in leukocyte least and

162
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,500
allocation underwritten works in this
way you focus at least of all

163
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,649
up it's a returns free chunk from with
pets

164
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,170
so the is this is just order

165
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,480
of for location

166
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,040
them one of the key point

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,430
of this research is that all

168
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,389
terrible our care allocates first the

169
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,160
junk a at the top and the

170
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,570
secondary and the following location:

171
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,250
from the bottom and the

172
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,040
junk car of for first location

173
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,290
has besides the which is the role

174
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,029
you know

175
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,320
he it will result in some cool stuff

176
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,449
which show discos a little later so

177
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,540
a when though the

178
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,860
you have to free some a memory there is
a also a lot of for

179
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,490
functions to free but in Tampico X
people with dark

180
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,940
and basically X triple stack

181
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,350
returns chunk other to appropriate least

182
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,380
and the there is a also me one of the
key point

183
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,589
hopeful techniques that you for

184
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,910
adjacent blocks are also free

185
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,990
a ok or caterer merch

186
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,040
so also it's called coalescence

187
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,269
a free chunks to reduce fragmentation
soul

188
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,089
for example this station you for was
there is a free

189
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,620
junk next is busy and necks is also free

190
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,750
when the you free busy chunk a

191
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,860
allocation algorithm looks you for
adjacent blocks

192
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,139
of also free and the occasion other
Mercat

193
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,410
it to bigger and bigger so invent

194
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,199
a we get just one beak

195
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,399
free champ so

196
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,399
talking about so previous research his
arm

197
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,389
first one a is the from ex-con
conference

198
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:28,880
in 2005 next the wasn't sys-con

199
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,570
the most comprehensive in my opinion
from target amount

200
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,269
and new storm had black cat

201
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,610
up actually you know I am

202
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,209
really curious cuz the I'll

203
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,139
each research he's a focused on takin
poor care itself

204
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,940
and from for example after the gym and

205
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,320
at the black hat DC a talked about

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,560
some cool flaws about

207
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,920
cool attacks versus alligator on when a
cell phone

208
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,160
a Microsoft the

209
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,860
skew the engineers from Microsoft to I
think and the

210
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,670
a rather is his lies and the just simply

211
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,980
donated all his techniques and the

212
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,199
in the 2012

213
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,959
a he discovered to just two more
techniques

214
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,990
so well okay it will cater is

215
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,300
to really at the moment kind of
bullet-proof

216
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,839
so talking about so /url days

217
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,490
be for Windows cell it was in 2008

218
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,940
arm now

219
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,970
researcher made by Costa Koschitzke was
about so

220
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,639
creating fake entries and the it will

221
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,220
it leads to um right for primitive

222
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,339
alright a pretty feet when you control

223
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,779
I'll pointer and when you control data

224
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:05,310
so there is a a several scenarios

225
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,839
I just a shoal I'll while

226
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,560
so basically returned the it based on
the

227
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,899
how on entry a is a

228
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,149
removed from double single double link
least

229
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,319
so if you control a some

230
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,630
are entry it turns that

231
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,920
the you control a

232
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,329
overwrites the up for our rights or
memory so basically in Carroll

233
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:37,079
it's a results in the compromise

234
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,209
so this is an example of

235
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,660
for exploiting using fake entry

236
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,750
so on is there is a chunk

237
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,750
as there is a or fall there is a next
batter and we

238
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,500
change a Heather love

239
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,230
next chunk a which H for example precise

240
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,459
or block size and it's a results that

241
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,990
pool or Gator thinks that there is a

242
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,060
also fake header which

243
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,819
actually our we constructors

244
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:15,190
and them it turns that the when

245
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,730
next header was freed there is a merch
and the

246
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,980
we gets a right for primitive soul

247
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,709
again alright so arbitrary memory which
is

248
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,490
for more much so all

249
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,630
this is the the techniques you know

250
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,940
thereabouts a variations of for that
technique

251
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,610
and in Windows 7 a.m. I

252
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,040
this technique was partially eliminated

253
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,440
cause though you know some in with a7
Microsoft the

254
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,569
implemented the safe safe and Lincoln

255
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:58,610
so on in 2012

256
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,759
in 2011 tab the

257
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,279
discovered the that Microsoft to
implement the

258
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,579
say on Lincoln in not so secure way

259
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,589
as our

260
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:15,810
about five techniques for example least

261
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,319
entry I think alright so he discover
that

262
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,730
Microsoft the checks to only the

263
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,149
back work link so if you control forward
link

264
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:30,180
it leads to a retard

265
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,430
bull alright next the there I'll

266
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,649
some techniques from him but the I

267
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,459
mean I'm not gonna describe them

268
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,129
I'll you can know check with his lights
a

269
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,410
I wanna say that I all this

270
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,959
the takes the

271
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,589
leads to who write for primitive and the

272
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,690
they attack pool allocator now they

273
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,819
soul for example pull index alright

274
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,579
there is a technique to overwrite index
and

275
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,670
it leads to who index

276
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,810
out of bounds condition and the

277
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,970
I and the right for primitive in them

278
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,319
so or I'll Microsoft the

279
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,510
sturdy engine for myself have done a
really great job in with the state's

280
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,520
a lot of medications and the

281
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,480
they basically I I I hope the rates the

282
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,890
he slides and the dominated all

283
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,340
various techniques soul ivory

284
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,950
will made a great job on on when the
state

285
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,850
and discovered the just to

286
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,159
a little bit more techniques a for
example books I

287
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,549
attack he if we have a

288
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,190
were built in I where is a

289
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,770
we control are or phone data

290
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,130
very precisely weekend a over writes
books I S

291
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,860
to bigger value for example

292
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,740
and as I told before

293
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,730
there is some are Patrik if for

294
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,679
a we overwrites a

295
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,130
Juncker at the bottom of the page

296
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,980
were there are no check so far some meta
data

297
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,120
for example block says in process so

298
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,610
basically I can't show it on graphical
mode

299
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,630
so for example with helpful for chunks
that the

300
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,789
a few the page in the there is a

301
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,150
overflow we change to a block size

302
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,360
of channel cat or the to feel it

303
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,250
to the rest of the page and free so
basically

304
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,520
a we full-bore caterer that the

305
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,270
you think that there is no junk here

306
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,640
and the when we allocates bigger size

307
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,909
it returns bigger chunk and

308
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:09,140
for example we can now

309
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,590
rail kids this freed memory

310
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,210
this freed memory by a some think which
is the control like Unicode strings

311
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,750
and the it turns that the

312
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,030
we on the right content on of this junk

313
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:31,510
so basically a it leads to arbitrary
memory corruption

314
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,610
so

315
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,990
or why I you know talking fear cuz

316
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,350
a to attack pearl girl pool cater

317
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,620
with for example this technique by the
way a split jump attack its kinda far

318
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,940
operation of workplace attack so I just

319
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,710
keep to exploit the

320
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,730
such water bill to say you kept for to
have

321
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,929
own almost full control over over or
form data

322
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,059
and the my experience the shows that
there are a lot of fuller built this

323
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,299
when you haven't control

324
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:14,309
overflown day 20 hours or phone the date
is constant

325
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:18,110
so you haven't the chance to construct

326
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,470
fake pool header with bigger what size

327
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,500
so it doesn't work simply and the

328
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,640
basically all research a

329
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,210
against to about so exportation
corruptions

330
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,630
is about and described in some trick
simple occasion

331
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,470
in pool a catering or get a mechanism
and so on

332
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,809
so and will on will say the

333
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,020
its so very hard to exploit somewhere
about this

334
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,940
up in a reliable way

335
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,039
so you know I sector

336
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,330
well I built this Paul corruptions into

337
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,679
group which %uh sweet have though

338
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,350
which you can exploit using public
techniques like of

339
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,000
our geo a X were ordinance by Coaster

340
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,270
and the there of course liabilities and
the you haven't these

341
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,520
simply haven't chance to exploit
hardcore liability issues and public to

342
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,179
fix

343
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,690
so just examples a

344
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,559
I have a lil discovered what the
flywheel with

345
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,640
a this types when you

346
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,820
hair when other phone date that use a is
uncontrolled

347
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,659
always there is a man set with zeros
always some constant

348
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,900
and there is no way to construct a

349
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,740
fake Heather no correct way to

350
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,500
apply some Eliza public techniques

351
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,750
so a I was thinking about a

352
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,669
up I imagine the situation what if

353
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,909
pool a caterer is bulletproof what if

354
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,120
there is no attacks there is no
technique against me they did

355
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,650
soul is the what if pimple a killer is
totally bulletproof

356
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,029
a basically as this technique

357
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:19,940
came from musical and cause a inures
length

358
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,740
a nowadays up

359
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,710
exploit writers use contents of matter
for example

360
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,870
how you know how experts writers bypass

361
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,760
as a lot of these days they use object
soul the

362
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,820
alright content of some more

363
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,830
a Joe Street and so on object

364
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,610
and them I was the researching

365
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,480
a so what we can know over right and
girl

366
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,299
of course Carol has objects

367
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,669
for example a registry objects

368
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:02,750
file objects hope to see LBC semaphore
or get there are a lot of types

369
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,279
soul to describe objects thereof
heather's

370
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,610
and there is a object manager in Windows
which is kind of

371
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,279
a big part of

372
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,400
Windows kernel itself and the

373
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,409
basically this technique

374
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,779
is based on the that ok gonna object
manipulation which is a

375
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,140
most which is known a for a long time

376
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,669
but enroute get world not the
exportation

377
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,820
so actually I'll I'm curious why I at
the moment

378
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,059
there is a no researcher

379
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,270
use in Ruth keep the techniques

380
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,140
exportation you so

381
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,630
there's a definition of object feather
from wrk

382
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,220
a to show you

383
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,700
the most interesting ones so there are
types

384
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,240
of objects so basically when you
allocate colonel objects

385
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,429
a after chunk color so after

386
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:11,659
meta-data before or Gator

387
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:15,789
there is a object feather and the after
with a camera there's a

388
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,330
body soul actual contents objects

389
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,510
this structure on a

390
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,880
changed a little bit in the since who
since the Windows Vista

391
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
but the in it just the

392
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,000
there is a pointer to type and on when
the state on when the Swiss tunnel in

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,750
the seventh

394
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,279
there's index to array of object types

395
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,390
elements soul

396
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,429
object that describes the some

397
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,929
things in but the most interesting one
is a object type in

398
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:52,929
so either structure which Colts

399
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,570
pointers and yep I just to

400
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,159
shoulder that on different

401
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,059
operating systems a basically

402
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,710
object manager lemme is the same

403
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,120
since nter for to Windows

404
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,649
8 a I mean up algorithms

405
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:18,529
there are a lot of new objects in the
Windows we stand with a seven on this

406
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:22,940
8 but algorithms structures a pretty
thing

407
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,309
they're just a little the changers doing

408
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:32,929
US two versions so object type in towers
or structure holds the

409
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,230
for point to restore procedures for
example

410
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,750
for open object for deleting object for

411
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,960
arson blah blah blah there is a example

412
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,220
just the looks thing

413
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,350
will sing there is though

414
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,179
example of LPC object-type

415
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,470
so there was a pointers to some up
functions like

416
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,250
open so they were so is a LPC open court

417
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,570
course person or is that helps EcoSport
saw

418
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,039
soul the fun if think that

419
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,559
array that the holds a

420
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,830
pointers to object-type elements

421
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,070
a starts from from the third

422
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,470
soul first element in second element

423
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,110
are kinda for kind of magic

424
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,770
first element is zero and second element
is

425
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,880
the has value battle Bob or which is in
my magic

426
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,520
value and Simone and the

427
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,620
on the 64-bit severin system

428
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,620
in this constant I'll

429
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,929
extended by 0th so

430
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,169
on 64-bit operating system a

431
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:57,390
second element resides in other in use
in length

432
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,470
address space so

433
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,840
what though how we can though

434
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,659
use it in a exportation a

435
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,350
we can smash a cat or goal special
siskel which

436
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,980
triggers actually the some other brought
to the worst

437
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,990
and this leads to a check of
control-flow so

438
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,159
we gain just control of the IP or
alright be raised

439
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,260
so on in steps first of all the spray
Paul

440
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,360
with objects depending on what

441
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,919
liable to exploit for example if it's
not paged

442
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,080
pool we spray a objects that

443
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,720
allocated in non paged page that we use
subject that

444
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,440
allocated in baseball them we fragment

445
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,600
also my fashion for ensuring pool

446
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,049
and basically we make Kohls

447
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,750
at the bottom of the page it's the to
predict

448
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,390
where allocation will take place then
would trigger

449
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,970
actually wear a built-in overflow
corruption

450
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,419
because the we make calls at the bottom
of the page when the

451
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:12,090
overflown chunk is free as there will be
no

452
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,659
blue sky above this because there are no
checks matter they a

453
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,779
so we can I'll free overflown

454
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,039
chunk and the work next

455
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,019
goal see schools whatever

456
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:30,870
so basically is there are a lot of
brought to the worst lycopene damp cloth

457
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,320
a query security blah blah but funny
thing

458
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,720
the I I discovered that the

459
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,380
there is a1 special system call 'cause

460
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,730
in the name is there is a security
antique where security objects

461
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,840
but they in fact it turns that

462
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,070
we gain control or yeah I

463
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,169
the register so its not so secure

464
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,260
basically when we overflow

465
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,899
mile object petr a and

466
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:06,370
next the call was this the system call

467
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,700
a after or object reference arms back
and all we get the

468
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,779
memory up for pointer to member where's
the

469
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:18,330
object located Gaza heather is a

470
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,789
well is located at before objects over
there is a minus

471
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:27,570
a syriza your ox actually it's so

472
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,740
type in the KSA well you than that
irreverence

473
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,649
and in them we get goal PDX

474
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:39,200
so we get so control of the AP

475
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,309
or every

476
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:47,870
so all these techniques are based on the

477
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:53,120
these are a as a the real wholesome

478
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,269
information about all colonel ok object
types

479
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,740
so and in this raises there are some
interest in

480
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,399
things a

481
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,559
basically index is a one bite but

482
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,010
the if you can

483
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,750
the see a there are

484
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,690
object that's and the there's a rate

485
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,919
if the have 0l

486
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,000
so if you ever fall a type

487
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,159
index with a some more value which is a

488
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,140
out of bounds history you can get no
pointer dereference

489
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,720
and the by calling

490
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,730
antiquary security object few game

491
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,860
control education for

492
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,130
but the thing is is as you know

493
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,340
um the on when the seven you can

494
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,130
to a gate when the 8 so this technique

495
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,059
use and out of bounds season i0

496
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,580
the no values it works the

497
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,789
you when those 8 bout actually

498
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:12,130
I a wall i woke up today

499
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,590
and the feature that

500
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,250
Microsoft up back porch at the

501
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,990
this restriction from Windows 8 to when
the cell

502
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,600
so basically the Microsoft

503
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,799
eliminated this technique but

504
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,840
I'm not mad actually because there is a
special

505
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,039
value which is bad mobile and

506
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,230
it allocates its a at second

507
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,429
a value in array

508
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,710
I'll basically this the magic constant

509
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,980
the a is a from

510
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,210
nt4 to you leaked version on the win

511
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,460
of Windows Mobile I'll check to a leaked
version a kernel of

512
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,100
who leaked version of Windows blue and
this code is still there

513
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,559
so actually I don't know why Microsoft
chose

514
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,110
this constant Gaza

515
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:15,190
it you can spray a memory

516
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,690
a to achieve this address

517
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,340
I'll I don't know why and the

518
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,700
be on 64-bit operating system

519
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,059
a station is even worse cause a

520
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,070
this constant extend by zeros and you
simply can

521
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,370
allocates a memory a allocates a

522
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,029
news 11th the make fake object-type

523
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:46,269
entry and gain in the kitchen but on the
other hand so

524
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:50,789
I hope for Microsoft will implement SMAP
in Windows blue

525
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,679
as a maybe we'll dominates this
technique on 64-bit

526
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,690
but on 32 bits a its

527
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,830
it will still work Gaza as a maybe your

528
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,490
will not help if for memory

529
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,580
is girl

530
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,970
so was just the disaster

531
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,370
of form a function

532
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,789
so basically there is 0 just one
percocet

533
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,200
to apply this technique you have to care
for

534
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,610
value 1 you know overflown data

535
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,070
and the you smash a type index with

536
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,350
value what one which is kinda special
mobile war

537
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,559
a spray memory and gain called call the
key

538
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,620
execution soul

539
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,100
what the floor the you haven't

540
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,250
the spelling in the our phone data

541
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,429
a soul you have to

542
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:55,809
find some another solution and the

543
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:58,929
for example security person there's a

544
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,639
of the different objects a are different

545
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,740
so for example for file to you're the
person they were

546
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,510
is a I O get security object I'll

547
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,600
of the registry its S&P secured emailed

548
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,049
and the basically we can fall

549
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,990
colonel a we can on the right a

550
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,649
type index of or register key to file

551
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:29,040
and this will lead to some more

552
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,790
were built this some of my more
corruptions you know

553
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,510
liggett made goat soul because the seen
be secured a method to

554
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,730
thinks that the dispatched

555
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,920
register object but we can the

556
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,890
for sure they're fake up

557
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:53,080
and Zam soul object-type confusion

558
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,830
we can a change type and they they've
gone all reject

559
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,390
this will lead the to rate reflect the
food you should fall

560
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,310
and the we can chief right for primitive

561
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,570
but the object that confusion over

562
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,930
has protested that the to achieve that
would have a

563
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,160
a good control over our phone date
because the

564
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,410
a in the functions that dispatched

565
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,530
kernel of truth gonna objects it IOC

566
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,910
you know big structures with the with
the

567
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,550
a lot the fields and the in some station

568
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:34,160
if for example you for we smash some
more

569
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,010
fields object with zeros there will be a
opens a reference and there will be

570
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,310
the skin of this so its kinda

571
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,430
for heart technique to implement so

572
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,700
basically

573
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,160
Microsoft the you know totally forgot
about

574
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,170
not the lexer I michaelson Kansas

575
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,420
who whatever mechanisms but totally
forgot about object mounger

576
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,940
object had the worst and there is there
is no

577
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,000
you know security checks there is no

578
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,660
kooky an object Heather but the you know

579
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,240
the gonna for SMAP will

580
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,690
eliminates all these techniques but the
actually

581
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,580
I think that even implementing cookin
object rather

582
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,050
will not change situation a lot

583
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,230
Gaza if we in

584
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,810
if we take a look at I'll IRS apply rest

585
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,550
or Linux there I'll

586
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,550
exploits writers you several are built
this for example

587
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,630
information leakage to leaker well your
fukin them

588
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,910
implements all the techniques so but

589
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,390
basically Microsoft should implement
cooking to

590
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,180
to eliminate the these very

591
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,770
is the techniques so

592
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,400
any questions

593
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,170
anyone have any questions for me

594
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,999
it's scary to be the first question such
still

595
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:20,660
that structure love I'll

596
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,339
objects allocated and chunks the
together with their constructor

597
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:25,140
destructor

598
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,380
this is essentially the came am what
this level I cater

599
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,569
rate wall kind of

600
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:36,549
its so to you know Linux has that

601
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:39,640
Solaris has that Solaris has I'll

602
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,130
has a look though that because they're
sort the object-oriented colonel

603
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,089
so would you say that the entire idea of
storing

604
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,599
objects with a review tables and you
know

605
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,180
hopes methods is a bad thing yeah well

606
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,969
actually I haven't tested but this idea
should work on

607
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:02,619
every operating system rates as a there
are there a

608
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,190
over I think almost a operating system
uses colonel objects

609
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,200
so but it depends on some tricks cuz

610
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,400
to apply the meaning a

611
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,199
do not trigger blue screen was there is
a

612
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:21,329
tree in the when this girl

613
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:24,900
we have to makeup of

614
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,449
whole to predictor the delegation will
take place at the bottom up

615
00:38:28,449 --> 00:38:31,869
so if we a so for sure

616
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,619
if we construct the the page in such
ways that

617
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,619
allocation will take place a in the
middle or

618
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,719
in the top there'll be blue screen

619
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,559
so actually you know this

620
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:48,559
idea should work on ever represent
system but the

621
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,199
implementation a you know depends on

622
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,829
allocator mechanisms of free operating
system

623
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,880
rate but gingerly your I mean I i
interpret your

624
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,900
fix recommendation as saying out with
ever you allocate

625
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,509
objects %ah up put in some extra context

626
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:10,609
just like keys

627
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,989
yep theaters or anything like that
without that

628
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:17,640
any slept these memory allocation iniki
ma'am

629
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,380
%um memory allocation would be
susceptible to this

630
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,999
so I'll what the question sir

631
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:29,239
I mean will cookies help

632
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,619
were inge just a little bit

633
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:35,729
well you know

634
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:40,289
if you Sat basically I have another

635
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,890
you know receipt to

636
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,029
change this value but both to something

637
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:51,479
like on the top of other space like F up

638
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:55,339
because they're basically if you take a
look of book contents

639
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:58,559
of for disarray a

640
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,039
there are zeros so 08

641
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,670
zeros you can't alligator no page

642
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,989
on Windows 8 and if Microsoft changes

643
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:14,640
Bobo constant it will this idea WBU

644
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,769
die so but the cookie will help a little
bit

645
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:24,319
in my opinion but a and

646
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,559
Microsoft should do a change this
magical

647
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:33,670
thank you

648
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:39,230
