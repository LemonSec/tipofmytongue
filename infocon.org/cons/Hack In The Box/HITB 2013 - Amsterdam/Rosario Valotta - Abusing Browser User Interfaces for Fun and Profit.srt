00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,300
Magnavox answer now and easy as topic he
is a

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,300
abusing brothers user interfaces for fun
and profit as you can guess from

9
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,570
toss title we going to discuss someone a
piece about

10
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,780
crossing pieces I'm gonna show you a
couple tweaks that

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,530
an attacker can use I in order to
compromise security

12
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,550
and also get code execution which with a
little bit of us on engineering

13
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,750
before diving into a technical details
just a few hours

14
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,750
advantages myself I come from Rome

15
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,750
to me where I work as a up part

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,770
managing them by technician company so
this is my daily job back in my spare

17
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,890
time which is mostly

18
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,300
nighttime I like practicing web security

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,729
higher I'm acting in this film since Nov
2007 I released by Scott by syriza

20
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,550
provoke concept about techniques you sum
up you are the mock

21
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,770
checking up pops was I to your user two
years ago yeah and I think the box

22
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,410
or my time partner which is a new heart
now

23
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,440
members a partner with that deep-set
conference again a few months ago

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,440
I want but you don't lose my P's work

25
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,020
if you're interested you can check them
out my website okay

26
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,380
are less are our discussion talking
about social engineer mahler

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,990
I we don't end up mom were spread he's
the one of the most compelling

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,620
problem that web security team to say
yes to peace nominees

29
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,720
most fred is increasing year-over-year
and according to some reports provided

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,110
by

31
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,349
Kaspersky Lab's owning 2012

32
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,540
up Morgan 200 town some

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,560
you more samples were spotted every new
me and is that too

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,560
more than one how be in your own small
where

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,930
talk sorry made by two out from the web
but most interesting thing

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,650
is that and the most bizarre talks where
originated by using incident on what

37
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,960
so we are 20 talking are more than one
billion users

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,580
at proctor you don't know some
executable files their computers

39
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,910
above click on them and get back to so
when when talking about

40
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,140
user security is quite obvious that you
can't rely on user

41
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,000
consciousness when user awareness
because Giffords user is completely

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,820
I where on what he's doing what sucking
that you just need got Houston

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,810
protection while surfing the internet
and we can deliver these things by

44
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,660
providing

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,970
trust them a reliable security menace
that's why

46
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,440
the latest years browser vendors
investors I love my and networks

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,230
into building some I'll reliable
security mechanism and

48
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,430
in making the existing one more robust
and a

49
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,590
development in more in poor man and yes

50
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,650
the first happy picture against memory
corruption exports

51
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,090
and so in a novel technologies like
cancel our nap

52
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,830
GS house one can make exploit writers
like

53
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,890
are ok secondary ice protection on the

54
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,610
from what the tax so here cross-site
scripting

55
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,920
keep checking endured knowledge is names
are exercise you first

56
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,980
and better for Cincy and i can text for
all

57
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,449
or RT frame technologies or something
the spring your

58
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,489
you supporting nominee by or mainstream
rock

59
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,960
unit area is not protection against her

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,990
mahler and she and your that technology
is developing our smart

61
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,190
for Microsoft RC browse Safe Browsing
API Google

62
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,210
and last accompanies at local back for

63
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,130
has been positive into building some
trust them the recognizable

64
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,440
user interfaces to out user make

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,210
work choices while surfing the internet
saw

66
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,610
when talking about trust americanize
more using

67
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,650
fees we are talking about crawl just a
car 5 40 you

68
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,840
at don't know we're not talking about
Google Chrome browser

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,080
we're talking about from house up

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,889
on this at some user controls interfaces
a pop-up menus navigation bar smartphone

71
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,520
whatever

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,919
that provide and interface

73
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,319
that's around what content and provides
an interface between user

74
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,110
and Brock saw to say it with a couple
slides

75
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,349
business call and this conference

76
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:25,080
okay it's not always obvious

77
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,789
this thing with chrome from conference
persons is a screenshot

78
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:33,270
taken from talk got the picture in
picture attack at first class and

79
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,550
in the special you stop easy to
distinguish are

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,669
wrong which is the 10th one from you
know chrome

81
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:43,650
which is just and meet have this is of
course

82
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,139
phishing attack in which the company's
speaking using

83
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,849
into pinpoint is people credentialing to
this tax form

84
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:54,199
by eventually delivering use
professional not to

85
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,430
people that come to mind but to people
that lived in the congo mean whatever

86
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,180
NIS

87
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,419
but picture in picture as not being the
only attack targeting web a

88
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,779
brother user interfaces into this year's
and other

89
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,849
quite popular talk was your physician
this talk to expose

90
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,150
this iPhone browser in the car not a
mall to a

91
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,749
reliably render the euro in part by User
a

92
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:23,389
generally speaking and URL can and then
some for national

93
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,599
and sore DeGennaro Potter years then

94
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,300
each he User Name column passport damn

95
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,439
where possible is an optional so

96
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,099
when it team is stricken into following
URL like this

97
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,689
there's basically to get between the
user perception of your help

98
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,449
and the process arson euro so user is
led to believe he's going to Music Bank

99
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,330
of America

100
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,930
call why I Tony after parsing the
browser

101
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,550
are our salsa you some to that I keep

102
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,460
am this was a gold mine for fishers

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,029
I and his Bach was still present on our

104
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,309
a few years ago on in their lives
personal question

105
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:09,509
for since opposite party and and noms

106
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,599
and Firefox raise a warning by asking
the user are you sure it is that you

107
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,279
want to visit

108
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,189
or maybe even picked a more efficient
interns for

109
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,360
to ca more cross approach by completely
singer

110
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,379
and your honor solution for your honor
been better

111
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,180
credentials and chrome cannot approach

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,599
yet renders page and sweeps provincial
from the kitchen bar so keeping the user

113
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,740
a clear perception of the two main is

114
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,839
inadequate dentures attack is up
download outspoken attack

115
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,389
as the name itself suggests is a
sporting a talk against

116
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,800
hide all morning next vacation and
basically

117
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,949
it's no use more of the following: you
be set up a website

118
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,369
talk website immune response in
unification window

119
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:58,469
to intervene and web site in this case I
can be

120
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,960
at after death yeah website changes

121
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,339
your hair minden unity so no URL

122
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,819
so what's the URL servant with companies
shot placement either

123
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,069
manse that we are starting you don't law

124
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,569
and are SOL is that I downloading

125
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,770
is from our appears in the context of
the navigation window

126
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,029
and so it is is like user to believe
that

127
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,650
that the Lord is originated by awesome
website

128
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,889
only after a careful inspection you
cannot actually

129
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,539
and not use to the reason a match
between

130
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,560
the navigation to main and during making
the may not be the law

131
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,810
but not every browser alone you to do
this

132
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,110
on threats for persons and chrome and
firefox

133
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,220
are you Makkah is understandable test

134
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,680
so this field engines and still works on
inference for a9

135
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,260
from $10.5 part absentia it s been
petting the latest version of contracts

136
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,899
for

137
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,350
so from these got some possibly quite
clear that

138
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,560
up prosecutions are really important

139
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,890
very important for several reasons use
the

140
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,360
dark it's all part of the process
fastball may notify users before making

141
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,970
important choice

142
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,540
and the acts as a communication medium
between the brosser

143
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,790
and using so they need to be recognized
on trial

144
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,140
so not not he's responsible

145
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,850
nowadays a to kinda are

146
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,890
security institutions system all across

147
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,430
model notifications and models missions
modifications are

148
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,180
are classy dialogues that of in the
middle of the screen

149
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,620
asking you to make some decisions a

150
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,940
get back to rise by strong conference in
order to get your attention

151
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,460
and they are more cockblocking so
whatever team you are doing you have to

152
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,680
interrupt you know you shop

153
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,820
am dismissed the doc first

154
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,700
they can you rejected by US or by cross
when rejected by yes the usually

155
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,080
up deals with some important
notification by US persons user access

156
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,730
conforming

157
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,430
stations when regions by the browser
became the

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,310
weekends are all scenarios persons
fifty-some from the website

distance from the browser's and
something has they can be very annoying

161
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,910
and forth answer problem because in
order to dismiss them as quickly as

162
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,660

315
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,410
directly on the notification bar so you
don't need anymore the top key

316
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,970
because the palms is already in the
institution bar means that

317
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,750
you can't forget code execution by just
taking one keep and

318
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,280
you can be archaeon you you keep and

319
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,730
on US language or space or and I

320
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,710

325
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:06,099
don't seem to work

326
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,420
artist start

327
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,170
okay

328
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:20,170
saw up passing all

329
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,810
what happened

330
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,309
was

331
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:35,309
I and the mall system

332
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,690
are K

333
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:47,690
as pop over to keep up

334
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,250

presentation

336
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,870
a of course you have I always and you
can use in order to trick your victim to

337
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,950
to type when he I mean a game help chai

338
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,750
impasse up so up

339

are their limitations for dinner talk to
me and what kinda makes you beautiful

340
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,970
can you launch with the stock yes there
are a couple of invention

341
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,360
first is mocking tutor second easy user
access control

342
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,960
as most consistent asking for is one of
the colleges

343
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,060
of my brother are about christmas
banners

344
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,140
Notre to block access to all malicious
files and malicious URL

345
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,740
before nothing to come from a actual

346
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,950
arm such a point of view their Meetup

347
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,350
talk two parts on the server side threes

348
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,760
clower addition basin system that's
course the web for finding

349
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,210
malicious files might use URL at

350
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:59,650
categorized am and assign it to them I
ranking

351
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,200
guys drinking guy is the ranking the
IRA's up

352
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,690
the safety of policy am

353
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,890
on this on the client side the reason
brother agents at

354
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,650
anytime you dole all 5 from the web ask
on some

355
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,600
repetition information from the to the
club Sestak I mean

356
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,690
this fine use your or or are

357
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,740
cropping or in smaller and receives

358
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,110
feedbacks from our plow at in for some
warning about

359
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,000
conference on the client side up there
are two basic

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,250
implementations of these two parties on
one side safe browsing:

361
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,840
by Google and is also used on Firefox an
awesome party

362
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,240
is based on a glossy browsing at the IRS
into

363
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,280
and it supports your organization so

364
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,330
every URL use prior we r withering

365
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,720
and I chrome also support I i think is
for

366
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,560
Shin must computer me morass same thing
but

367
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,900
is based on Microsoft quite a resolution
it wasn't for the city enough Internet

368
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,770
Explorer 8

369
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:09,670
and starting we do I threats or nine
also support application repetition at

370
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,880
week at the International Windows be
stopped windows I ate sorry

371
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,640
and smart screen has been extended
system-wide

372
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,860
these me of that as mark can check

373
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,130
would be not only performing when you
don't want haha brosser

374
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,300
whenever you put appalling your computer
using a your

375
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,260
yes the heezy wrong whatever at first
Tron as marking

376
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,320
check we do perform a according to these
charts

377
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,440
while by ESAs a laps from

378
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,900
this kind of technology is quite
effective a

379
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,110
so impressed part 10 using us more
screens able to catch

380
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,500
almost one 1 percent of our

381
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,250
mother samples but if you look on the
rocks heart they need some time

382
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,130
in order to catch freshly published at
mom where

383
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,180
because they need to collect now be best
for modeling

384
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,300
just provide am from and user agents

385
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,450
in order to build replication for new
vice

386
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,730
how does moscow it works

387
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,020
basically when you are opening where you
are opening you find them on from the

388
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,520
web

389
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,470
you are providing Summerside your liking
gurl you don't know the

390
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,340
by Paul fine ash by naming coming basics

391
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,890
for at the signs me available all of
that

392
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,220
and quality not pick some up for and
what his response

393
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,190
response he's a and execution morrow
ranging now

394
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,300
one of these three cases first is about
I S exit the check

395
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,920
so must be asking you you want Ron say
more can sell discount if I

396
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,970
up the second case is about publicly
said the file

397
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,540
so we are actually trying to open among
your and so

398
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,790
the as mark cream prevents you from
opening from clicking around bop

399
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,980
yeah he lost his keys is about or a
petition check

400
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,240
pain this man's I'm not sure

401
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
you doubt because you're trying to open
his mom where are not about being in top

402
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,060
I will disable the wrong button if you
want to run capped first connections and

403
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,020
then click on rock

404
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,460
the park or changes according to

405
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,560
the Chickasaw and Sangha certificate I
mean

406
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,390
in first grade application we're trying
to open what's I am the park or were

407
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,540
green and yellow

408
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,410
in the last days was Yellin of crap but
there are a number of ways

409
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:33,210
you can use to work rounds marceca for
small

410
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,800
well repetition check professional-grade
is not 100 percent for libel

411
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,580
on the website is calm and are now does
not come

412
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,050
it's a moment I just provide website up

413
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,070
it provides a huge least are next week's

414
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,520
and next week is basically shortened URL

415
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,750
and linking to some more distribution
all over Twitter

416
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,290
upon the almost I

417
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,480
percent samples for letting in disney's
went goat

418
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,590
was mostly even me classified

419
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,820
as mom where or out where my first of
all persons more

420
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,860
a as I said before some response

421
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,140
some sometime is needed for our or

422
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,880
this the college's to catch numerous
samples

423
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,250
so if you watch him over you have
goodness chance of passing is more speed

424
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:24,810
in the field

425
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,800
opportunities good way to my boss

426
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,450
Mar screen he's dealing about concerning
a

427
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,980
Microsoft strongly up Inc or just

428
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,460
brought and of course in Belfast to sign

429
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,030
their vacation using an authentic on
consigning

430
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,520
and you can buy and I'll ankles here

431
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,880
as such a case like this on go that the

432
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,330
model semantic whatever will cost $150
your for your

433
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,680
they will sell you one without asking
too many questions and

434
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,820
do resign for pushing consigning is that

435
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,670
the the repetition arboretum

436
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,490
we provide and I a ranking to
application sign in with trust

437
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,250
uncertainty

438
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,380
up not there are a couple of considers
from us

439
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,040
first call up

440
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,750
signing the an application with Suzuki
with you might not know harder assurance

441
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,180
about the fact application your opening
or using his mother or not

442
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,620
because consigning you just making to
mind

443
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,090
up a physical identity the publisher and
each time I that's the

444
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,230
certificate saw from technical point of
view

445
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,540
you can use attracts sticky to sign some
are more

446
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,410
and distributed and these will work with
SmartScreen

447
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,580
because when dealing with sign up
applications dealer condition ongoing

448
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,260
will only look and the certificates ID
reputation

449
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,700
and not to the application instance saw

450
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,780
if you are able to put your hands on or
to steal

451
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,400
first city am uses the same your
homework

452
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,510
he will go to his mommy or

453
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,680
you'll at not the chance you look hot
and sticky

454
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,500
you can go on semantic already served
and they will sell a brand-new

455
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,180
up certificate type is called extend the
politicians have to be

456
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,400
and if you might wanna be's and sign
your pic is from want this if it's up to

457
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,020
the key

458
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,110
if we grant an immediate immediately a
good reputation

459
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,110
for your application even equal priority
addition exist

460
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,390
saw still across the St 0 at

461
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,480
atrocity on by use get like this

462
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,110
pathway you can use in order to bypass
completely bypassed my screen

463
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,330
isn't dealing with internet connection I
mean

464
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,540
it's a client/server technology so up
girls our age in

465
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,350
mean internet connection and to connect
with her Summerside

466
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,670
saw in a man in the middle scenario

467
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,180
a and a talker camp set-top free access
points

468
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,630
three keys victim to connect that assets
point these

469
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,800
is web page don't want someone we're
using the

470
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,270
once you talk home for ap at that point

471
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,120
this mosque in a gym will try to connect
with Mike Microsoft nor

472
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,320
to check reputation for application but

473
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,540
yet I can I check any connection and
broadband connection Microsoft

474
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,670
and what is the result their sockets and
unification more

475
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:36,140
complaining about the hot he's not able
to verify the identity of that Mexican

476
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,679
but still allowing you to click on the
run tomorrow

477
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,890
saw if you are able to secure victory
too tight

478
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:45,980
you are key once again

479
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,030
your DAW and this time it's not all

480
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:53,190
Norma on execution his cock nixon's

481
00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:00,190
let's do that the search

482
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:08,970
all possible

483
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:17,660
okay and let's talk in my connection

484
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,180
and back to local East End Sub Pop
concept me

485
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,190
that

486
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:38,190
what's up doc extract key sequence
arbitrary code execution

487
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,610
when I think is basically I don't wanna
a batch file

488
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,830
asking to make a aw

489
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,700
directory missing and popping up popping
up

490
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,390
ok okay

491
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:02,260
on being compact

492
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,299
and other industries a user access
control

493
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,559
this is a security mechanism into using
the nom

494
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,620
we must be stopped have basically
officer

495
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,669
at dialogue asking you for confirmation

496
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,950
where application that uses I'll as some
using

497
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,620
is asking for administrative privileges
you can buy up

498
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,780
but it was in his do you really need
admissible villages in order to cause

499
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,340
serious damage to your big day

500
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,039
of course the answer is No just think
I'll a

501
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,409
use our cover that on my world mom worst
completely running in the Sunland mall

502
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,890
they do content to Jackson keystrokes
anything and so on

503
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,549
so at the end of the day maastricht
filter

504
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:50,610
is not a problem and user has come for
is not a problem

505
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:54,049
and so using you there cannot talk you
can get a

506
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:59,490
almost armed reconnaissance mission I'll

507
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,909
attack number two attack number two here
and elsewhere to a dynamic window overly

508
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:09,150
works on our Windows 8 and on our book
wrong

509
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,799
interacts or that scenario is more or
less

510
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,120
are the same you be set up like a
website

511
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,850
packed with pride sports on work upon
that goes in the background stars

512
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,520
no longer an excusable fine all of these
are nice up

513
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,980
a given point and I talked the talk to
its addicting

514
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,320
to keep on a given League or bottle and

515
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,990
you can Lee you can track the mall so
position using some javascript

516
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,169
on for growing and assumed miles is
offering

517
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,549
on the link on the bottom you can
immediately suddenly

518
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:45,590
at close for growing any

519
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,890
Chinese appropriate there a good chance
that depicting

520
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,770
click on the underlying we know stand or
chrome attacks like these

521
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,299
have been a rainy the demo my other
secure systems for South

522
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,039
michael's honesty from Google or are
calling Jackson contacts are actually

523
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,590
test bizarre scenario for click checking
whose is not for

524
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,060
find up file our don't know him on

525
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,089
a sample of 2,000 people using the
amazon.com concerns

526
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,830
and found out that their assault their
success rate

527
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,940
obviously talk is more than 90 percent
so it's quite

528
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,460
so why I was still talking about not
bring your talk

529
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,599
because on Windows 8 danger

530
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,169
right but just talk is by far quicker
than wings up

531
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,260
every time you don't know the next a

532
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,800
fine you will find whatever using a
browser US

533
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,190
with rights another file to the park
system

534
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,780
is called on information file it is
basically an alternate data stream is

535
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,440
working on something unforeseen

536
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,839
and carries information about is a cute
song

537
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,930
fine war going on for from saw

538
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,180
internets on impacts on local machine
whatever

539
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,460
on Windows seven when you download a
file

540
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,369
and if I is not be to consign security
dialogue like this

541
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,500
with paw asking you for confirmation
before opening fire

542
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,940
on Windows 8 this kind of control

543
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,550
has been suppressed and smart screen
check we perform

544
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,930
extent but are already short shown you
up to

545
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,720
%uh bypass mocking so this means that in
Windows 8

546
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,890
using his fact I think you can get an
execution much just making one click

547
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,930
lessees in action let's move to Windows
8

548
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,839
called use

549
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:49,839
yes well crap

550
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,180
okay

551
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm I'll I'll

552
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,300
a releasing rock on Sep her me do you
have a photo gallery and one

553
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,490
to create to look at my father's

554
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,210
for this concert from my the holiday
season the Wii my France

555
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,510
I really like it saw I want like am

556
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,640
suddenly I'm thinking somewhere else

557
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,050
you see not shall provide less

558
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,090
businesses among Iraq's a okay

559
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,280
other use cases I'll

560
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,560
joking yup

561
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,380
once again think that you see

562
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,130
I'm I'm listening to the most moments
assume the mouse is over the like model

563
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,310
if I'm not careful

564
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm granting his website that privilege
to know my position

565
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,340
and this thing sorry to I have a

566
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,690
an italian last season dispenser along

567
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,700
I'll a.m. this kind of course

568
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,030
can use in spot nurse nice persons
plugins activations

569
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,930
I except the nation's contracts for

570
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:16,370
and so on average case

571
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,340
and I use keys is I'll

572
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,000
using this kind of talk

573
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,050
as a an alternative click Check

574
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:30,290
you know that some web-sites uses Tom

575
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,890
you some technologies IT training
technologies in order to

576
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,880
prevent to be framed okay for instance
Peter Google

577
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,370
facebook.com some other I know I

578
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,680
if you want to be Jack this kind of up

579
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,870
to me you can use a completely different
we know

580
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,020
not an iframe is another beautiful beach
are mine

581
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,100
and ago talking like packing you see

582
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,700
I'm not careful I'm adding

583
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,870
brand new friend much better now so

584
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:13,060
go back to the presentation has the
final word on what scenario

585
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,340
a joking yes an REO particular

586
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,700
some money some proposal

587
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,140
well modifications

588
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,750
on the back on Windows are useless best

589
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,130
up saw white on that there

590
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,600
notification pops after some second
scenes that

591
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,060
mission we know as we gain boss an
approach like these

592
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,090
at he's already use and in now Firefox

593
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,160
when stalling dos there is a timeout
gonna

594
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,150
from BART use our not available you have
to wait the time

595
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,820
0n that install yup the second

596
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,940
also yes the same thing at tapping you
tomorrow

597
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,480
in my in my opinion my experience top
uses completely

598
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,520
I'll necessary just use mouse if you're
concerned

599
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,140
about access ET a you can steal

600
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,190
in a more and what grants dialect

601
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,710
more accessed artificial market still
enable some

602
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,360
complex he's como in order to

603
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,510
reduced China chance of being such an
engineer at

604
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,940
third some sensitive notifications of

605
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,220
for instance find a long should be

606
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,320
ever be kept in a stock frame-up chrome

607
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,310
I me you're going to find you have
already downloaded file on your computer

608
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,980
a he doesn't really mean to a

609
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,300
to connect is not

610
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,240
from our combines from BART revolution
we go I

611
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,300
just provide the user some ways in order
to inspect your engine for me

612
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,690
then some rosary beads which is

613
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,890
between up we know different domain
should be

614
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,560
always be combined with graphical affect
for suspending blinking light box

615
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,830
noted even at user and

616
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,920
enough reaction time provide them

617
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,350
evidence on 17 and pay attention to the
fact

618
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,480
I'm only on Farrington browser you need
seasons which is

619
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,030
not which is a in addition and something
about using

620
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,250
just think about Twitter forecast

621
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,740
was just keep pager whatsapp code that
was listening to mars Momo

622
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,560
my to my mom okay and side vents which

623
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,580
so a

624
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,020
again we can put up some conclusions

625
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,810
are broza shift from Ottawa syndication

626
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:51,140
is to not matter I implementation are
not secure enough to protect these

627
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,090
safety and show you at least to how
tactics that a lot of course

628
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,270
got remote code execution am so

629
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,060
again the talk while trying to build
complex in our life will exploit

630
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,680
getting cunt execution a simple just
like just person one keep

631
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,730

633
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:23,440
any questions from well

634
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,849
one question about the SmartScreen
Filter I'm

635
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,900
you explain that it works by I'm

636
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,900
checking the hash the file service I and
the cloud service

637
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,309
but how can it know that has profile
without downloading and first

638
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:40,309
sorry I missed and asking if I

639
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,759
i sorry how can the SmartScreen Filter

640
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,009
no that hash file for checking

641
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:51,130
without down on it not I okay

642
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,240
and I'm define is first

643
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,920
though not I when the law is complete

644
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,319
is masking agent with them

645
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,609
all backup information so the filename

646
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,359
eyelash ansel right and then received
feedback

647
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,450
from clout some missus files already on
your computer

648
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:19,450
yeah before this text ok thanks any
other questions

649
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:27,509
on right

650
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,859
SmartScreen Filter checks for and the IP

651
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:35,099
so what if I would host my file a talent

652
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,260
file hosts are for example Dropbox or
something

653
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,060
when it then check the entire URL for
only the domain to see if it is

654
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,599
interested and me where I host my file

655
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,300
does mark grant and check winter ball

656
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,880
will check the URL you don't want the
park for all and their

657
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,270
and application itself I'm not sure I
understand your question does it take

658
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,230
the full URL

659
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,730
are only did them to me so tomorrow on
europe

660
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,000
indicting at again URL because a a few

661
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,359
if you want take first saw some the main

662
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,890
sometime in that Aust while for free and
seen at

663
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,910
Dropbox sense whether you cannot rely on

664
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,910
just for me you have to check the
complete URL questions

665
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,500
Rosario here for the rest of the
conference is once you have any

666
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,819
questions feel free to quote incorrect

667
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,160
thank you very much for Zack
