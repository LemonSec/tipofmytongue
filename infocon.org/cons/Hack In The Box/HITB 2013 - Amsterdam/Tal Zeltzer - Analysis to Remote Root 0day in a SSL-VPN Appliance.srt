1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,690
well

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,690
well

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,540
yes

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,670
alright thank you for coming and today
will cover

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,170
a will basically analyze an SSL VPN
appliances

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,110
will show its internal implementation
services exposed and

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,770
pretty much have to own it so

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,910
a little bit about myself everybody told
me to do a small bio

9
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,460
so must've wanna do is the reverse
engineering

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,000
alive embedded systems and a lot of
development as well

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,570
and they found I also have really enjoy
doing as the research

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,180
I found a few one about this and flash
face and wearing it in our current when

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,040
this briefcase

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,130
and others dat are not public yet

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,770
I have no formal education

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,330
I basically I got a computer when I was
12 and I dropped out of school when I

17
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,149
was 13

18
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:15,530
so yeah

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,299
so a little bit about the research
itself basically started when a friend

20
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,409
of mine called me

21
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,990
and said I'm doing a penetration test
and

22
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,479
I really need to own this company but
they don't have anything

23
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,509
exported the only thing public is the
SSL VPN log

24
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:39,259
so we started doing some research about
this as a sub the plan itself

25
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,890
and as it turns out it had an old phone
a bit the

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,000
actually found by a este console which

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,130
basically allowed you to read arbitrary
files

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,429
from the SSL VPN itself but we weren't

29
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,520
able to actually explain it we weren't
sure if

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,539
the the company itself was patched are
what we're

31
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:04,340
arm we might have been exploring it you
correctly so

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,300
ice I study reading about the appliance
itself

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,069
and I noticed that it has a very chill
addition the virtual addition is

34
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:13,870
basically

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,680
VirtualBox image that you download and
you can run the appliance yourself and

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,000
test that for like a trial so

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
that should be a better solution

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,579
up so a little bit about virtual private
networks

39
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,480
or as I like to call him private
networks this is

40
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,440
a common network diagram that has and
SSL VPN appliance

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,049
as you can see the appliances behind a
firewall and is that it's basically

42
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,260
exposed through the net a user

43
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,660
user login the SSL VPN and then he gets

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,540
access for the lawn servers or whatever
is configured

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,160
on common situation the common situation
is

46
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,590
that you have any any rule from the SSL
VPN appliance

47
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,359
onto the lawn service and when that
happens you can attack

48
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,940
any service you inside Iran want to get
access

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,640
that SSL VPN appliance itself so this is
what we're trying to do

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,739
to get really command execution on the

51
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,730
plants itself so a small not

52
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,090
f5 stated that this

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,680
as a sub EP an appliance is deprecated
they have in Europe

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,690
a new appliance that is a different
architecture everything's different

55
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,730
and this one is supported only for
legacy purposes

56
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,330
so it maybe it's not that very well
sized

57
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,370
did a little bit of digging and I took

58
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,370
I can't name any of the companies that
actually use it but I think the net

59
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:47,930
worth

60
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,780
of three companies and combine it
together

61
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,730
and its 177 billion dollars

62
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,720
so three companies so it's still pretty
valuable

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,220
and their about on over 100 that I found

64
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,330
just going quickly so

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,620
where actually going to analyze the
future in addition

66
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,849
and not the physical appliance South we
can just download it

67
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,180
so little bit about the advantages and
disadvantages

68
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,320
%uh analyzing version VirtualBox virtual
image

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,720
that virtually machine

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,470
actually runs on your instruction set
Iran's yeah great

71
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,979
rounds on x86/x64

72
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,180
because basically you can run it on

73
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,000
other you can emulate other is
architectures as well but

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,280
it's not it's not cost-effective and you
can also

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,450
for example in future nvm where

76
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,150
you can connect to the machine and can
debug

77
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,169
during runtime so it should be pretty
easy to analyze things

78
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,530
and not their child applies and not a
physical one

79
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,860
in addition you also have the factor

80
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,130
of software encryption which which I
mean on physical appliances you may have

81
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,300
dedicated hardware

82
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,440
being used to encrypt the hard drive for
example

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,080
on virtual one you can have that

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,870
because you can't stand sent me any
increase any

85
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,150
dedicated hardware with my download so
it should be a lot easier to analyze

86
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,240
but there are also a couple have
disadvantages as well

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,570
because Seth def maybe

88
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,850
different architecture for example the
physical appliance

89
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,979
miterrand RBC while the virtual one

90
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,039
runs whatever your computer on switches
x86 are 64

91
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,350
so you might have an integer overflow

92
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,630
on x86 but

93
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,250
that that same problem might not occur

94
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,940
on PowerPC because its a different tool
chain it compiles

95
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,860
onto a different by at the different
binary so it doesn't necessarily mean

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,889
that it's the same

97
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,210
and you might have some different
internal implementations

98
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,000
for example a physical appliance might
require

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,870
and drivers that the future one doesn't

100
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,310
it might have different interfaces and
basically

101
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,069
a few slight differences within the
implementation itself

102
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:27,710
you also may have some maintainance
issues where

103
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,120
the physical appliances patched while
the fair trial on isn't

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,650
so it could be a bit more difficult to

105
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,310
match the home the exact my abilities
and we can't develop

106
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,380
any memory corruption exploits mean we
can we could probably

107
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,830
but fast it's a different architecture
and we don't really know the memory

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,690
layout

109
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,050
we can test it we can only get memory
corruption when ability to work

110
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,520
on the future ambition are it might be
possible with a lot over

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,020
reverse engineering to figure out how
exactly it would do behave

112
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,120
on the different instructions at but

113
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,259
it won't be easy so I started out by
just

114
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,380
downloading the vulnerable version like
we said there was there was that an

115
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,389
orphan ability

116
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,310
that allows you to read files from the
applies itself so I want to see if I can

117
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,680
exploit

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,830
I downloaded it alright I get the
download

119
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,960
and it both correctly but apparently you
can't activated

120
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,120
so as as it turns out at five disabled
activation actually

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,229
talk to them on the phone for over an
hour they wouldn't

122
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,590
activated no matter what so

123
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,470
there's no way using the 111

124
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,190
so the only thing that we can do is try
to find your phone abilities

125
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,470
0 days so thats

126
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,490
sounds sounds about right let's try that

127
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,380
I began by mapping the actio attacks FS

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,930
from a black box pissed perspective am

129
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,340
the only open parts where the ATP HTTPS

130
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,250
an SSH get his age is a bit weird as
well because I tried connecting to it

131
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,389
and it failed did to some weird hair

132
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,419
will go over it a bit later and

133
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,530
a family must've the service is exposed
are ATP based sense

134
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,370
this is an SSL VPN everything is
exported overrated

135
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,160
via HTTPS and everything is also

136
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,250
seems to be implemented on PHP in PHP

137
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,740
so this will be our main attack vector
for now

138
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,180
but there is no point in analyzing
everything from a black baptist

139
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,199
perspective because we do have the
physical up

140
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,880
that not the physical to virtual
appliance on our machine

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,310
and we should be able to extract the php
files

142
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,380
examine configurations see if there's
anything else we're missing

143
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,930
some different attack vectors so

144
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,260
we should probably try to extract
everything from

145
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,310
like like I said before virtual machines
can be cannot debug

146
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,000
so basically when you

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,170
like and humor for example when you
enable a feature called the bathtub

148
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,699
you get the more to bind on part 8832

149
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:22,459
and he basically waits for you to be to
connect so you connect to it

150
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,270
and then you can patch bytes and read
bytes and

151
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,199
basically get a shell so I started

152
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:33,990
playing with it little bit and I was
actually able to do a lot of things

153
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,329
but I don't even know the kennel version
so it's gonna take me a bit longer than

154
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:38,810
I'm

155
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,180
would like to spend to actually get a
show man

156
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,310
there's a few the there is another way
that we should be able to do it

157
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,449
a bit more easily so

158
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:53,790
I mounted aksha

159
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,880
fervent virtual machines drive onto a
different operating system

160
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,959
so began examining what they're hard
drive actually contained

161
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,890
so it contained a small book partition

162
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,160
about 67 megabytes and the rest of the
hard drive was complaining cryptic

163
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,839
so the only thing that you can see the
67 megabytes but Asian

164
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,309
it contained a few interesting files it
contained

165
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,500
the encryption key for the rest of the
hard drive the waukee

166
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,220
Duchy DPG it contained hello set up

167
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,329
and contain key PG think that

168
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:35,400
the usually do with these three

169
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,850
is to basically mount being cryptic
drive make it that hard drive

170
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,360
as a loopback device and through GPG

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,439
using I'll set up that way you have
Const

172
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:51,290
and encryption/decryption gateway so you
can access the drive as if it's not

173
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,069
encrypt it

174
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,980
I try to actually do that and mount
banker to drive

175
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,799
and it so for some reason it FB for a
password

176
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,439
I'm not sure it might be it might have
been my mistake but

177
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,339
asking for a password and I don't know
the password

178
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,160
so here's the actual book partition
these are the the three spirits

179
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,270
and you also have the Canon the kernel
version here so

180
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,900
we should be able to go back if we fail

181
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,100
so I decided to actually did bit
differently and

182
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,740
interact with that with the boot system
but the book process

183
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,069
I replaced the hell set up and binary

184
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:34,510
excusable we'd execute about that I
wrote that launches

185
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:41,020
busybox shall so basically what I did
here was to break the decryption process

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,059
the way a way that next time that the
the system with both

187
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,790
once he will try to create the hard
drive it would launch a busy box show

188
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,829
instead

189
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,360
and so it did and a in Review

190
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,980
a move the other set up just we named it
to underscore our setup

191
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,150
so I would still be able to do the
actual decryption

192
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,000
at the same environment as it was
originally suppose to

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,110
happen and

194
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,939
disses the shell that I got when I

195
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,220
when I just replaced it with a is a book
sale

196
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,600
so during a normal boot process you have

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,870
lot of text flying around and I noticed
that one of them was the actual

198
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,220
decryption command as you can see

199
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,970
so month once I was at that is about
shell

200
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,280
I tried to run the exact same comment

201
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,250
and it actually worked it the crypt at
the fastest them and I was able to

202
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,380
access and if I that I want

203
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,459
so at this point just statically compile
the back door

204
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:48,990
that just gives me a shelter must
reverse shell

205
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,350
I added the execution to eat Rd and I
rebooted

206
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,860
and I got the bug show so now it should
be able to

207
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,290
extract beach P streets checked the
environment out

208
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,579
and the wherever I want actually the
understand how everything works works

209
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:08,000
with this appliance so I started mapping

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,760
everything from a white box perspective
now this is interesting because

211
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,299
apparently the distribution is

212
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:20,220
slacker a 7.1 that from June 22

213
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,400
2000 death when I started

214
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,579
when I started playing with an affair
with like we're eight and I was about

215
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,240
fourteen-hour 30 I think level at

216
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,250
pretty old open SSL what about that

217
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,790
0.9 Quinn seventy March 17 2004

218
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,280
the and finally Apache

219
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,559
1.3 points 33 October 29 2004

220
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,439
so as you can see the whole environment
is ferry ferry

221
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:57,679
very very very old and and everything is
all that's not just

222
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,299
these so

223
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,089
this is one minute this applications are
vulnerable for

224
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,179
every one of them has about for a fun
abilities that are completely stable and

225
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,410
can be exploited

226
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,449
relatively easy and we're running on
Slackware 7.1

227
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:17,579
so there is no one has ever thought I've

228
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,280
ASLR back then are that are I think that

229
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,030
there's no nothing to protect any memory
corruptions

230
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,770
but there's still

231
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,730
have it's still very hard to exploit
have an ability

232
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,350
for an architecture that you don't even
know the dunno

233
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,370
the target architecture because you
don't know if it's part BC are

234
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,760
anything else for me 664 X 86

235
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
so we could we could order an appliance

236
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,360
of the bay and wait a couple of months
for it to arrive but

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,709
I want to on it on it right now

238
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:58,809
there's no time per the actual delivery

239
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:03,449
so we'll continue mapping everything out

240
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,010
I continued mapping things and I found
out that there are

241
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,400
they were a few unknown Apache models

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,209
that sounds interesting like we said for
yes age was a bit weird because it one

243
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,030
house to connect

244
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,089
so as it turns out the SSH is modified

245
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,380
it's not your normal sshd you have

246
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,770
a PS ox revealed that you have a binary
called at five

247
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,559
sshd so yeah came in at lunch
disassembler

248
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,919
and I checked it out and it basically
wraps

249
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,600
around sshd and the reason that it
failed the initial collection

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,010
connection was because expected you to
send it something

251
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,490
and if you send that the keyword f5

252
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,589
access it sends you back and encrypt it
bob

253
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:56,510
titled f5 support ticket so after the
whole project with I actually

254
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,559
talked with f5 and asked them about it
and they said that

255
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,949
it basically a support ticket and have
five can connect

256
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:06,939
remotely to any box because they have
the decryption keys

257
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:11,020
so I'm guessing that it's a pretty
interesting

258
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,589
for have placed to continue research but
I jumped at

259
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,000
and I continued analyzing everything
sense we can

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,630
down the PHP scripts now there's no
point in taking too deep into that

261
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,089
so I downloaded PHP scripts I

262
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:31,480
opened one on the scripts and this is
what I get

263
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,100
and said the whole thing as some sort of
a binary

264
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,250
but it's not a binary it's not the

265
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,089
I tried to set something if it does
didn't make any sense

266
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,679
so I started thinking what Candice

267
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,000
the that step looks very compressed
think

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,319
10 I don't know so

269
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,850
I decided to check the entropy have the
file

270
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,799
the character distribution star in this
graph you have

271
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,100
the green lines represent basically you
have 0

272
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,280
up until 255 which is the ASCII cut

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,289
and 0 up until 8 which is the percentage
of the file composed by that are ASCII

274
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:13,209
code

275
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,689
so as you can see in the green line you
have

276
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:21,329
on normal PHP script that basically
wherever you have a common character

277
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,730
you see a spike and the blue line is

278
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,240
for so what this means is that the file
is either

279
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,640
compressed bankrupted because the techno
character distribution is flat

280
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,620
so actually deed a smart run with been
walk up for it and I couldn't find any

281
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,900
confession heather's so apparently

282
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,610
the father is for probably in cryptid

283
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,030
cell I started digging about PHP
encryption

284
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,820
an obtuse cation as it turns out that
there are two types

285
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,780
have encryption an infestation on PHP
you have to

286
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,470
one that is basically on that text level
for you have

287
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,950
the actio you have a any cryptid blob
and you PHP does and you valor

288
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,700
the creep dove that that lab and

289
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,100
you have at the extension level were

290
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,410
you have a PHP extension that basically

291
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,450
once you're on PHP script when she asked
it to

292
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,420
compile PHP script for it basic
composite

293
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,460
it takes the bytecode it encrypts it and
then it save that

294
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,050
escape so you basically have and cryptid

295
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,690
and PHP bike not PHP texts

296
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,870
these people I could so I found one of
these appliances

297
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,870
on that one of these I'm an encryption
models

298
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,990
on the appliance and model called thank
you summer you may hurt a bit

299
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,050
I personally have never seen that before

300
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,880
and also found a talk by Stefan Esser
that explained that

301
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,710
the these solutions exist and you can
probably

302
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,350
ish there is tool there's a technique
that you can bypass them

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,600
and actually extracted PHP by Kurt and
basically

304
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,480
its some sort of a PHP reverse
engineering process

305
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,080
so as we said the solution composite
encrypts the PHP code

306
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,690
but there is a solution the solutions
call txt bomb it's basically a PHP

307
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,280
extension

308
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,110
that you used to and PDX about has a
subcomponent call their

309
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,490
feel the I think it's Vong some logical
done something

310
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,900
donor exactly and

311
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,200
he basically hooks I love the an app by
could handlers

312
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,090
and were and whoever gets called

313
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,450
basically dumped the representation of
what it did

314
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,190
in some sort of a you can see the flow
of everything that work

315
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,540
says this is an all I'm guessing that
some of the newer version applying cue

316
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,920
might have added for more protections
but this vision is all

317
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,930
like the whole environment so it should
probably work

318
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,710
about it's gonna be very hard to work
with something

319
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,120
but you need to get a binary for sacra
7.1 because

320
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,620
you don't have the compiler available
and the one that you do have a bit

321
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,910
available

322
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,410
is so all that it doesn't compile the
code and you have this there are nine

323
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,010
defendants

324
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,360
dependency chain that's you need to
solve so

325
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,840
if everything will fail go back to that
one but

326
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,020
a continuing examining the whole
environment before I'll

327
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,080
the into that one

328
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,460
I also enabled the MySQL lock this is
the

329
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,890
this is pretty useful because you can
see every query

330
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,950
as it gets executed you just eat you
just do

331
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,650
tell minus half on the SQL log and you
can see

332
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,950
the queries liked this for example is
part of the

333
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,410
process %uh vlogging with a valid with

334
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,350
within about getting I'm actually

335
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,350
so we should be able to detect things
like SQL injections relatively easy

336
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,390
how so continued and setting up the
whole instructions

337
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:15,100
the whole that environment I i tryed I
am try to start ills it wasn't easy

338
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,630
it took a while but I but we managed to
install a jiffy FSH and a lot of other

339
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,500
things up until now we were using

340
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,910
at the start and disgusting the first
show that

341
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,290
didn't get the hell that and the St the

342
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,630
Eric white well and it was very annoying

343
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,060
so I decided to take another look at the
restive their unknown

344
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,150
Apache miles and

345
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,910
as it turns out there is wanna
interesting what does

346
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,020
an especially interesting one that
tunnel handler

347
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,160
as you can see it gets exported
interview chill directory

348
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,280
which means that every week request that
you sent to slash tunnel

349
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,820
gets handled by panhandler at this point
we don't know

350
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,490
who actually handles it which one of the
Apache months because

351
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,750
and a patch among 16 lawn it look gets
loaded

352
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,070
it says I want to register December and
the handler

353
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,340
and a handler and that way you don't
really know

354
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,210
exactly at this point who and

355
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,130
so I immediately launch to be browser

356
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,310
and tried to access just left and the
rectory

357
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,340
and I get the error invalid parameters
make sense of it and send any

358
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,970
promised and I graft their passion miles

359
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,370
for that same error and I found it and I
found the binary to actually

360
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,510
creates that air and they figure it out

361
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:40,420
the missing parameters

362
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,330
and this is TX the actual era that you
get

363
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,060
so I started playing with the parameters
while having the log in a vote

364
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,070
and I found an SQL injection viability
so

365
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,860
that should be pretty easy right the
mascara runs as root

366
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,940
you have privileges to write you have
and every privilege

367
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,430
available MySQL so

368
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,710
just do a union select into outfile and
finish

369
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,740
everything up right so

370
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,290
this is the actual query informal
promise as well

371
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,510
and this is the SQL log once we

372
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,170
request hello single quote and the
session premier

373
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,990
we get hello single quote nothing felt

374
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,830
so usually when you when you work with
you when you will

375
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,450
want to exploit have an ability using a

376
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,510
right into outfile you do something
similar to this

377
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,910
where the black text is the

378
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,970
cost query and red ones

379
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,130
our user input so basically what you do
here

380
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,170
is you base yep and

381
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,230
hello and terminate the

382
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,760
query you do a union select have con-
Stata

383
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,890
into a handout file this is just for a
test but usually you do you would want

384
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,660
you to our

385
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,660
write it into a PHP script that way

386
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,320
whenever the PHP scripts get exit get
requested

387
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,720
the could get gets executed the data and
X gets written

388
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,240
internet file the cost values

389
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,180
and by the way there nine below is how
we progress as we propagate the query

390
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,030
and get understand thinks

391
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,430
cell when I sent the query AAA

392
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,820
space I got a8 percent twenty

393
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,950
as it turns out Apache mall doesn't
because your own quoted strings

394
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,190
so it's a bit annoying because we can't
use any spaces

395
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,010
but and I also a continued

396
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,020
trying a lot of different things because
I really want to be able to

397
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,540
you space isn't stuff so I sent

398
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,760
a space a8 and I get

399
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,290
AAA space is a space 0x1 point the
forty-two

400
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,410
so as the actual query

401
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,840
so apparently there is a format thing
gonna be at the

402
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,380
on that's the same argument and actually
found out that

403
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,280
assembly confirmed its for not saying
when ability

404
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,440
and here's another test you can see a
small stack trace

405
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,980
so this is nice and all but

406
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,030
we have a logical than ability there's
no point in explaining memory corruption

407
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,410
and as we said

408
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,570
before we already have like I don't know
how many viable application

409
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,750
have every obligations every application

410
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,870
on this appliance his former so there's
no point in the inning to death

411
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,130
so we should try to from to actually
exploit the SQL injection

412
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,930
and and it turns out we can't use any
spaces

413
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,220
so how can we broke at how can we
actually ride

414
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,690
a query and it's pretty easy

415
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,990
a you can use block comments his data
spaces it's no picnic used for

416
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,390
well forget if I won't buy passes for
right like eight years ago

417
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,580
but we still need to be able to

418
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,780
ignore the rest of the query because we
we were

419
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,309
we with one out right into outfile and
we don't want the rest in the query

420
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,790
to the story destroy a query

421
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,580
so you have the thing that you would
usually do is a minus minus

422
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,860
in a space which basically terminates
the rest the

423
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,640
qua so we continue updating

424
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,490
are query we added comments instead of

425
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,809
spaces and minus minus and a space

426
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,980
and no space at the time

427
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,540
so the documentation itself actually
confirm that you have to have the space

428
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,830
a tab won't work comment won't won't
work nothing went

429
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,740
but we already have from nothing fun
ability

430
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,710
from a four-month for four months thing
actually works the way that you have

431
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,680
percent being the format specifier then
you have an optional

432
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,680
padding character to Pat def the

433
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,950
output with if it doesn't reach that
character

434
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,220
with which is the twenty and this
example

435
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,030
and then you have the actual format
which is for example anticipate

436
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,300
decimal digit so if I'm writing at
percent

437
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,410
20 the I will have space base base base
base base base

438
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,030
an the number that actually

439
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,540
exist at the stock at the moment so this
should work

440
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,880
as a fella terminator because we can
always use percent

441
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,150
a hundred d and there's no number

442
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:45,059
that gets printed 200 let's not on 32 or
64-bit systems

443
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,180
sup this actually works as about
terminator just doing a minus minus

444
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,240
percent twenty

445
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,950
well have minus minus space the space
and the rest at the credit gets ignored

446
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,820
because it's already commented

447
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,840
so actually composed the Union select
into outfile

448
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,620
with the fellas Terminator and
everything but it failed

449
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,440
my everything seems to be fine
everything looks

450
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,520
alright fell I

451
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,030
connected to the box using SSH and I
tried running the query myself

452
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,240
and it still failed which is it strange
that I tried

453
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,850
modifying a few things and fair then I
tried the most trivial

454
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,640
union select query from the MySQL
documentation

455
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,059
and it felt as well so as it turns out

456
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,090
remember how we said everything is so
old the mask your version

457
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,970
is three-point 23 and

458
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,170
so a little bit about MySQL 3.23

459
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:50,300
no union select none method': queries

460
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,210
we can't do it do it joined because with
the while condition but that's unrelated

461
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,360
but basically I love your previous SQL
injection exploitation techniques

462
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,590
will fail because it's too old for them

463
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,220
fell but we cannot write that the
results of the existing query into our

464
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,670
into an outbound so it's nice

465
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,860
we should probably examined the actual
table to see if we can use it

466
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,230
do something else but right now we can
control it

467
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,170
so basically what we do you know to to
actually write

468
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,630
the existing query into and how file

469
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,150
we replaced the did there is an original

470
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,929
come for it compressed come pre Africa

471
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:39,420
comparing kids and remove it

472
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,320
yet modified with or one equal one so
that

473
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,650
it will always work and they're right
that into an IFOP

474
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,120
so that way you have the whole content
of the query

475
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,580
above the table written in tar file
whenever

476
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,420
the table itself that they were itself
is ppl like sessions

477
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,890
he basically contain contains a log of
all sessions

478
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,850
that there were ever made it's not just
the active once

479
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,980
so it could be pretty useful because it
does contain the active ones

480
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,170
so you should be able to just Tampa in
turn out file

481
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,000
into the misfit into the Web Service
Directory

482
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,809
and just requested and you can use other
people sessions

483
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,429
that's nice but it's not that good

484
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:27,460
if we could however update updated and

485
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,480
add and PHP code into it and then right
into it

486
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,910
php file we would be able to execute on
call

487
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,800
but it only gets updated once you login
successfully

488
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,200
so it's not that good

489
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,500
how death was my personal Frank point I

490
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,670
I spent like two days just reading the
documentation

491
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,620
reading the source code trying to find
logical viability

492
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,809
somehow exploiting this one a bit

493
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,320
responsibility and then I found

494
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,980
an interesting post on Stack Overflow

495
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,429
you have you you have field terminators

496
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,700
apparently some some I want to export
his data into CSV file

497
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,460
so as you can see here you have feel
terminated by

498
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,780
arbitrary day a so maybe

499
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:23,440
I can place my own PHP code in there

500
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,440
so this happy did the query to contain

501
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,950
a small PHP call the valuation

502
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,440
with the field super separated by

503
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,510
and I got caught execution

504
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:43,510
15 that's very interesting

505
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,850
so this is nice there's a minor downside
because you have

506
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,560
feel fifth separators or filter mares
align terminators

507
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,320
you have to have lines our fields so you
have to have

508
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,300
some content within that table but

509
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,500
as we said before the table logs

510
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,620
all sessions it's not just the current
active once

511
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,250
so if an admin has ever logged into the
server just to configure it

512
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,040
to change the default password two years
ago it would still work

513
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,290
and if it didn't you can use the default
password so so it's a win-win he doesn't

514
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,660
matter

515
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,850
but I'm guessing it's not much to ask in
a production environment

516
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,620
so we got root pretty nice

517
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,910
but what can we do other than that how
can we continue

518
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,770
as we said we might be is what might
have some difficulties

519
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,310
advanced onto the network because at the
firewall so

520
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,350
we can start by just installing a
rootkit I assume it shouldn't be a

521
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,890
problem

522
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,090
on Cypress 7.1 unless it's just too old
for my

523
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,220
modern Ricketts and you can just sniff
the traffic

524
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,690
your after that has a son Tripp Shin so
everything that is

525
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,460
not corrected within the network you can
just increased

526
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,940
sniff right away you have to be dumped
available on the box for diagnostic so

527
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,250
you can use it for whatever you want you
could also

528
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:12,620
man in the middle PBM clients suppose
that someone wants to connect to

529
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,720
an internal RDP server you can just grab
that pack at

530
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,540
send it on to the net do whatever you
want

531
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,760
sniff it and modify things turned into a

532
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,700
hardstyle at 7 we can also extract
certificates

533
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,050
apparently some companies actually used
la carte certificate

534
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,940
in a way that VP & Dot excise that dot
com

535
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,640
uses the same certificate as aaww that
excise that that come

536
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,900
so you can just extract these and

537
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,710
obviously the best probe the party the
best scenario is to just create your own

538
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,320
user

539
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,440
and join the network and away from with
your

540
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,150
exploit toolkit but there's something
out that you can do as well

541
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,230
you could attacked the actual VPN
clients so

542
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,480
suppose that the add me and wants to
connect has some

543
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,690
ticket opened at the 6 a.m.

544
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,890
at Saturday night it saturday morning

545
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,090
and he needs to connect remotely so he
has he probably has

546
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,960
way to connect to the network and
actually manage everything

547
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,330
what if the way to you actually connect

548
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,679
is you request script and you get
prompted to install an ActiveX

549
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,790
that fixes assigned 0 but

550
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,750
if installation fails it asks you to and
execute the foot to install the

551
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,540
following

552
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,100
as a circle SSL VPN client so anyone has
any idea for a new client

553
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,330
I'm guessing most people well actually
install it

554
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,220
but you're still a bit limited I was

555
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,650
actually to guide at through the network
background for me

556
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,900
I was telling him about this one and he
said there's no reason to do that

557
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,250
because as as an SSL VPN

558
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,510
administrator I can tell the SSL VPN to

559
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,070
do whatever he wants on your computer
once you login make and

560
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,300
updates K like a lot of scripts so
apparently you can do that

561
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,660
and when I tried at it asked me

562
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,890
he told me that has only been once to
ran something on your computer

563
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,740
will you allow it and apparently it just
happens because

564
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,060
the SSL VPN wasn't on my trusted hosts
but I'm assuming that a from managing

565
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,090
one it should be on my first post

566
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm not sure so

567
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,180
a little bit about the actual viability
disclosure process

568
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,820
it was pretty amazing I contacted f5

569
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,730
they responded within about for hours

570
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,120
it having to live and they told me thank
you thank you thank you

571
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,430
please give us the technical details
will try to fix it as soon as possible

572
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,170
and they fixed that and about four days
which was

573
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,610
and they actually patched it in a way
that

574
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:05,770
actually and that its actually passion
and then just patch that actually had a

575
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,300
another like six out as the race as well
but they passed

576
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,560
those as well some its they've did a
pretty good job and a

577
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,240
also wanna me to stay here that they
want to work with all with all

578
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,180
researchers so

579
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,000
you can contact them here if you'd like
so

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,420
yeah thats summary too much

581
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,420
let's just do a demo

582
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:54,170
now okay

583
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,160
Agresso while everything loads up tell
you

584
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,550
but I'd actually invited me at five to

585
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,830
their private event and in black hat

586
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:15,010
and they're pretty awesome

587
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,370
there we had a better me to eat dinner
with a couple of other researchers and

588
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:25,040
fevers and everything and i five was
pretty fun now it's a

589
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I think it should be available now ok

590
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:39,820
no yet

591
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,650
okay

592
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,380
so this is the actual login screen the
initial one that uses you're supposed to

593
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,090
login with

594
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,560
and here's

595
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,900
the time handler that you get terrorists
from

596
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,330
so

597
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,720
for a actually explain it just thats
letting you know

598
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:12,720
there is no such scale not how much
eating

599
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,040
to find a clear

600
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,790
okay so now let's see

601
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:39,790
if we get it

602
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm and we got planned execution

603
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,130
now apparently I'm not I'm not root I'm
your own

604
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,810
and I do it that actually was pretty
interesting because I kept seeing your

605
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,170
room

606
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,050
so apparently your arm is accompany

607
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,790
that used to and actually developed an
SSL VPN appliance

608
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,340
and as you can guess it's this one have
five

609
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,410
about them like ano six or seven years
ago

610
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,040
Myanmar a lot a long time ago so yes

611
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,450
that should help with my so andric
that's good enough

612
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,360
I don't care and we can also get

613
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:32,360
an actual we first show because they
have netcat available

614
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,040
your so now I can actually work work
well with everything

615
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,060
for so yeah it works

616
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:59,060
and

617
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:05,080
snack

618
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:12,080
ok

619
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,410
