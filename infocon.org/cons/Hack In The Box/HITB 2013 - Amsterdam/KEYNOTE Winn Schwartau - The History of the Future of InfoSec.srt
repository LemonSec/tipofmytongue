1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,710
well

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:15,710
well

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,750
yes

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,700
be the last speaker is often difficult
because all the same incident between

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,990
you and the beer

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,650
is me so if you want to start drinking
now make sure I get one first

7
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,190
make sure that for the next several
hours we do have a lot of things to talk

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,950
about

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,989
this year represents my 30th year
information security

10
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,610
up

11
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,910
I still don't understand it

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,670
is really really hard and over last 30
years I had a lot of opportunities to do

13
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,360
a lot of

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,760
really fun great thanks and

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,040
last year was actually kinda put
together some ideas

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,530
of where I think things are going within
the field with you doing right

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,750
what if we don't we're all and public on
present some of these ideas

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,460
and some release care what I call
delivering. TRAI some of them aren't so

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,200
bad

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,220
but I also didn't put a challenge to you

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,790
community not just here in Holland and
Germany and France the United States and

22
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,600
Canada

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,670
Asia where the community understands the
problems in many ways far better

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,130
and organizations and governments to I
want a chance to use it as I resist some

25
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,800
of these ideas that may be water to move
them

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,560
you can actually do something more than
just you might actually be returned

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,430
facer

28
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,320
or come up with something really new
ideas and new ways of doing things

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,940
because I know this so much a technology
i touch today

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,380
is the safest of I don't option for
thirty years

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,700
and is still doesn't work

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,310
were running that's the plan on it so we
need to do some serious rethinking this

33
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,090
is wine also history the future what
scares the living tsk

34
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,350
my wife's morning anybody know that's a
picture of

35
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:25,350
anybody there's a clue haha slot much my

36
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,300
course it is who said that are be
careful there you go

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,700
or throw votes

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,200
be careful back in the late eighties
when I got involved

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,850
space I start worrying about privacy in
espionage inside

40
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,060
for and Commerce said to me I was out of
my mind none of this is going to happen

41
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:57,060
why the bad guys ever want to use the
Internet was what the US Congress

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,680
ass so

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,939
I did a lot of predicting a lot of ideas
that scared the bejesus outta me thirty

44
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,769
years ago

45
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,170
and they still do because we haven't
done very much

46
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,890
powers if anything we're in much worse
shape

47
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,340
and we're gonna cover some of those
things that really really bother me so

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,750
we're gonna

49
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,230
look at the three basic triads domains

50
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,110
islands a look up there what's wrong
with this picture

51
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,730
who said first watcher hey other

52
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,900
cops does one make sure you're awake at
five o'clock 63 mango mains in the first

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,500
is the human

54
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,269
we are unfortunately tend to look at
technology technology technology in the

55
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:43,900
media is hot spot technology

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,219
and always craved tax stuff that's going
on but what we really find out how many

57
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,090
problems

58
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,400
that are occurring out they really sired

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,439
wanna call it how many other really
human based

60
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,560
we've ignored because we don't know how
two kinds

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,010
Roland so it's better for this role
technology will

62
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,810
for human that works really really well
that's enough

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,879
so in the domain of you what really
scares you look at the jesus said make

64
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,780
there for the united and I say says US
Commerce

65
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,060
ASI areas in

66
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,160
a difference and now they're planning on
acid for

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,920
for cybersecurity wasn't or its help us

68
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,730
and these are lawyers these guys

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,670
who never of the bad guys

70
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,710
use the Internet for the unanimity any
wonderful for the world now

71
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,240
or something cancer this really scares
me

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,060
as to what they're gonna try to do in
2014 government organisations in Europe

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,980
and a jerk consider do as well how much
more can make screw it up

74
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,050
by getting involved an awful lot on his
mind

75
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,069
fear I really bothered me that nobody
can really seems to care

76
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,090
right now the last several weeks we've
seen some noise we sing them and even

77
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,850
more

78
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,050
and china's doing the South Korea North
Korea Iran

79
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,449
receive a list of but thirty years is
taking him for people to start talking

80
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:20,840
about

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,030
open 40 that's how most people don't
give a shit

82
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,120
fate of care part of our responsibility

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,270
is dead take care a lot more than they
do

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,560
specially him the human domain a because
this is where so many of the failings

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,630
have been is resigning technology for
technocrats

86
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,729
not firm on a Hot Pocket

87
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,940
shield were designing stuff for the
wrong people

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,630
we've got probably the United States a
lot more we have been on hold you

89
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,650
US is the center of the universe the
universe and everything around the world

90
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,289
suffers from United States

91
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,410
and therefore any rules and policies
casa for america

92
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,180
unfortunately for fourth with that is
not true

93
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,930
we have a very minor few and its defense
like this

94
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,250
that are outside the united states that
really really helps fighting get that

95
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,370
non-u_s_ centrifugal with the figures 13
percent

96
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,270
of US citizens now could legally trout

97
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,430
internationally why only thirteen
percent of us have passports

98
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,220
so we've got a very myopic see or
limiting County

99
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,069
and a county would like to burn or shine
your opening line

100
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,400
and many people thousands upon thousands
them

101
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,520
never believe the county further inspire

102
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,919
us and we're connecting them to the rest
of the world

103
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,620
we wonder why we have an awful use this
gives back to educational problems in

104
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,280
this is

105
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,650
and my 100 on a US problem but if we
carry a big stick we also have

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,250
the big responsibility to put ourselves
on first-world

107
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,129
inappropriate contacts when it keeps
what it means trying to keep this whole

108
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:08,500
thing

109
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,840
working all the time try obviously

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,530
of September 1998 I was doing some
training

111
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,060
with special operations forces at Fort
Bragg North Carolina

112
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,190
man during that week Chinese P away

113
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,460
People's Liberation Army enough document
and was called unrestricted warfare

114
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,389
for those beautiful body was history
Germany in mexico did the same thing in

115
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,930
1917

116
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,699
when Germany trying to get it Mexico to
invade the United States

117
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:42,530
and that's cool ritual Zimmerman
telegram unrestricted warfare

118
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,050
chided the same thing in 1998 the
published 240 page book

119
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,620
and it's set fundamentally ever
conventional war with the United States

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,889
we lose in a nuclear war with the United
States

121
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,789
we lose therefore we're gonna change the
rules for giving away some actor

122
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,340
we hereby expire the critical
infrastructures

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,240
and economic size and interests of the
united states to be legitimate

124
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,610
targets of conflict

125
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,669
what have they been doing for the last
fifteen years

126
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,490
is this a big surprise this goes back to
the nasty

127
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,860
ignorance is areas from too many more
leaders

128
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,490
it's not a problem %uh don't worry about
it fun demanding they don't get it

129
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,930
understand if another what we're looking
around

130
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,159
what the technology is what can be done
to have any handle that yes

131
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,420
shouldn't worry about this a long long
time ago

132
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,510
what is the dirtiest four-letter words
you can think of

133
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,170
for security good question

134
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,810
for security for say

135
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,490
shared a user who said that

136
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,760
what's yeah of user of course

137
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
users are open ultimate brawl

138
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,190
we plan to use we do training and
security awareness and forty-one percent

139
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,470
of them still screwed up on their tested
the next day

140
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,860
we love our users with water users

141
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,800
be productive but they're the ones that
are really really screwing it up

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,820
we want everybody to be connected yet
those beans

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,350
more users how many users can we sustain

144
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,010
right now for to some figures there's
six billion active intelligent Endpoint

145
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,920
users of the fire

146
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,959
how many people know what they're doing
terribly everybody's

147
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,850
AT&T you're gonna give it 5 percent

148
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,279
of given point all

149
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,620
0 5 percent three million people

150
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,130
and I cannot defend that number all but
I don't I don't believe it is $300

151
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,660
million

152
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,500
tax around the plant serious reading

153
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,190
really friends up there what is the
second

154
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,750
dirtiest word reconfigure love when it
comes to security

155
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,350
there is a clue who said we're

156
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,839
which he said group

157
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,310
she said watch it

158
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,829
of course yeah how are we still dealing
with the story

159
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:39,850
why sometimes

160
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,920
spouses past have two cities are track

161
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,800
to write a big check civic every knows
what's going on many Bay

162
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,860
organizations two signatures in order
make sure sanity check what's going on

163
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,459
why we have some operating systems while
have an operating environments insight

164
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,760
about patients inside

165
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,350
mission-critical operations why do we
still have

166
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,040
room it is beyond me that it's still
exists and it scares the hell out of

167
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,510
because

168
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,209
week gear multiple controls are have a
mathematical treatise coming out the

169
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,300
next few months

170
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,769
that was shown mathematically how bad it
is is

171
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,589
using multiple we've users

172
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,810
using Boolean warlock mathematics is

173
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,720
showing how incredibly done we are how
bad things have gone

174
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,889
United States this is really considered
improper profile

175
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,880
I of profile people

176
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,730
we profile guess find out what's good
what's bad

177
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,350
we profiled traffic what's good what's
bad communication

178
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,940
morning but were not allowed to profile

179
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,240
people's behavior because that's
politically incorrect fire

180
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,950
rights since Saini

181
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,360
that we give away leave controls to
people

182
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,899
in organizations with cops to lose for
mission-critical operations

183
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,350
you were not a large profile

184
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,700
however under the traditional way of
america is looking at it

185
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,110
what you guys do at airports here any
water if we get to the ticket counter

186
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,010
very nice young couple says I went for a
bit which began to wanna chat for about

187
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,240
30 seconds

188
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,630
and their profile the looking for

189
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,320
my eyes it has something to do with one
word to fundamentally looking for just

190
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,209
the sense

191
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,670
do I have any deception

192
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,730
in my reactions were interaction with
for

193
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,220
if I do that I'll take me over 70 SA
with the Americans deal with P

194
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,000
but in the states were not allowed to do
that everybody

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,120
is guilty at all times until proven
innocent

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,560
and so we to or start making the system
work inside mission critical places

197
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,310
we have to get some serious profile
going

198
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,370
because if we'd of we're gonna end up

199
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,019
with worse conditions that we currently
have especially when it comes to senior

200
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:11,980
management

201
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,100
and senior technical leadership and
administration

202
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,589
throughout all of their respective
organizations

203
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,139
wires mufflers lawyers in the room

204
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,269
anybody want to admit being a lawyer

205
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,430
nobody ever but all the players were
getting low right now

206
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,829
lawyers ones are causing so much it was
from seoul get on with the human domain

207
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,399
they do not understand the consequences
of what they're thinking about

208
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,360
victims that come out other aroused
crazy things they say

209
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,480
and then find it makes politically
correct walks

210
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,699
United States why is is so ridiculously
hard for us to fire somebody

211
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:56,810
clearly violates policy caused a
security incident

212
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,600
inside an organization why can't we
fired

213
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,660
because the lawyers are scared that the
person they fire is gonna sue the

214
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,540
company

215
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,870
and it's going to cost more money for
doing the right for

216
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,070
stupid have to get over this is star
really

217
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,899
dealing with the human domain the way
that people need to be done

218
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,980
worth know this crosses over to
something here

219
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,110
really really bad shrink I don't know
the answer right now

220
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,220
thais ago between human male protecting

221
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,589
originally from New York we walk down
the streets

222
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,139
if somebody tries to promote you you're
allowed to take away his knife

223
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,139
or his gone or you can run like hell

224
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:47,029
you have the right to defend yourself

225
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,190
in our world and specifically the laws

226
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,149
I am most familiar with those in the
United States

227
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:59,850
it is illegal for me to remove your
cyber weapon

228
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,610
thank you that for self not only can I
not shoot you

229
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,459
not only can I take no offensive action
I could not defend myself by removing

230
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,050
your weapon system

231
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,410
and as the current state of the law does
that make any sense

232
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,240
now there are certainly some legitimate
arguments here about proportionality

233
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,910
proportional response a proper
indication some warnings identification

234
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,269
false attribution gets these are all

235
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:30,529
woodshed a bit pieces of a puzzle

236
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,649
but at the same time because it seems to
be a hard problem in its

237
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,790
a few months I'm we have not taken the
time to examine

238
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,639
how do we solve this problem how do we
design

239
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,639
a construct whether it's legal or
technical

240
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,839
or some combination of the two

241
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,550
that allows me to remove your weapon
system if you're doing something hostile

242
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,709
to make

243
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:58,910
I think it's something we desperately
desperately need and I think the

244
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,339
community at large

245
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,230
would be great to have discussion points
on this to really analyze

246
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,699
what we can do whether it's open source
commercial products doesn't matter

247
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:13,589
the second domain gets into the
technical stuff

248
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,870
and that's where a lot of this
conversation has been going on

249
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,199
and there's just so many things that
we've tender automatically put into the

250
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,269
technical to Maine with

251
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,120
out release realizing that fake connect

252
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,709
to the human element they connect to the
physical and I remember in the early

253
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,959
days people to

254
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,230
cyberspace is virtual doesn't exist
anywhere

255
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,620
article when it there's a router there's
a wire

256
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,790
there's a hard drive there's a magnetic
domain where's the virtuality there is a

257
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,839
strong physical component to this

258
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,870
but you're completely ignoring and now
that we're seeing attention made ICS and

259
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,709
SCADA systems going on anybody over us
in the room with me to remember

260
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,420
something early software

261
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,699
virus is back in the eighties that would
make the day has chatter up and down and

262
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,660
eat the hard drives

263
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,470
yeah few hands over I mean its hostile
but it's cool to prove the point

264
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,790
and finally somebody actually did start
redesigning hard drives and

265
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,860
the heads are so operated in a different
manner

266
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,790
so so many things technically that
really really bother me

267
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,630
these guys no offense to the vendors
here is all the vendors are here are

268
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,730
perfect and wonderful

269
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,790
I know this

270
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,120
and I'm not gonna pick on any one vendor
at all its what I was just at Rs a

271
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,690
and of I was really pissed off I wrote
an article on it in SC magazine

272
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,020
and it says I was disgusted with Risa

273
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,370
I was discussed it for two main reasons:
number one

274
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,650
why we need big breasted women with

275
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,970
I hat inserted into their shirts

276
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:53,150
to attract me to their booth I didn't
think it made sense

277
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,160
number 21 sure attracted into the booth
finding somebody that could speak

278
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,310
tactically about their own products and
services

279
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,450
was impossible because those are the
booth babes

280
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,460
the sales reps on anybody were third am
is often a customer and really doing

281
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,820
some

282
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,400
use for work that was really a feather
come looking for stuff

283
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,350
and then we go to the eventual we'll
talk some geek at least get to some

284
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,180
level of understanding

285
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,850
that yes up to give your 37 pics slashed
and J

286
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,580
and all your care or not care that's on
me but don't be a complete idiot

287
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,260
so you're gonna set up a forty-minute
whether it's for me because I'm asking

288
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,740
you a simple question about how your
stack works

289
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,430
so vendors bother me the second portion
vendors the bother me in this occurred

290
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,400
at Rs a

291
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,940
I'm not picking on our sex I love the
show up

292
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,160
our security fixes every for

293
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,810
our next-generation firewall is the next
step next-generation firewall which is

294
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,440
better than the prior

295
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,950
next-generation firewall that's their
headline

296
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,870
what the hell do you do know

297
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,800
companies no longer can explain in
simple terms what's going on

298
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,780
and this is a marketing and public
relations fiasco

299
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,870
geeks 10 what do you guys do I care

300
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,440
medicare day maybe I will make sure just
gimme that 3

301
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,720
sentences what do you do and don't
bullshit me in the process

302
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,510
so I get you really really annoyed
vendors that a promising

303
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,750
that they absolutely do everything we
all know there's no way in hell they can

304
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,770
but they're sucking Adam awful of

305
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:36,370
up the upper technical management people
who are not technical enough

306
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,930
not to buy into the bullshit that the
vendors are putting out

307
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,930
weaponization no matter what technology
comes out will be weaponized

308
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,380
we did with higher want to be on the
clock all good I can stab

309
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,680
Buffalo we weaponized fire

310
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,910
when we look at any technological
advance made in the last six thousand

311
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,490
seven thousand years

312
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,530
history often shows us the good side

313
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,730
but we use geese ought to be able to
very quickly understand

314
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,480
well look what they did with this will
have a turn this into a bad thing how

315
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:13,850
they

316
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,050
weaponized just like the internet is not
a weapon

317
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,920
cyberspace TCPIP not all these are
weapons are there

318
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,160
the original conceive a Spencer back in
nineteen 60 in the house this is just 50

319
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,130
will scientific experiment

320
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,370
everything we create becomes weaponized

321
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,410
everything you create becomes what a
nice

322
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,630
and my suggestion is that when we come
out with a new technologies that are

323
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,720
supposed to be good and helpful for
Mopar

324
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,550
and business and the playa up but
instead of

325
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,750
listening to the marketing and PR folks
again

326
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,320
and just concentrating up this is going
to make your life wonderful

327
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,550
we ought to say this is gonna make your
life wonderful

328
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,840
but in three to five years the bad guys
are gonna figure out how to

329
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,260
really screw with your and cause hell
maybe we should think about that before

330
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,680
we massively deployed

331
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,400
we need to be thinking about the
weaponization of all technology

332
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,450
well before its broad-based acceptance
and deployment

333
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,990
no matter what we come up with weather
is it. oriented

334
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,940
by oriented we've got up anybody seagull
over here the

335
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,920
TV show was awful 60 minutes or 10 the
new shows in the US

336
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,040
and they've actually now been able to
get brain waves

337
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,300
to completely control the prosthetics on
quadriplegics

338
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,170
and allow them to pick up a glass allow
them to put food in their mouth

339
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,270
allow the for Sat expect really really
work all for brain control

340
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,690
as they've got enough research into the
neocortex to be able to identify

341
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,230
which you're on packets are doing in
which order patterns

342
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,220
absolutely awesome so now in 10 years

343
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,360
we've at a ballgame you've got a lot of
people who probably could not have gone

344
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,670
to a bowl game weather at soccer
baseball football

345
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,260
and they're in their wheelchairs the
Gulf percent devices and some

346
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:17,150
asshole decides to take control over cuz
it's on unregulated skater

347
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,230
it's not funny dude he's laughing

348
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,400
only the ice cream cone with the head
yet but

349
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,300
we're all thinking yes yes I know but
think of the bad

350
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,070
think about taking over the wheelchair
controls is that cybernetic

351
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,720
is a cyber is a human is it by which all
integrated technology

352
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,920
that we're finally figuring out how to
get by electronic stuff really work to

353
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,690
each other

354
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,500
what about the bad stuff what we need to
do from a defensive standpoint

355
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,560
on very very beginning

356
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,860
before we start trying to patch

357
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,000
four steps in 10 years I think that
we've made that mistake for four decades

358
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,430
and was no reason to continue with that
at all

359
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,420
should be defense is my god people about
you then

360
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,230
unit was created and we built this thing
based upon the military US military the

361
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,580
Brits were involved is very busy on

362
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,630
Canada and we call fortress mentality

363
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,750
and the of Los Angeles store standpoint
sketch

364
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,710
castle inside the castle education we
gots search got built vegetables and you

365
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,350
can live

366
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,790
as officers know when you can see from
the top a long way

367
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,730
in what feels imply a little bit do
something but by and large said you've

368
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,750
got off

369
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,710
mode you get a drawbridge

370
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,350
we invented a drawbridge in 1969

371
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,360
on a trip to the basis of the gutter and
we had this mental confusion which we

372
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,970
still do

373
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,220
you're running a store beautiful
chocolate store on Main Street

374
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,810
do you want the bad guys coming into
your store

375
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,710
he goes no up do you want to bash coming
into your store

376
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,180
where they like chocolate

377
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,750
and what should we be looking for this
goes back to the human and the behavior

378
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,130
looking at the behavior protection
mechanisms and modeling

379
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,330
yet fortress mentality and we'd have
done with connections both collection

380
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,240
action action was like economic

381
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,620
are up conversations

382
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,540
is an even more binary finish we treat a
digital world is all its binary

383
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,610
and its there's lots in shades of gray
in the middle

384
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,960
not everything is black and white it's
not always

385
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,510
are off so fortress mentality PK model
to defend

386
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,070
against bad guys on the Internet when
the DOD tomorrow defense the US came out

387
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,960
with models

388
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,170
an 83 85 87 where Hong and now we

389
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,600
our stock into the somewhere in the
middle

390
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,920
I want people I don't want people I
trust people

391
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,010
I don't trust people and that we're back
to the concept of users until we have

392
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,800
some new theory

393
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,210
fundamental theoretical change of what
we need by the defense

394
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,850
and how we we side effects and how we
can detect and react to detected

395
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,570
anomalies if you will

396
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,410
in real time when it comes to use

397
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,750
and we can improve this far greater love

398
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,260
currently have we're still going to be
relied upon

399
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,520
ball that was built on track way

400
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,300
in the cold war based upon defensive
technologies from six thousand years ago

401
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,560
I think we should be doing better than
that today

402
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,980
you %uh the slightest in part of a
discussion for twenty years

403
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,890
or lesser versions over that's coming up
right now from the careers

404
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,040
as to what's gonna happen over there for
mess that is

405
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,520
but insider gonna for 40 connet

406
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,350
the United States has said as a matter
of policy but the policy is not to

407
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,320
disclose

408
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,780
his pacifier if you screw with a certain
of

409
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,800
inside world you

410
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,880
and we've left at all but is a strong
possibility

411
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,940
so for the last thirty years I've been
at this

412
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,070
how much cider or install how much of
this split between cyberattack Michael

413
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,210
and the Connecticut warfare have-we
really been looking at

414
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,760
and I would argue over 20 years ago we
knew that this was gonna be comin

415
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,260
but again we chose to ignore and right
now as you read the papers is over the

416
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,170
last several days this is actually
becoming

417
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,400
policy discussions going on out

418
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,320
with USB Drive allies around the world
as to how to

419
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,900
attacked if a side thereof at

420
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,030
is estimates for enough to create a
Connecticut response

421
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:06,060
and then how to contain it this is also
part of pork chops

422
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,430
because we're running the whole big
pieces and hopefully not the bombs all

423
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,150
the other stuff but those

424
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,810
triggering mechanisms the analysis of
the data integrity concerts over

425
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,900
we don't have it together yet and I just
think by many really really should

426
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,230
dirty word is used so

427
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,700
we give users this kind of stuff

428
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,030
gobs and gobs and gobs controls I

429
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,610
microsoft word what's the next fall
after

430
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,690
but I think I use three functions in
them ball Fossil watch

431
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,680
think it's all items solitaire yet in
sight words

432
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,640
what nine thousand different things you
can do how many people you know

433
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,820
why don't we have stuff to is a little
more suited to

434
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,090
for the have reached user

435
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:03,710
let's make things a little simpler

436
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,770
we have the technology to make things
simpler this goes back to the vendor

437
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,880
question we're going to give them more
features so version 5.0

438
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,530
better than version 4.5 and we have to
have thirteen men use morse

439
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:22,160
stuff is set on making it easier and
simpler for the

440
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,190
average user and consumer complex
application

441
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:33,230
is the antithesis of security yet
because the marketing people PR people

442
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,520
product managers really don't understand
what's going on inside the were too many

443
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,330
these things

444
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,070
mister more skidmore let's get more and
we will

445
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,110
will fix it later if anything

446
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,390
ever goes wrong again I got a problem
office

447
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,750
so that wallace's created

448
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,470
effing the nyquil binary degradation
graceful degradation

449
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,110
eight years ago

450
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,190
pointe shoes in Paris and the local law

451
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,010
McDonald's is called quick and we wanted
to get our burgers and a coke or

452
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:09,540
whatever

453
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,050
was one morning and all the screens were
flashing with NC 40

454
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,600
errors nosers are

455
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,090
can't get you burger until servers want
them to be ready

456
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,750
what could take several hours do you
have a pet

457
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,240
yes you have paid for yes try to make an
order

458
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,240
no up the reliance upon the technology
to such an extent that we have no fall

459
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,040
is going to be

460
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,440
we can be seen on punch this coming up
as the speed awesome

461
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,940
tax and he's other events are going on
because since you can't defend ourselves

462
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,640
very good weapons enemies system

463
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,350
are only answer many cases to time of
the systems

464
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,840
we don't have a mechanisms for
deprivation reliable

465
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,510
operation on some small subset of at
least one internal water on and off

466
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:08,240
at least I could take your 500 pay for
my brothers

467
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,040
summer the simple things that we all
roll of paper and pencil

468
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,630
have good you racist under the concept
of digital redundancy

469
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,160
grade 1 I'll fix everything yet here we
are

470
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,190
again this really bothers me

471
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,740
and as we get more and more down the
road information warfare the site

472
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,230
for all bad guys doing all that stuff
we're gonna see more and more of this is

473
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:35,580
well

474
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,550
first I'm not sure have a real strong
opinion there but right now

475
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm not moving my universe the clock

476
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,610
I'm not recommending to and my clients
at the most so much of their universe to

477
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,540
the clout

478
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,750
business from me was just too many on go

479
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,010
us was a 2-3 weeks ago I'm not talking
about Microsoft's

480
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,960
fire down for an hour IBM's went down
Rackspace went down for a bit

481
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,010
and I'm really not sure that we have

482
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:12,570
of the proper technologies resiliency at
this point or even a little construct to

483
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,160
be able to defend

484
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,910
clout operation I'm just not sure we
have it yet

485
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,710
and I have to talk to me lawyers if I
have twelve thousand points in this

486
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,480
cloud in the bag race command because I
shoot back to answer fully gonna be no

487
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,950
that means I won't have twelve thousand
potential victims all that trouble

488
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,040
if you play the game League yet from
other

489
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,680
so I think it's something again that we
need to really look at from the human

490
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,370
side look at this technical thing we're
building for the human side

491
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,960
and understand the downside
ramifications are

492
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,470
before we go full-tilt blow into a
little something really really goes well

493
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:56,900
4G this is gonna be cited or 4G

494
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,460
right now of

495
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,810
I'll what is this notes of

496
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:09,870
what is this it's a computer

497
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:16,870
sound iPhone iPhone stuffs day it's not
a sense on either

498
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,720
do that doesn't matter if it's I'm
getting up using fifty thousand feet is

499
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,640
a computer

500
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,510
these things have got how much more
power than we had a mainframe in the

501
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,570
sixth season order

502
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,770
so have you tomorrow there at two
billion that

503
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,650
now we're going in a few years my
refrigerator

504
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,860
is gonna call my car to tell me that the
mill

505
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,060
is ready at the supermarket for me to
pick up

506
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,640
ICS skated TCPIP also gets of each other

507
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,340
we have 20 billion intelligent and

508
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,400
points and for every two that were in on
the type of just before this one

509
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,350
on be operating system and environmental
pickups you can't whose

510
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:06,510
really cool tools this is gonna again be
a huge problem because we're

511
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,780
recreating something that we've already
got we've been

512
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,780
building up this incredible
infrastructure for how many years

513
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,480
now we can do it all over again it was
all be mobile

514
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,910
but we have a perfect storm that's fit

515
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,070
has not yet this is what my predictions

516
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,620
and I hope I'm wrong but for so

517
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,190
you a big thumbs up these intelligent
points I don't mean the user's be

518
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,360
intelligent

519
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,680
is a user's by and large clueless
comment either provide any level

520
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,010
security

521
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,150
these devices have no fundamental
security mechanisms in them

522
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,240
doing security white on the just really
really

523
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,330
really hard and yet were my favorite in
the whole world

524
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:51,370
$680 million if love Facebook's $1
billion

525
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,590
users use it exclusively available

526
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,280
was a staggering figure to be made him
realize that

527
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,640
so you got the backbone guys our own
jobs keep it clean wire from point A to

528
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,240
point be okay fine structure game I get
it

529
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,060
but then you go really smart back to us

530
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,360
so how we know weather app is good

531
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,220
were at his bat and there's been so
little bit of work done in that area

532
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,080
but fundamentally it misconception is

533
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,190
up its gonna happen in this case all

534
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,480
if this at comes in we'll review it to
make sure

535
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,280
its Apple approved I mean it's a

536
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,280
no of stuff what they do not do
something we cannot expect them to do

537
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,379
code review code reviews and nightmare
everybody in this room knows how hard it

538
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:47,860
is to do

539
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,919
really good code review a specially when
you have your hospital element inside a

540
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:53,370
bit

541
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,770
potentially gonna be a time triggered a
revenge

542
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,910
triggered sub routine that you'll never
see in a static

543
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,890
basic overview you're not gonna see it
you have to have some sort of IPS

544
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,530
mechanisms going on these mobile devices

545
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,800
but in single-user non multi tasking
environments

546
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,490
K how do you pull that one off and have
any power and battery time left to use

547
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,660
them for

548
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,540
with some fundamental architectural plan
blems the way these all wes is are

549
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,720
constructed in with what we're trying to
do to them

550
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,170
so the perfect storm of security the
next 12 here is my pin is gonna be a

551
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,560
mobile unless we

552
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,030
really figure something out very very
quickly

553
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:37,190
because if we have $20 billion movies
things I am definitely were

554
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,700
now some people in the mobile space a
what we're gonna do

555
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,570
is containerized our date

556
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,180
we're gonna say and boxer welp that's
already has

557
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,370
an attractive sound to it but a show of
hands here how many have you in your

558
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,100
office and your clients

559
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,250
would you recommend that they put both
their business data

560
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:04,540
and their personal data on their saying
business device

561
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,910
this is what bring your own disaster is
about

562
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,820
that's what they're trying to do and
send boxing and containers Asian I'm not

563
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,980
a fan of because people want these
devices because they do the kinda cool

564
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,910
things

565
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,570
that for whatever version you like you
want you don't want a whole brand new

566
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,090
experience with a whole new email client
a whole brand new

567
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,900
browser experience and browsers are
super super easy to build aren't they

568
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,220
they never screw up

569
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,530
and i wanna have all Latin running like
a corporate data

570
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,040
under the trust factor is well that
there will never ever ever be a breach

571
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,040
of the container walls

572
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,570
so maybe count me as a paranoid security
guy

573
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,080
this is gonna happen to the container is
Asian

574
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,660
and application wrapping industry in
mobile so gonna happen in eight months

575
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,310
18 months or four years I

576
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,520
up but it's gonna happen because the
technology is moving too quickly it is

577
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,280
going to be new OS is we're gonna have
compatibility problems we've never seen

578
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,090
before

579
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,700
and we're going all out

580
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,460
for consumer vendors to run the whole
show

581
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,560
so in the future we got some more stuff
even worry about if I haven't scared you

582
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,210
get

583
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,370
some things that I actually sit around
and think about

584
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,780
and my wife's is why don't you just read
Harry Potter it a lot easier

585
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,960
but I actually like guinea pigs are some
other things that really bother me

586
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,100
and are we ever gonna have any privacy
again

587
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,480
of me enough there was an article today
and

588
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,200
Wall Street Journal something I was
reading this morning and

589
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,900
basically the argument is privacy was a
19th and 20th century concept

590
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,120
that has 0 value in a digital society

591
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,980
well I read that I figure while cheese I
got an awful lot of digital things I

592
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,250
don't want you see and I go out this
cool things I want my wife see an

593
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,870
oncologist

594
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:17,220
lot of visual things I don't want my
clients in and privacy

595
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,270
is absolutely fundamental with a 2-1
over at security function

596
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,540
and does comments came out of the US not
from over here

597
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,580
were like in Canada privacy has much
more fundamental value

598
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,090
then was ever really are cognizant in
the United States

599
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,200
so this bothers me that we have some
leaders in our country that are saying

600
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,460
why should we even bother with privacy
it doesn't matter

601
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,130
and I've got a problem with that gets
back to technical

602
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:50,510
and the human element issues these
things are cool

603
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,540
they finally figured out how the

604
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,490
wings are to be working the wings on a a
bird work

605
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,170
and that will watch talk to find him and
we're seeing a little helicopters the

606
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,150
trade shows are those all really really
cool

607
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,420
the miniaturization efforts that are
being led by

608
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,190
largely dark by the united states and
some other research organizations around

609
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,850
the world

610
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,720
are getting them down to the miniscule
size absolute miniscule size is so

611
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,500
when you're in a meeting very sensitive
meet with a client is a fly buzzing

612
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,280
around

613
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,670
to use wat what is it doing

614
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,210
is in a biological entity is an
electronic entity

615
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,990
what do we do so we know you're
inventing this stuff

616
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,200
and my question is water the plant
defenses

617
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,890
instead of waiting for the disaster what
are some of the planned defense and

618
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,010
other stuff

619
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,380
while there are a lot of places and they
say you cannot

620
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,570
videotape so I've got my little video
corner I've got my

621
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:57,530
this is not an iPhone it's a computer
search I got my computer fears

622
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,580
and my little fade over here and they'll
tell me when the red lights white tape

623
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,000
over the red light so I can see a video
taping

624
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,250
bought a building now is a pair of
glasses the look

625
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,370
more like somebody from the 1950s CCT
ceded lands

626
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,820
audio camera little ramen

627
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:20,420
some wifi back here how can somebody
possibly tell me to take off my classes

628
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,650
and Margaret Ford

629
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,470
when I'm in one of these environments
how does that affect its a private

630
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,070
meetings

631
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,910
of high government how does that affect
espionage how does it affect all the

632
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,270
other pieces of the spectrum of what
we've seen already fall apart the last

633
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,980
thirty years

634
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,980
with the new technologies that we know
are coming we don't have it sorted out

635
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,150
really really bothers me EMP and her I
am

636
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:49,650
gotten involved in this in the late
eighties cuz I'm not

637
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,130
my old engineering degree was an analog
and I really liked high-power stuff

638
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,880
could you could make things blow all

639
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,700
and that was kinda fun so got involved
to conserve the PMP what happens with

640
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,460
nukes cool off in the corresponding

641
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,980
damaged electronic so what have you and
at a conference I was running called in

642
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,060
for work on in Washington DC

643
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,410
I found the song geeky ciba 16 or 17
years old

644
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,640
the Sun oval watchin mafia

645
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,380
mobster from Brighton Beach Brooklyn in
New York

646
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,360
who had built a1 Tara lost

647
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,950
EMP polled singer

648
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:33,450
your abs as so we started shooting these
things off

649
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,350
down in Washington DC until we got a
phone call from the

650
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,510
FAA the air or they say a in people know
we were there

651
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,600
he said are you doing something you
shouldn't be no sir

652
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,120
don't know but I'm not my mama's

653
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,790
but we didn't blow up a whole buncha
stuff we have another gentleman do one

654
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,400
not quite as I'll hit you want to prove
that the technology has existed for over

655
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
120 years

656
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,120
so we took a piece a paper from Heinrich
hertz is

657
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,670
documentation experimentation in the
1880s rebuild it

658
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,240
exactly what we do use as a car battery
is that if you'll go far excels

659
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,400
and we were putting up 300 megawatt
polls is that we're eating up digital

660
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,770
cameras an old computers

661
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,690
my worry is this technology as you see
now is going to be deployed was entered

662
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:26,560
wrong defense is being deployed and 747
for the military

663
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,860
as massive warfare capabilities

664
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:35,060
when the bad guys get it whatcha gonna
do to your networks

665
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,620
do you have any Fox or defenses against
it

666
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,840
your senior leadership management
doesn't care

667
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,320
have never seen it will never happen
therefore it's not gonna

668
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,320
be worth worrying about that's the same
problem we've been having for the last

669
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,150
thirty years this stuff

670
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,720
is coming up absolutely coming and every
one of you in this room knows in a

671
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,930
intermittent problem is the worst
problem you can have

672
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:06,550
if it's broken I can fix it if it breaks
every so often with no conditions I can

673
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,380
relate to and I can build context out of

674
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:15,830
I'm screwed for and these weapons are
absolutely ideal for doing that

675
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:20,140
nanotechnology it absolutely astounds me

676
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,820
that would get me to build and release

677
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,590
some degree of intelligence

678
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,630
with swarming and chaotic theory that we
do not understand the ramifications

679
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:38,090
derivations 01 downstream replica
russians of what were created

680
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:42,260
we don't understand it we know that's
swarming sets from the original

681
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,030
fun Norman work in the 1940s automat of
theory

682
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,900
means I could have two simple
instructions and result

683
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,180
in a completely chaotic environment

684
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,130
but world that we live in certainly has
a lot more than two instruction sets

685
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,990
which means that the matter damage we
can create can be far greater

686
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,900
just out of curiousity and we don't
understand the nature of this

687
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,410
so we're gonna start deploying these
things whether it's inside our bodies

688
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,410
for health reasons yes that's a really
good go like

689
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,800
grabbed it but as a bad guy I'm sure I
can come up with an awful lot away sir

690
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,520
to her did as well but the technology is
going to become just like chemistry sets

691
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,140
when I was a kid I have a

692
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,590
56 years old little chemistry set the
first thing we build is hydrogen sulfide

693
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,860
right to clear out the room

694
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,280
bad guys gonna get a hold of this what
are they gonna do with it

695
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,120
I want you guys to figure that out ahead
of time

696
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,060
what are the bad guys gonna do with
nanotechnology

697
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,970
and how is a gonna help us serve how is
it going to hurt us

698
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:56,510
all these things i'm talking about. are
the sums up my fears these are things I

699
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,760
worry about

700
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,970
and unless I can get uploaded into a
computer sometime in the next 20 years I

701
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,960
prolly won't be around to see an awful
lot of these things

702
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,310
but it really bothers me and hopefully
some listings a bother you as well

703
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,860
and here's another one that few if you
might have been falling

704
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,240
anybody remember what happened in 1859
he returns in effect we just had started

705
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,930
building the United States

706
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,280
telegraph system those are some in
Europe as well that point

707
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,890
and there was a solar flare to shut down
the entire Telegraph industry

708
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,520
both in the US and in Europe for for
several weeks in fact

709
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,170
because nobody knew what the hell was
going on and that cause

710
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,200
massive communication problems mainly
that point

711
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,530
in order to be able to schedule trains
was the primary goal over to that point

712
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,720
so this was a one-off event but now of

713
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,230
in the last twenty years or so there
have been a number of miniature parents

714
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,120
and events

715
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,560
occurrence in Venice really nothing more
than a solar flare

716
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,010
but the ones that nasa ESA JPL

717
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,830
and the of solar the Sun experts are
predicting now

718
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,860
is a thing called the CME it for romance
injection

719
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,440
and so that'll give you a little bit of
the perspective here

720
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,600
now it's not so much that there's gonna
be a hunger fire 93 million

721
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,970
miles long its gonna hit the earth
that's not the word

722
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,910
the worry is that the CME has the
equivalent of several

723
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,800
billion nuclear bombs

724
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,260
worth of power yes

725
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,290
one of these goes off on the right angle
of the Sun and

726
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,510
we in the orbit are in the right place

727
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,840
what happens to this planet

728
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,160
that here is called a binary function a
church shuts off

729
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,490
yeah it's in with zero and a

730
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,580
so this is a legitimate thing that
they're forgive

731
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,980
so you're electronic engineers there are
some potential fixes or some defenses

732
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:05,230
and they're based upon time the this
summer are things we can talk about

733
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,980
but the big problem is they're talking
about the cost just have the satellite

734
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,250
so long

735
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,050
think how much of this planet now one za
let's say it doesn't hit the

736
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:15,880
Transformers on earth

737
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,860
let's say bill power grid does not just
completely snack food

738
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,470
let's say it's just Watson orbital NGO
SiC

739
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:30,020
what happens then are we prepared for it
again we're not thinking

740
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,340
enough about the technology and the
downstream replica russians

741
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,570
and then whether your clothes while fan
or not the some fascinating reading out

742
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:39,180
there

743
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,110
well as one called on intelligence Kors
while has a new one called building up

744
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,290
to a silicon brain i think is this title

745
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:50,260
syriza books as well on quantum
consciousness and merging

746
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,000
how the brain and electronics are gonna
be able to communicate and do things

747
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,170
and the singularity fundamentally Korean
clothes while serbs

748
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,560
are fundamentally Sankt by the year use
in 2035 there will be enough computing

749
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,410
power up

750
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:08,880
to be able to upload a brain into a
silicon object

751
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,410
now ignoring the spiritual and religious
at all those other connotation

752
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:18,020
do we want to as another question

753
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,130
pipe as we've seen from technology
throughout history if we can do it

754
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,200
we've done

755
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,240
order protections on his list the rise
of the machines was James Cameron

756
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,690
actually right

757
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,770
and you bring in and invoke your science
fiction

758
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,210
writers as well but it is a technology
that is

759
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,260
absolutely coming that from a
sociological standpoint

760
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,400
from a religious and spiritual
standpoint we have no

761
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,630
idea what's gonna happen

762
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:56,090
when the first guys brain gets uploaded
into a bunch of silicon

763
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,430
can we turn it off

764
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:06,060
will he feel Kane really interesting
questions the call

765
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,830
and of course I fear the unknown more
than anything

766
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,040
in order to make this work on offense 4
defense bases you three components

767
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,750
capability

768
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,440
will and intent and Scott were coming to
you guys

769
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,280
total lot of community meetings around
the world trying to get you guys to

770
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,130
vengeance on the crazy ways that I'm
thinking

771
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,760
about what is coming down line versus
just worrying about today's exploits

772
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,740
what's coming next what we need to
prepare for

773
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,660
and has a few ideas we can do or
something you know maybe we put its

774
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,890
completely back in full

775
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,760
billion controls on absolutely
everything that

776
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,720
is a user's hands anything down that
line nigga realize it's just not going

777
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,000
to happen

778
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,540
still best USB more protection I've ever
seen

779
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,450
anywhere use is called super glue

780
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,010
and it works every time up

781
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,110
in knowing who's saying what about 200
and 250

782
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:07,220
just give which asked to keep privacy in
the forefront of all of our security

783
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,290
think a

784
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:12,160
because they go absolutely hand in hand
his if what have you actually believed

785
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,130
you

786
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,830
had zero privacy at all-out anything in
your life

787
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:20,080
it's 100 percent transparent

788
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,860
was gonna change how you want it

789
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,300
in iraq was your fellow humans and your
fellow technologies

790
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,780
and it's very difficult first our heads
around with some other people in

791
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,920
washington house

792
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,110
okay some the stuff so we don't do we
don't teach

793
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:41,270
the new noobs in the field the history
they don't know

794
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:45,780
reference monitors are back from the
original work Bella partial model

795
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,800
I've been I've just a number PhD refuse
a version for cities around the world

796
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,580
a problem that I have is I'm not seeing
anything new in really really creative

797
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,800
cool stuff coming out of community

798
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,650
what's happening though it's not quite
organized not quite

799
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,480
ready for find time as it might come out
as an academic so from the academics in

800
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,560
sync up with residents work

801
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,180
they recaret everybody else is put into
a paper they get a PhD

802
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,900
and that was supposed to be considered
smart I can't fall up

803
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,350
they get the other guys know I've worked
out this great new mathematical formula

804
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:26,050
and must apply some work day and if I
can figure out why

805
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:30,000
please give me my PhD anyway we're
missing is the middle ground for the

806
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,230
practicality

807
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:34,960
the practicality the phiri the
understanding that it is not only

808
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,800
technical

809
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,240
having courage various disciplines
together make them

810
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,050
much more interdisciplinary related to
each other to make

811
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,130
ever have been stalled taping everything

812
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,660
for so damn long we forget that all this
stuff really really works together

813
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,300
and so on train over here that's me in
my backyard Tennessee

814
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,810
and I want to teach history I wanted
security history

815
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,060
it's not done even in summer the best
programs we don't race failure

816
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,380
corporations don't wanna hire you if you
have failed

817
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,800
then want to hire you if you've never
done anything wrong never had a bad

818
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,100
experience

819
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,500
I was a record industry fifteen years a
solution went down

820
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,310
collapsed around this gave me tremendous
insight and perspective on how to

821
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,660
deal when things go really long

822
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,020
so you may know the name jean shorts he
was a brilliant

823
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,220
Williams man security field United
States died last year

824
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,480
and he I'm gonna ice with his quote

825
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,710
he says after all the years I don't
understand

826
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:42,170
why don't have a self-propelled
operating system

827
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,810
beyond us why have we not strove strip
for

828
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:49,960
strove wisely not Heights to do that

829
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,600
because we go back to the vendor issues
backward compatibility

830
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,800
koreans French the home offers from IBM
the nineteen fifties Thank You Think

831
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Blue

832
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,480
got all their health care reconstructs a
bittersweet don't try

833
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,800
which by definition have chosen to fail

834
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,670
so we need to really try to sum up the
slack stopping to eat awesome have a

835
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:12,210
talk with a friend of mine later

836
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:15,230
there are some interesting models and
concepts on how to actually stop

837
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,220
de dos and the some assets functions and
some stuff you have to do

838
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,570
but also doesn't mean you have to re
architect the entire planet to do it

839
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,370
either

840
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:27,530
why are we looking at these things in
morphing open conferences outside the

841
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,920
community conferences that we have in
the past

842
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,220
and I really really real water hopefully
encourage you

843
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,430
to take a few with these ideas assume
you don't think they're all completely

844
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,270
wacko

845
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:45,450
at about exchange ideas about being
proactive in our defense

846
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:49,270
said it was kinda sittin back to see the
alternative is

847
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,470
that we chose to fail as well

848
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,330
I'd love to answer some of your
questions if I made you guys but I

849
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,550
absolutely awesome

850
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,660
I do have a couple more movies back here
for folks that are interested in having

851
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:07,660
a couple questions thank you very much

852
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:13,559
questions

853
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:17,229
anybody the gentleman that bank and then
your take

854
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:20,259
good think have a question for the good
one

855
00:54:20,259 --> 00:54:23,709
you going to lose sauce up at

856
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:27,539
the deal with

857
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:33,019
00 love I would not be nearly as
optimistic as you are being I think

858
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,390
if for two reasons sick related

859
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,559
I'm the first is in its most abstract
security

860
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,079
is framework in which civilization
flourish if

861
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,179
and security after extra-time

862
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:50,369
is always intention with Freeview

863
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:53,439
because you can have absolute security

864
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,969
in the real world but that would mean
sacrificing your freedom to act

865
00:54:57,969 --> 00:55:01,929
and so ET's very much in world
governments

866
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:05,400
to you be concerned about security I
think they have every legitimate right

867
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:05,969
to consider

868
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,209
but in the real world we know what in
security

869
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:13,839
X we don't really know security looks I
miss the same in the electronic well

870
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,059
because I'm not sure

871
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:18,339
of we want security because actually

872
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:22,819
without defined freedoms to limits what
security can end up picking

873
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,890
we can end up in a world where you know
what

874
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,219
you can jailbreak OST more you can't

875
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:32,929
you corporates move in and they climbed
and everything it's perfectly secure

876
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:37,219
pretty safe but a very dull boring very
limited will do I'm not sure we actually

877
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:38,299
want to live it

878
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:42,009
that's point one and I think the second
point I would make is that as an

879
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:42,939
industry

880
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:47,359
we fight all because we put in solutions
now I'm

881
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,409
a similar age to your snuff and I
remember when fire walls came in

882
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:57,519
right and you know what from my
perspective fireballs setback security

883
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,859
about fifteen years because since they
came in

884
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:04,679
every development organization I have
worked with over the many years goes

885
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:05,039
well

886
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,390
we're behind the fun we don't have to
fix anything anymore

887
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,099
so people have not thought about writing
secure code also that because the formal

888
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,140
takes care of it

889
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,900
but then when they wanted to do things
through the firewall instead of waiting

890
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,519
the right ports in designing secure
protocols in doing the job properly they

891
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,380
put everything 6 sorting

892
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,989
port 80 and the book bindery protocols
in 25 a stupid text based particle

893
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,069
inmates the user

894
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:32,689
soon conversation

895
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:36,909
I'm in complete agreement

896
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:40,589
your first point is the one that really
resonates with up me emotionally

897
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:43,669
is the interdisciplinary aspects of
things into

898
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:47,249
any issue ever have a chance to get into
somebody's release

899
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:52,159
more meetings at nine ten or fifteen
people YouTube English major a story and

900
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,109
I think de Cuba

901
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,039
doctors at all these different kinda
things and with the fridge

902
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,189
well-organized

903
00:56:57,189 --> 00:57:00,400
they hey they've of bringing a good
facilitator

904
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,269
and he's been two-and-a-half days
drinking golfing packing throwing

905
00:57:04,269 --> 00:57:08,719
darts and coming up with answers and
their absolute ball

906
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,400
important to get something is completely
different set of views because within

907
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,949
our own community while we may be

908
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:19,769
Louis part about a lot of stuff we also
have to admit we're also very myopic

909
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:24,079
about our view of the universe other
comments or questions

910
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,229
you get me for that those categories

911
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:30,819
I'm not sure if this is a comment or
question but it occurred to me when you

912
00:57:30,819 --> 00:57:32,150
were talking earlier about

913
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:37,829
at the sea on that we might be suffering
a kind of cultural Malays from

914
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,279
her mutual assured destruction period
that we lived under

915
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:46,049
as a species water for what Matt

916
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:49,239
of I don't have a

917
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:52,799
free so therefore you're all not

918
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,579
all culturally like that such with a
good thing

919
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:03,019
why don't people give a shit I mike got
reaction twice I talk with us a great

920
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:03,479
deal

921
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:07,880
is because the up the concert defensive
gratification is too big Jeff

922
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,529
specification I won't be able to tune
out the website X 13 seconds slower I'm

923
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,640
going on it's bad

924
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,650
ought never to which is

925
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,509
another aspect about the is the bad guys
feel sick kids for experimenting

926
00:58:20,509 --> 00:58:24,269
I was a kid you know you do something
stupid the physical demands

927
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:29,130
somebody wrapped around the head any
solvent you so you saw the results of

928
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,469
the consequences today

929
00:58:30,469 --> 00:58:33,839
kids we don't teach the consequent
management when you can physically see

930
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:34,839
the results

931
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,890
and those are two components at Happy

932
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,249
I guess I would never have thought about
virtually assured destruction

933
00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:45,719
as being part of that another that's why
we bring sociologists into these

934
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:46,589
discussions

935
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,739
a sociologist your day is better for
drinks later

936
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:56,739
a low-budget any other comments we have
10 minutes and 22 seconds

937
00:58:57,499 --> 00:59:04,499
thanks Patrick you can schedule is beer
cups AG

938
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,130
you talked a lot about taking people's
weapons away

939
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,759
now I found interesting because it
through a lot of parallels between

940
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:16,640
personal defense and dating someone to
acting weapon that way

941
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,739
now you're allowed to defend yourself
because your life is

942
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:25,380
a in half your direct physical integrity
that's why you're allowed to defend

943
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,189
yourself

944
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:30,269
now I do you talking about you defending
your infrastructure

945
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:34,569
by acting and other infrastructure there
if you are having the legal framework

946
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:38,130
for the government to directly pick
someone spent slime

947
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:41,659
how about automatic of Medicine

948
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:46,630
tripping machines that are run on skated
ICS inside a hospital's

949
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:53,630
that those go down so the you have a
bunch very sick and worked at people

950
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,659
okay you raise about books interpret
things further

951
00:59:56,659 --> 01:00:01,159
your infrastructure just got asked if
when you attack and infrastructure you

952
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:02,579
need of a new law

953
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:06,039
not the primary but you need to look at
the downstream consequences

954
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:09,539
results of what occurs of Ike Turner of

955
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:14,849
be are the sludge pumps at the Orleans
what's gonna happen in three months

956
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:18,539
everything it doesn't have an immediate
effect you need to look at things

957
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:21,619
and I have a summary things to come by
for heavily on time

958
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:25,369
what happened short term long term
visits like smoking right

959
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:29,339
I have three cigarettes 2012 if I have
300 cigarettes a day for seventy years

960
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:30,819
you're fucked

961
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:34,029
so you gotta understand the downstream
applications over

962
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:37,759
and then look at other cause and effect
as well because there is a we nothing is

963
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,849
isolated

964
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:42,489
and if I tag and infrastructure how is
that gonna spread out

965
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:45,949
and have other affects how was a good be
feedback

966
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:49,079
that's going to come back and hit me in
the face again because it's something

967
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,539
that was unproductive not known

968
01:00:50,539 --> 01:00:54,019
down there but are so I at the end of
the day

969
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:57,789
I think the rule should be the same and
I'm not successfully about kill people

970
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:01,119
I'm suggesting that we have a
proportional response

971
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,189
legal proportional response methodology
work

972
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:08,029
by officers weapon systems is one
suggesting I think between

973
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:11,549
technology community and legal community
that should be one of the first things

974
01:01:11,549 --> 01:01:12,719
that we do

975
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:16,150
in the next couple years

976
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:20,479
yes fight now officially one minute
overs with your fault

977
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:25,989
got a yet

978
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:29,589
easy yet like you just how far it can
you go in

979
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:32,719
and and seeing yes that's offensive or

980
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,479
that Trenton spices because she said yet
detect the SCADA systems

981
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:40,229
any in there medicine industry

982
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:43,779
the canyon and also state like it in a
very

983
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:47,859
them for example over Russia's will
deliver way the ball

984
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:51,709
for oil to us said that brings a us are
in dire

985
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:55,109
economy and/or life in danger effect

986
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:58,679
is it down allowed to protect them
because it's just a given

987
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:01,949
staking their weapon when he's lots and
point to you

988
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:06,099
how far can you go on us we have had
discussions beginning in the pentagon

989
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,979
believe it or not liking 92 or 93

990
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:12,699
and it echoes of military concept very
very fair

991
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:17,889
also in that if or a soldier soldier
already on the site does one thing what

992
01:02:17,889 --> 01:02:20,259
is the response proportional response

993
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:23,489
what out escalating it from the other
side

994
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,919
so the first aspect of it is actually
fusion

995
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:30,349
understanding where it came from that
has to be done

996
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:33,369
to a very high low preferably minimum of
26

997
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:36,799
before you do anything else the other
thing I put up there

998
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,479
wanna final words is intent what is the
intent

999
01:02:40,479 --> 01:02:44,489
of times we've all seen it that
something goes wrong it was like of shit

1000
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:46,329
sorry my bad like that

1001
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:51,479
and things happen see me to understand
the intent as well as the attack vectors

1002
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:55,719
before you can make any sort the
termination and there are procedures

1003
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:59,299
that have been developed something well
within the US military

1004
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:02,709
that has not been commercialized jet and
maybe our God knows where they're going

1005
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:03,829
to go at this point

1006
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:09,309
where we should be having some similar
types of technologies available to us

1007
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:13,869
to be able to do attribution intent
we've seen it was a lot of the ABC's

1008
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:15,559
above the data studies have come out a
bit

1009
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:19,109
really good mandates that he's been
really really good and we're starting to

1010
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:22,519
learn how to collect the data do the
data mining at the fed those that were

1011
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,909
still in the very early days but

1012
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,889
and nothing I'm suggesting here please
do not get the idea that I ask

1013
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:32,380
any easy questions or the threading easy
answers

1014
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:35,809
I don't think there or are I know my
time is up

1015
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:38,009
thank you so much I got a couple movies
for you guys
