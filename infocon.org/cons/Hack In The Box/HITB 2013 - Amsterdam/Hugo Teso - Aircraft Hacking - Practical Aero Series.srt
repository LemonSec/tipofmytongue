1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,690
well

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,690
well

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,730
yes thank you

4
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:26,710
I would afternoon to all I fell for
coming

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,749
I say she say and my name is over

6
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:33,420
and for the last the for years and a
half more or less

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,850
he's been working on our a personal
research involving

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,220
are aviation security today I would like
to share with you some of their results

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,620
of this research

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,370
so that's cool and missus and not

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,420
the typical slight what I explain

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,790
for my by a teddy is to explain what I
might

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,570
I think that's important for what I'm
gonna talk about

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,620
because on one hand I'm at the CD
security receptor I some other

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,710
most of the people sitting there are but
on the other hand

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:09,690
I'm also commercial pilots for the last
five years

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,040
and I E need both of the say

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,130
knowledge in order to face these
research

19
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,850
even being commercial pilot I have to
study an art form any time

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,690
and I know that too DB understand and
perhaps he's famous and the inner

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,370
workings

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,120
soul to take into account that for the
rest of the day of the talk

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,650
s most of the concepts will be new arm

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,310
I would be a won't be able to explain
everything get the agenda for today

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,380
I've divided the talking to different
parts the fish

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,490
the first one we will see how to get

27
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,570
and when I believe this on systems on
board the opening

28
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,880
and after that we will see how to use
those whenever it is in order to

29
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,119
exploit those systems are more the
opening

30
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,580
just before beginning I know by the end
of the start most of day

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,140
a subjects will be not properly explain
but they have

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,709
bank or strains asset FSA are quite
different from you this and I'm sure

33
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:09,099
that

34
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,620
not everybody here has all the
background the knowledge necessary know

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,830
that understand everything

36
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,310
and also be costly to see if the recent
I cannot giving

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,340
get into the details on for example the
vulnerabilities or the exploits

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,420
because most of them not to say all of
them honestly you

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,550
and ending to be fact arsov

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,239
okay so let's bad in 251

41
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,250
where we will see how to how to get

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,130
does not have any peace and how
everything started everything started as

43
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,720
they say

44
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,890
many years ago with one question and the
question was a

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,140
if I E will be able to compare for
security

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,630
from the security perspective and
everything into a computer

47
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,920
so get some of them are systems

48
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,940
try to find one and abilities developed
the

49
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,980
exploits and ASI what

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,120
may be able to the 16 plated two more
systems the question to the sensor

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,840
worse Jess and many yes late there

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,849
missus brief mop of

53
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:19,160
the main topics I have had been covering
are I'm coming right now or I plan to

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,180
give winfrey said to on this time

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,840
are as you can see I have the body that
I'm better at Victor's targets

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,530
on they common faces of an attack from
all these

57
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,019
today with just and talk about few

58
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,280
points are of you see stains I

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,980
few targets and a few problems not
everything can be covered

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,370
okay thing take into accout this is what
we are gonna see today

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,620
give up a review for today yes I'm

62
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,569
I half organized adding to the common
facie some fun attack

63
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,450
which are me scoring
information-gathering expedition

64
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,440
post expedition funny story we do so
well known protocol

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,610
are both a DSP for information gathering

66
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,870
on the targets we will see it will
reduce acres

67
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm for expedition was with reduced a
custom reaching the airplane

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,739
and exploit on your system when you have
a lead these about

69
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:17,799
we see the post expedition options we
week-and-a-half

70
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,090
so let's start with a brief introduction
on

71
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,620
ATSB though I administration NEA people
in the car

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,770
small Boston that I ADS B stand for

73
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,110
that ultimate independence Williams no
cast

74
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,889
its kind of our way they're supposed to
do it that is being deployed right now

75
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,210
around the world against a group
information ass

76
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,350
position velocity speed identification

77
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,419
and information to air traffic control
and manage mean back around

78
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,760
a DSB facade that the rate or less ups

79
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,770
of 1 gigabit per second and we will be

80
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,270
using that in order to locate and float
targets

81
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,180
on a map let's say it's like and AARP

82
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,560
being or are discoveries can pick and a

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,740
we've and my destino which after a fight
it are there

84
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,800
okay talking about it yes we security
that CC

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,090
based not on I am so you can find almost
every kind of attack you can find on

86
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,580
on common protocols arm

87
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,620
back and by the end on their preference
has lied we sit where you can see

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,120
innings to other documents that explain
on those setbacks

89
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,380
cocaine said we will do that another two

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,770
game against target selection and we
will do say three different sources for

91
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,660
this paper

92
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,800
first we've reduced public databases

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
arm the people getting a VSP data and
shining

94
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,370
are with us local they'd that getting so
well defined radio

95
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,370
and I'm we will be working all the time

96
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,520
on this research with me at all perhaps
with you later

97
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,160
Paso wey also take a ATSB input and
output of the serbians

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,460
that's all about eight years the
security and how to get

99
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,259
the targets on a map came after that and
I will reduce acres

100
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,770
a casa it's a stands for a graphic
communications

101
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,479
everything and reporting system and it's
kind of far

102
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,110
in this price like Gangnam email C span
between

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,669
round and airplanes and also

104
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,139
meeting deadlines ATC almost anybody
more than any nation can you take us to

105
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,220
communicate between them

106
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,660
O'Kane and we will induce that internet
to

107
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,440
gay fag kind of over the existing
fingerprinting

108
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,990
of the selected K targets bites ass

109
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,160
getting as much information as possible
by getting

110
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,259
a car state that we will try to get
detail information

111
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,400
phone on the available time its

112
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,530
meeting a guy security will have exactly
the same one s own

113
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,449
a BSB people are many military

114
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,410
are working on some secure
implementation a Cubs nothing deployed

115
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,630
as far as a No

116
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,360
some airlines have tried to develop REM
demand own kind of security like that

117
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,810
when I safe here

118
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,139
to be honest I think I that cannot be
considered security most

119
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,350
anymore but you can fine if you just
that information

120
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,650
from public databases as happens with a

121
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,690
ABS meet a lot of people just getting a
car say communications and

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,880
shutting them local they'd ever you're
seeing somebody find review again

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,139
and of course with a reference that's
what we have on our

124
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,250
reducing okay finally we got to be in a
cuss hair

125
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,810
I have to mention at the ground service
providers which are too big companies

126
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,690
that offer worldwide coverage

127
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,110
of a car say

128
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,160
related services with you later on back
to our need to read more about that

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,190
talking that's a brief introduction on
those two protocols that

130
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,150
I'm not the target of the stalled test
some resources I we won

131
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,180
we went using other two getting to the
the opening by the end of

132
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,330
these two faces we will see we will have
a map offer but that every level targets

133
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,569
we have the information on most of them

134
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,020
so we can try to guess which one are his
wall for our purposes

135
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,360
now the FMS the fight management system
is they are more system we are gonna

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,060
take it today there are many of them but
we are here to do it today we're going

137
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,380
to focus on that one

138
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,509
I just really it's gone see sting on to

139
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,210
units components a computer you need
that's the one you say or

140
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,389
I have both and you know I'm on the left
and which is just inside a day Friday

141
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,470
can you don t need

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm are you find republicans will
display unit

143
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,399
which is the one with the keyboard and a
onto a screen

144
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,060
bring them back it's used by the AM by
not say

145
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,680
another to enter data and get some
feedback

146
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,890
on their effective for management system
operations

147
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,839
okay I also I need another MH of the
electronic at one of their

148
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,060
primary flight displays of the evening
you know all the screens that you can

149
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,950
issue on

150
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,620
common compete on the openings this is
one of them and some other data and

151
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,779
output by the flight management system
can also be shown there

152
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,670
to the fibers okay I

153
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,430
the FMS brief introduction are the goal
our goal is to exploit

154
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,089
the FMS 10 more system the eight years
to use

155
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,370
a car's communications to upload data
into the FMS

156
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,670
and they are as we say later many
different data types that we can

157
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,010
try to send them to the FMS to fight to
are

158
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,480
find when abilities they different
upload options with half

159
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,120
are so what's the fair so far defined
radio for

160
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,230
local area at targeting or

161
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,540
down service providers to try to call
their one white parents

162
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,600
okayed the path to exploit this always
eats get the aircraft Colt

163
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,130
set for minorities all the exploits and
then

164
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,550
try to limit them for that i'm forced to
safety security and a beer free some

165
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,260
spied on

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,040
half napping up at my apartment we jus a
bit for the environment

167
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,150
to set up based on airplanes that we use

168
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,180
a actual 3 I'll boat software and
hardware

169
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,470
from different airplanes so how to get

170
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,470
these for 121 mean look difficult and
expensive phone in the beginning but

171
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,630
he's not that much

172
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,860
there are different resources we can Fe
we can move tried to

173
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,449
to do something to get the state a this
for one so far for example they

174
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,790
always helpful EV if you go to Ebay and
search for a pain

175
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,920
see stems from morsi's games Graham CFS
these things

176
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,440
with hundreds of them you can always go
to some

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,310
scrapping like Russian ones when you
can't ask pointed to an airplane and

178
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,820
point to this is 10-2-1 on

179
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,070
the contest even ask for our and repeal
of ripping and you can have almost

180
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,720
everything

181
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,260
inside I also love to I

182
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,670
men's title of a Salesman because of
their buy and use

183
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,650
products that are not the ever been
seized ames my

184
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,529
themselves by the interact with those
systems will see later that they also

185
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,060
can help us in a little bit

186
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,130
that information if not be a problem
itself and also

187
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,790
is a manufacturer's are secure and

188
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,209
sold you cannot get the car what they'd
only from them this somewhat early for

189
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:12,540
them

190
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,089
you can always face the third party
vendors which usually

191
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,620
half less security and their even into

192
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,120
said as much as possible so maybe also
use for

193
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,290
finally as always there is a fully
assessed of remember use are a good

194
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,570
source of information

195
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,470
to to try to get if not the hardware
itself maybe after one update

196
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,529
you can always get into either a
specialized form

197
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,709
a of the problems are looking for an
same

198
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,430
ass happened to me once yeah I I got
these

199
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,540
brother by eBay got the new version so
they don't give me the update of the

200
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,490
people and so I'm completely fuck up

201
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,930
southern yellow another some says yeah
exactly the same happened to me and

202
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:53,970
completeness of

203
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,780
II don't worry I will help you I have
the femur major looking for

204
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,959
and you can have if you were a bit of
and after sees them

205
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,640
which is always I would metal okay

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,819
some examples for example you can find
on our

207
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,939
eBay are funny whether freight
management computer for

208
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:15,550
four hundred dollars me may seem quite
expensive which later

209
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,970
on their temples a cheaper like the
spelling system for

210
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,220
task fifteen dollars i sorry 85 the last
week

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,100
we get cheaper arm for example

212
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,250
and you can always had face and another
approach

213
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,240
which is the training software that's
what I learned to love this is fine

214
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,949
because

215
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:40,410
I wonder if and specification of the
product

216
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,819
they always try to give you as much
information as possible about 24 due to

217
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,870
by these so far so you can see see
things like

218
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,839
our solution uses the same shove what
that the issues by the aircraft

219
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,020
the baby at trial aired on when
Ponting's FMS

220
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,850
usually this training solutions are
cheaper also

221
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,260
the same happened for example to
Honeywell high resolution graphics are

222
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,000
combined with

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,350
actual aircraft pole to create an
environment of dreams

224
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,980
fine and contamination also you can see
here on ackhouse

225
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,770
a a prof and management unit for just
then the last

226
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,800
on evening I got that one by the way

227
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,750
at the only problem is that it's K pay
me and it's hard to look at it sent back

228
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,900
to Europe and Japan

229
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,010
for sure fine ass on way to to get that
delivered to you

230
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,199
back in Europe or whatever you need I

231
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,930
another example of another sub were in
this case for the telling someone issue

232
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,060
a simulation

233
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,430
a funny way they also say is I you know
the arcing

234
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,430
incorporates about 95 percent of the
outfile

235
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,089
tea and you need to you someone so on
our product training product with real

236
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,400
at being systems quote okay

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,860
and for her one for example the first
away but for the

238
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,620
air freight management system course
these 10 K can you see

239
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,970
I am the top I got it from my game

240
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,209
shop in Ohio for ten dollars

241
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,180
because they thought it was kind of our
looking for the Microsoft Flight

242
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,449
Simulator

243
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,329
that was not anymore on sale so I the
zest Senate for me for ten dollars

244
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:14,850
that's how we get the first flight
management system called

245
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,250
okay fight I know we have there is so
far with have the hardware

246
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,420
for a couple minutes meaning computer
and

247
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,260
units for flight management computer and
on their systems that we can

248
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,540
decided we need not replicate that whole

249
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,910
yet stopping eating more or less I'm
weekend set up by one lap

250
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,250
for example in missing in my case I use
are

251
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,020
a laptop with in Willmar secretive set a
framework

252
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,709
I E develop at that using I don't see
types

253
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,730
talks with this 04 are also each

254
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,850
aircraft I E typing r-calf I set up

255
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,939
house its own so when he finds radio
communication

256
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,390
to simulate the a DSP in a communication
small from Boeing and

257
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,250
ongoing and no quarrel and in order to
make

258
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,670
more realistic in my domain all their
beautiful airplanes

259
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,390
iraqgate getting have actual we r flight
they tack

260
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,069
from and I computer running a the
explain facing nato

261
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,069
which is a really good friends 18 or and
with a plugin you can get

262
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,930
a and connect those get on airplanes
with it so if they are

263
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,010
you can we make them fly to see how they
make a film on testing ground

264
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,650
not useful for for example the
expedition imposed expedition insulated

265
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,790
this is a picture of our usually my life
is not that went on a nice but for the

266
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,760
future I

267
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,949
I'm probably gonna be you see these are
laptop with a explain this

268
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,699
he to Applebees the one running explain
any the laptop is the one that

269
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:46,360
usually takes care of all this what
defined radio a staff

270
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,410
and the small one I just really fast
they

271
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,439
which have to make amends are so much so
that means

272
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,260
army 22-yarder to also you can see some

273
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,870
out the pilots and other however like it
was going to be a just to run

274
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,390
separately on their systems and
components player when he backed

275
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,860
on the double vag MCS morning yes we
need we say receiver

276
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,380
and being a US IP Paso what you think
radio

277
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,939
ready for in 10 okay so we have

278
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,970
I was and upset of weekend setup you to
that means using

279
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,449
we have called the aircraft we have real
communication if we can just seems so

280
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,720
what defined radio and we have a lot in
my domain

281
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,220
to try to find when you have any peace
to the print everything ready

282
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,910
its try to find when it is OK so

283
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,949
but I will have to face another to find
someone to meet this from the flight

284
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,000
management system

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
computer meaning is that are have many
different Victor

286
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,299
approaches retarded defended the fact
that and you have no teeth into the FMS

287
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,459
yeah acres there are many fed management
system manufacturers

288
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:52,500
each of them has motives and
deformations I'm

289
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,510
so we have to try to perform as much as
possible of them architectures

290
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,000
I just when you're we are how what you
see is kind of I would be CEO is the

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,530
stems

292
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,520
I one lap is using different growth but
also be anyone this is Tammy left I'm

293
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,429
thinking if I miss

294
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,569
be of high water we have quote but
combined for a

295
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,740
the x86 platform and i watch that's
funny I don't know if you ever tried to

296
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,679
the reverse engineering on my eye on any

297
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,750
a binary i det any

298
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,919
I gotta I I'm and therefore that because
I had no idea how that law which

299
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,660
was another problem with Hafeez there
but if system

300
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,559
I uses real-time operating system really

301
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,919
eyes some mainly for the all their
devices they use at

302
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,090
the so-called digital in you know
breathing system which is

303
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,419
I know they're real-time operating
system developed together by ease

304
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,500
if I'm not wrong nasa and funny way back
in the 70s

305
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,100
an on the most modern devices they are
moving to other

306
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,429
real-time operating systems like
networks am

307
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:56,140
also ask I wanna meet the exploits are
gonna be delivered

308
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,190
forty acres I will have to take into
account that a cut faster

309
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,850
delay I mean it to the lay of the land
seconds Mona

310
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:10,400
approximately nay size of document I for
from a company such should be around 220

311
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,650
characters and you can use after sixteen
of them that will be

312
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,700
mister whether are have been the flight
manager and a cash management unit on

313
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,070
the

314
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,799
neoprene and this for another to the
body exploit you have to take that into

315
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,220
account after that the fuel

316
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,510
taken to love the a cups incoming
messages you can test

317
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,020
forget about the spot unease for the
explain delivery in the first stage of

318
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,570
the bailout

319
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,090
you have to take that into account also
looking at the name

320
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,520
images you have to you see that the a
have Smith cities

321
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,730
at this link or eat so even if you

322
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,919
be buried or a customer sites many as
you suggest that you have to take into

323
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,490
account that you have to in Co that

324
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,200
know that too II blow that's into the
airplane

325
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,590
and after that maybe because it done
will be tax forms of all

326
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,679
antonin which is our final system in
this case flight management system

327
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,280
ok so which kind of a tech and we send

328
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,870
these graphic here I'm are offered

329
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,120
to ask my seat that went to a diff we
see their I shows

330
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,190
up some of the standout information

331
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,880
same and received by an opening doing a
normal flight

332
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,020
or the faces of 5 from taxi to landing

333
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,870
and I'm again tax your key are you can
see me too

334
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,120
aircraft I that's what we are interested
in because that means the epic the

335
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,030
formations

336
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,190
will send to the opening okay you can
see that

337
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,669
a lot of information each will Saint an
exchange between

338
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,210
airplanes and ATC and traffic control

339
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,929
and doing and on my flight but during
takeoff and landing which have the most

340
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,470
critical faces of the flight also even
if you see a lot of fun for me

341
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,919
I'm information being sent here take
into account that this is just

342
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,820
in Norman operations and the normal
communications are

343
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,220
also doing exceptional conditions
additional information is being sent

344
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,049
and lanes also send and receive
information using a car's

345
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,650
also can be used a maintenance agreement
also use a car's

346
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,559
on on information that can be used a lot
of information can be

347
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,039
cameos mean that a packed day so face
it's quite

348
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,230
meek says it one of those in stock

349
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,720
passing or whatever the fabled perceive
you okay

350
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,990
now II it's a time for our demo

351
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,539
of the spit on environment I have set up
I will show you the informer

352
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,760
freeware half a specific mission for the
San

353
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,100
development resettle them

354
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,309
here okay these he said being a
framework

355
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:44,350
disease that affects ap you can see on
the left that are many types

356
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,660
networking Caminos we've seen exploiting
and

357
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,580
things plane season but no one the one
that you won't find a name

358
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,600
for becoming a ball are there something
former here you can see the IP addresses

359
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,570
of all the

360
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,679
computers that set up my laptop okay

361
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,000
they want to show before here that with
half

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,400
many terminals is one actually showing
on the time being received

363
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,520
be a by explain too late or and being
sent to the need for a place to make

364
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,120
them flight

365
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,440
okay behalf another time another with

366
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,360
ratted tool listening tour that I use in
order to regress antenatal

367
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,480
many the back this offer and the cold
while

368
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,919
sending them you just crafted messages

369
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,100
and on the last one I task I know if we
be able to read that

370
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,429
let's wait until I highlight that yep

371
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,000
at this is just that comment from dove
their post expedition Asian

372
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,809
that we will see later and I just have
to always have to me know

373
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:44,830
to try to manage their pencil and

374
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,140
expatriate on the racing top with half
are some

375
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,130
Colt open for static analysis I had to
try to

376
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,120
follow what's going on to conceive the
form shown same 4646

377
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,740
midsections you know my stuff okay it's
of these binary

378
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,150
as you can see here this is Hannah my
win this memory

379
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,150
because he's just one of those boats
that yours

380
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,549
really difficult but half being wanted
into the x86 platform

381
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,049
okay exploiting top a jewish many for
them

382
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,809
passing staff you can see that i five
acres

383
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,230
nade different a

384
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,590
probes a half your selected the acres
and

385
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,620
each of these fields will be money fight
and send him to the

386
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,409
at 11:30 okay now back on the bottom
line the plane's one

387
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,760
on the right you will see that we have
three types eight years me

388
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,110
acres and exploitation on these a DSP

389
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,299
actually if I know we are seeing some
apims being other

390
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,679
make sure what defined radio on
developing and area

391
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
and the information we can gather by
Tess is anything I can be tough

392
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,980
abst we can also face the solidification

393
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,270
that you can find on internet that
allows you to have a broader coverage

394
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,179
in this case well white more from simi
arm

395
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,929
so we can also face additional targets
after that we

396
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,890
going to be a car stock once we have
selected some targets

397
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,380
we are not selecting we have targets bat
are

398
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,940
anyway you feel we can see information
acres information gathered by

399
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,820
I think the BBC's and also by our so
what defined radio

400
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,000
are I mean I don't you can see messages
I

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,030
halfs change the names to keep need a
bit of safety

402
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,270
and than a mouse that point and it's now
facing those two airplanes

403
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,559
are a plane's that are being money to
buy this application

404
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,659
at the longer they are money to rate
them best information we have them

405
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:49,820
and I'm and why I get information I tend
to classify them in blue

406
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,320
so I don't have exploit for them our
rates should be potentially

407
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,789
when I want to my exploits okay if we
double click on one of them the red ones

408
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:02,760
we can see also the formation of the
serb mean specific opening on a map

409
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,179
as we saw in your is it just an example

410
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,320
this is the explanation top the final
top

411
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,510
here we can see on the left that would
have created three different

412
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,030
meter airplanes Colts and runs 12 in
free

413
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,340
we different five minutes man old

414
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,169
okay and on the right we can see a
different option so we've

415
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,809
air some data and tools to work with for
example these monies to

416
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,020
I am know when that we are seeing now
it's for for

417
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,760
handling the FMS you gonna start stop
after misquote

418
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,140
we can a sweet see now 88 with an excess

419
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,600
exciting I'll eat or summit the date
that the for missus loading

420
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,120
I saw have kind of a cheat sheet of this
system some more fun these to reset

421
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,100
some of them test two don't get lost as
you can see is quite complex

422
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,700
and Justin guess I'll have to explain on
your laptop just for a quick test I can

423
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,960
assure I'm the

424
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,049
five years in 18 on the same laptop are
with

425
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:03,039
7.7/10 for example to feed a total any
of the middle innings

426
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,409
also will have some good information on
webs

427
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:09,940
are before that we are so hot on the

428
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,899
API solve the binary so that we can try
to contact me 75

429
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:18,409
options for the week of this is a kind
of playmaking

430
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:21,700
play you can see a profile of flying
over between right now

431
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,200
please keep in mind that in this erratic
flight that he's doing right now

432
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,830
just a money to run for real-time me to
leave what's the been doing

433
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,509
speed attitude how to do it and things
like that the Shasta monitor

434
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:36,940
okay and actually he's frame Frank on
from

435
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,309
mistake us are top are also asked to we
have a lot of because message is Jess

436
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:42,749
classified so we can

437
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,080
to let the wind and you know we will
have kind of a template

438
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,470
of funny getting a such related to
uproot clearance or whatever

439
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,980
as we can modify and five percent and
see what happens

440
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,210
okay finally everything on NBC SaskTel
fine

441
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,009
when I mean it is on events so if I
press play

442
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:04,769
I A get I every other SMS quotes running

443
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:08,110
I will see if I know how to afloat
million note

444
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,039
operas of onset of a crash offer every
other SMEs

445
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,899
system so we tested the the SMS to load
some but I have prepare for them

446
00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:20,759
and you can see that there if it
automatically crashing

447
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,470
with half their 41 41 41 classic
forty-one

448
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,090
are oppressed after that we have to
taking talk to it

449
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,840
look if this will have an 86 play
tomorrow or not okay this is the end of

450
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,799
day

451
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,590
for the first time by the end of this
demo week of the

452
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,419
is gonna buy domain running coat they of
the firm s

453
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:44,159
and literally this so now it's time for
parts or

454
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,519
thank you find it where we will see how
to deliver

455
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,019
these exploits in 20 the airplane

456
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:54,090
are with the limitations we have has
we're not talking about

457
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,320
someone IP protocols at aviation
printable

458
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,370
camps SAT told before they

459
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,120
there are the so-called a ground service
providers two main players around the

460
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,480
world

461
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,499
to sitar and adding affairs while

462
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:10,799
eats many folk use on European field

463
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,149
the second one mainly focus on the north
american America

464
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:17,519
but now for the last yes they are
fighting in there you have to conquer

465
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,860
the world and so

466
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
they are abating almost all of them you
know they're

467
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,580
you know the country's as you can see
here they offer services related to

468
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,159
almost

469
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,850
every aspect of aviation you name it

470
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,580
and you have seen she thought for sure
when you have to fill your boarding pass

471
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,590
before boarding the plane with Cesc fell
over on the machine

472
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,370
its reading your boarding pass and if
you take a closer look

473
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,039
a for example why when you leave need
Amsterdam I

474
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,990
the airport which he seat Armenian maybe
I think laws allow iraq

475
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,210
okay alsop the two players and a

476
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,230
among other things offer to airlines
general aviation to anybody that want to

477
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,999
pay that

478
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:00,330
I said base to and be able to endeavor

479
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,340
and receive a cuss communication for the
openings

480
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,019
off their feet how cocaine these people

481
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,610
are fighting I say say it for the world
domination on

482
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,529
aviation said missus so may have to
offer the best services

483
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,509
among other things they are fair all
these at the CES

484
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:22,190
methods in order to a send and receive
and manage

485
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,259
or your feet by using acres from you
mean Bryan Stow desktop applications web

486
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:29,090
applications mobility

487
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,940
and if you don't I have enough you can
even develop your own

488
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,649
SDK which is good because if you try to
use their applications

489
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:40,419
you're gonna find the same problem you
look at only send standard a guesstimate

490
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,450
to see messages

491
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,210
if you want to send something not to
spend their let's say two to governor me

492
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,830
that you would have to develop your own
interface

493
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,249
for example the STK a comes in handy for
that this is expected of

494
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:55,499
again from the same government of Sita

495
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,919
okay also with of this or what they find
radio we can do stacked

496
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,289
Internet over a two-game more detail

497
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,799
are information on the local any I we
are sitting

498
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,220
because I think that the BCS usually I'm
not that then cover all day

499
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,029
that round so are for their local area
defense

500
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,649
you can do so one fan radio with a pic I
wanna so work to monitor

501
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,320
either arm communications using a

502
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,330
yes he or acres must have you out for
you know what Sasso what defined radio

503
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:26,970
yes

504
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,340
says he's been where instead of trying
to buy coming to buy

505
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,690
a lot of different if I what devices for
each of the communication want to work

506
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,320
with

507
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,720
his ass fryer have to buy one or two the
basis and

508
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,240
by programming you can implement all
their specific needs for these

509
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,299
communication

510
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:46,970
for example the 18 years had QC eight
years on the Peter de caus at people on

511
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,399
an essential for anybody from and for
programming

512
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,440
a useful can you rate your are flabby
MATLAB all these

513
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,619
but in a different according to my phone
bat I many here you can see a picture of

514
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,049
an open-source available implementation

515
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,720
draft are far better if you want to
college of I make us the colour

516
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,509
soul and so I defined radio it's already
working for atheism year

517
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,429
reception actually for acres if you want
to hire for

518
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,769
sending availability is taking too funny
to be a legal

519
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:21,789
but you will have also developed by your
for

520
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,389
so I we can have whatever it is

521
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:29,139
will have the exploits with half and
many ways to reach the airplane

522
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:33,789
I and we can deliver or exploit so
common post exportation

523
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:38,110
use our questions which that are going
to have to consolidate

524
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,950
all on the target established the way
communication to interact with target

525
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,110
and try to expand to other systems okay
and after that go back to this company

526
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,220
stuff again for time for as you can see
there

527
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,730
day new Boeing 787

528
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,820
in a Hess plans to teach told me a VX
works

529
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,049
Anne will host up to a to 100
application including the honey what if

530
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:01,580
I miss

531
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,799
would like for us and health management
over

532
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,230
oh stars creepy art for their team and

533
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,690
this buying management software I don't
know if you ever text by to real-time

534
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,149
operating system but what

535
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:17,440
once you are inside okay i win

536
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,279
and up there okay so the SMS asap post
exportation

537
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,929
if that's a diagram of official
documentation on five minutes when she's

538
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,669
demanding and I'm UNIX

539
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,519
in the it's connected only if feel their
systems

540
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,220
of the opening more approximately all of
them

541
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,450
okay so wise will have the flight
management system

542
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,929
you can try to target some of those
systems also

543
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,419
in some as away I for example

544
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,739
engine and fuel systems maybe or not
macon

545
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:52,830
of a computer you can think of the
flight controls is Esquire's

546
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,480
all their control Parliament white is
moving day the inner

547
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,299
wrong on more than a place you have for
the so-called 5a where

548
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,999
which is just sites teak always point to
three different computers that

549
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:09,600
do some calculations and after that the
computers of your

550
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,119
can be exploited or not this is not
within the scope of this talk about that

551
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,450
you can see the SMS

552
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,210
looks like the perfect place to a stop
of to conquer

553
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,470
all the systems of a funny thing okay

554
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,519
are so a prof post expectations arm

555
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,259
face kind of tricky I ask you can see a
picture of the

556
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:34,330
out the pilot thing its missing each
unsold

557
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,289
this is kind of our enemy because if we
want to somehow control

558
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,980
the airplane I'll have to try to
convince the pilots

559
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,749
don't you think it's the out a pilot
with news are that

560
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:48,889
aircraft and pilots are quite
predictable

561
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,889
because they follow techniques we follow
techniques and procedures

562
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:56,720
for all the normal operation and also
for the emergency operation

563
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,149
are on the emergency perceive your sex
I'm

564
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:03,149
of farm it means certification you have
to have

565
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,789
a hundred percent of success on the Apes
I mean you cannot niece

566
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:09,799
seem realistic so by having the

567
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,450
take the stand perceive yourself that
mean duped can somehow

568
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,549
know what's going to do that by not and
that their

569
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,559
something course panties okay I and we
have to avoid with the

570
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,129
you can see there on the left a the top
out the pilot

571
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,239
using it we have to try to avoid that
okay

572
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,549
after that we have to try to exploit
other communication and navigation

573
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:31,619
systems

574
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:34,950
are protocols sei se a cuss ATEC high of

575
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,070
something limitations I if we

576
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,110
go over be sad

577
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,169
a communications we can control then we
can overcome these limitations

578
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,669
and also we we'll be able to send some
messages that

579
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:50,950
would be discarded by a systems are

580
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,039
if not if we don't take care of that

581
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,529
paint say say planning and timing is
everything if we've no proper timing and

582
00:33:58,529 --> 00:33:59,619
proper

583
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:03,019
planning where we can convince the
pilots that its

584
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:06,440
happening something knowing how they are
reacting so

585
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,589
going to react so we can not just

586
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,619
avoid them to using its pilot at all so
we can even treated

587
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,470
make them to help ask into doing what we
want I know for

588
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,649
it online explore programming but for
pilots okay

589
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,700
I on to this address show time no your
gonna do these

590
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,049
I'll it's kind of by the pilot program

591
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:29,619
and after that are studies have come and
gone sour it's always

592
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:33,319
studies have two-way communication so we
can

593
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,510
sand for their actions to the expected
their pain

594
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,760
and try to overcome the limitations as
the a cussing

595
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,819
ATSB worms cocaine are

596
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:48,669
sign Simon its good name of at the ex
post pics but the Chinese and a half

597
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,619
develop white to the lib develops tax
Army Gen anyen

598
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,909
media was not just to I find

599
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,280
let me do some more the system's see if
they are secure not

600
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,809
and try to fix them working with the
manufacturers but also see

601
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,329
how dangerous would be to take over one
of those systems

602
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:10,190
here for that I had to develop Simon
with news is

603
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,579
Simon cannot be used on we are openings
because I developed that for the x86

604
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,210
platform

605
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,780
just for maybe for a moment soul we are
kind of safe

606
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,030
and se Morningside mode if its payload

607
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,430
first the state to upload a circle once
try to control our delivery Katie St a

608
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,430
casino that too

609
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,049
upload second essay stage effect States

610
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:35,990
after that we got a little bit of
persistence because once around

611
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,250
usually good an offer on the system's
some point and

612
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,119
more like to keep the Council of the
European even if the shut down a thing

613
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,069
as for a few hours

614
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:48,119
steadiness we don't need too well into a
rocket

615
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:51,910
because as you can imagine and see over
there on this carpet

616
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,290
and there is no way you can test
rightfully start the process is being

617
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,780
run on the FMS so

618
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,220
as long as we don't show anything a
strange someday

619
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,690
for a Electronic Registration those
games you can see here on the 380

620
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,210
cockpit

621
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,730
our pilots one careful so we don't need
to go into the real contest to

622
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,930
try to be a leader be citing so

623
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,900
what kind time on the winds uploaded
them establish some running on an FMS

624
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,750
and what an f'n

625
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,150
began after OLT change modify or remove

626
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,329
flight plans or databases if in this
house I

627
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,819
many databases for a radio eats a

628
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,970
aircraft perform and coast on in-line

629
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,549
the time we can try to modify some of
them or

630
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:36,869
test company lead for more for I

631
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,770
with anyone you can afloat a lot Spain
off the streets

632
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,180
went later that I plugins which are
tests

633
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,670
original quote that can improve the
abilities of

634
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,730
Simon ordered SN specific comments tool

635
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:57,880
to the up in Lake I'm not a K this case
of the two way communications okay

636
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,809
here so that demo time 14 ER

637
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:07,109
explication face are usually that were
said to ask that these

638
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:11,500
black a spring we so before all these
common problems with time on the model

639
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,049
airplane

640
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:15,549
but for many of the Psalms like

641
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:20,520
arm 2005 other highlights the importance
of these

642
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,710
I security issues and

643
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,650
also in order to improve the civility of
all that many months ago I decided to

644
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,960
too sweet to the platform so instead of
having

645
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,750
one basestation running all the meet on
airplanes

646
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,270
so far to find radio and everything and
on the laptop launching attacks

647
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,020
eight sided tool move to something more
comfortable

648
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,290
to wear take with you like for example
I'm away from

649
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,349
okay now I feel a little bit like

650
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,549
Steve Jobs showing on your device so

651
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:58,250
are I wanna show you our that the vision
of an application

652
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,500
I develop for Android that we can use
another to

653
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,040
hijack at makes alt

654
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:13,040
broke something

655
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,200
kennedy's you can see a normal

656
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm sorry device we've stop from

657
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,549
no hooking the special features even it
has not the years than that and rates

658
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:23,960
from

659
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,049
has this time from when I seventy okay
and this one is the one falling

660
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:31,589
the application okay so the first thing
we have to do

661
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,740
in other tool cock hijack

662
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,769
attack airplanes with them away they
should be 20 to Settings

663
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:41,940
02 more settings and of course on the
writing to it being mauled

664
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,940
looks like abuse anyway just giving you
got any that while soie

665
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,319
again sweetie to I think okay know every
day

666
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:00,510
I one thing no obligation its opening
our seats and notifications

667
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,839
I had from time to time of a potentially
whatever

668
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,260
a place that they are nearby are
basestation education is always

669
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,480
collecting information on the airplanes
nearby

670
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,490
are now that I get information and when
some of them reach

671
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,720
I know first for like 80 80 for a five
percent of fact explain to me the

672
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,819
are they send you a push notifications
and you can see here I P MOV in Ames

673
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:26,579
you can see just a guitar lines but you
can see there available or potential

674
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,150
admits just two people from you in the
upcoming also are we checked

675
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,009
just two to see at at any moment which
which ones have okay

676
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:37,430
after that we can test stop the
application which is Paul

677
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,569
planes but I know the name is not that
good I had the best time to think about

678
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:42,039
it

679
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,349
the interface the agony interface a it's
a

680
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,950
also divided in though the same faces
perhaps discovery information colony

681
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,759
exploiting of patients arm

682
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,819
for discovery for example would say use
to the task lorton team which

683
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:00,349
I guess we have four available at Whipps

684
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:03,849
but the and with the idea they will

685
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:06,990
I think I broke something into the mine
awareness dampening

686
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,599
okay I'm gonna move money

687
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,880
yep your

688
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,799
your yep

689
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:26,049
almost so here where

690
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:31,170
first thing we can do is to just stop an
external application of Earth Day

691
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,599
free to ask available placed or which is
called for another 24 March 20

692
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,099
must have you already know about that
shows up on the a airplanes

693
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,089
we can have read any information on our
own the events backed

694
00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:46,579
also if we half kinda far

695
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:50,789
local Target with local get information
about who can always switch to a mentor

696
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:51,589
for elective you

697
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:55,920
this is the I'm you can see here all the
available targets

698
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,359
using taser your camera and moving
around with some individuality

699
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,890
okay just to face the local wines after
that we can to select the target

700
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,480
I'll and in order to be able to

701
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,490
keep working with and Tesco to share and
share the available to the target with

702
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,359
our application

703
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,019
as you can see II your as you can see
here the target

704
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,240
has been selected in this case is what
just from the one

705
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,700
okay a heat-seeking so whenever I'm not

706
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,430
are we can also test hole to this huge
least of

707
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,880
and navy aircraft against being updated
from time to time

708
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,150
all weekend just anecdotal evidence
which is what we are gonna do today

709
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,359
okay after that we're going to
information that any

710
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:42,500
this house yes 14 force the vast
information with our fun

711
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,240
one additional vote on that went and
please communicate with the basestation

712
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,910
and Demi

713
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,019
if eats looks if this that it looks like
little are not based on the information

714
00:41:51,019 --> 00:41:52,339
we have been cutting

715
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:57,460
makers is hang of passing always nipping
way down here media and we say okay

716
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,539
exploitable fight and we can morph

717
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:04,329
into the exploit yes but it's just a big
but then when you press

718
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,180
and to deliver exploit and upload same

719
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,049
RVUs quite fast about anyway at this is
evident by demanding

720
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,160
free and what should be quite slowly

721
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,170
no as know it okay now you're supposed
to have fun

722
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,339
what we have to meet with my domain and
explore our

723
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:28,460
target fly I've been with the FMS
exploited and time on updated so we have

724
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,309
the coast expedition facing out

725
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:34,150
one of them do you remember the drunk by
Milt that we saw before

726
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,380
okay now we can see the same I know it's

727
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,289
being frame is with what's happening
here is I'm using this application up in

728
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:41,759
charge

729
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,799
i connect the dots today and for the PI

730
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,400
using the phone app so with the action
on matters we are controlling

731
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,150
day happen they are they the plane and
it will be a top-down

732
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,470
Friday again left and ap okay

733
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,869
also if you don't want to be flying
mammal European which and this time can

734
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:01,690
be annoying

735
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,890
and think what you mean you can't ask
say okay please go here

736
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,859
and you can see that the plane that he
faces it's always faster

737
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:13,940
okay also you remember that we could
upload the scripps

738
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,240
ok ABC say

739
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,980
escape editor we take all the a note 8
or payloads

740
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,790
for time on time divide it into
components fares to fall into three her

741
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,900
point and after that the action to their
point defines this if there were

742
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,220
and is these action wanna be a

743
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,560
execute it so we have to select some
coordinates

744
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,560
EC without Google Maps too late
someplace

745
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,780
we showed this place with I wanna pick a
show and you can see here that

746
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,109
that you've got an 80 its has been I i'm
established so we have a point

747
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:49,190
I tweeted yet been is going up do
whatever we tended

748
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,589
and want maybe not yet been that time
problem it's really hard to make an

749
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,420
airplane to fly

750
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,150
exactly over those caught in it so we
can be fine an area an area

751
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:01,369
ahead by the five years and also both om
and top

752
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:04,760
thunderous so whenever if this to Epping

753
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,700
price between within thank you know
meters you you think this house and

754
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,530
35,000 feet

755
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,579
at the action is gonna be execute

756
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,050
wheat actions okay I have some of them
like

757
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,089
make more friends which means look for
another claims

758
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:23,510
and fight will go over them okay
everywhere hijack

759
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,190
miss brown I don't have to explain that
one and piece of

760
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,579
I usually means hah we have been
discovered at least

761
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:34,069
a sexy story happen if any will be fine

762
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:37,530
offline if I plan so we can upload a new
flight plan and

763
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,810
we may get executed I and the sacrifices

764
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:43,890
to Toledo desk open to two-way
communication with a

765
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,440
screen something there that I love so if
someone you want to tie with pilots

766
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,480
apply the section and you can just start

767
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,950
stop talking with them doing stuff
introspection

768
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,010
that means title go into all their
system on what your pain

769
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,710
I am which 12-2 stay quiet yet looking
for ass

770
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,280
and deep and he's the last one in on the
fiends that sometimes all the mask

771
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,650
drove lights just have to mean people
screaming and Epping

772
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,950
that's your that's your who knows okay

773
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,680
we just with select something all like
sh

774
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,500
and ap bio action the selective we are
playing they have a dip a note and that

775
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,270
they look it's

776
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:26,369
successfully a bloody now Simon faz
another

777
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:30,849
trigger point and whenever it flying
they have been faced with in this area

778
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:34,550
the section we try to be executed okay
also I will show you some

779
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,050
act other things and developing at every
turn

780
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,359
the the phone Japan not see here

781
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,490
I you can see a map of the targets
koolhaas always

782
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,520
in you Anderson can see another and

783
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,839
least which is two books have two
different will work at times

784
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,119
that come in handy when you have to the
program

785
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,940
Simon for some point okay low stores
that are not looking

786
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,520
within being exploited I that's
something that does what are your friend

787
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,930
Rick out for example

788
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,930
are Boeing 737 take used

789
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,339
I told you it's really important to know
what's going on how to define us

790
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:16,280
if you will to get some action so just
to week taking what I'm gonna happen I'm

791
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,680
Lambert for your actions will and half
when you're

792
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,050
phone that suggest of the target that
mean and another one

793
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,480
is have professional application just by
pilots

794
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,680
in other to are 838

795
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,500
plan if I i fake blacks after I plan to
know that he said you can attest point

796
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,660
to appoint and that mean we go over
there to take into account review aids

797
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,220
attitude say planes have fields as basis
and other things

798
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,430
so it's always go to high five to like
this one to properly plan to fight

799
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,240
I fry pan I don't hide Jack are nothing

800
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,569
next week properly so no up proper
flight planning

801
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:58,480
okay and with the store you can always
just select the a review it and

802
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,500
if flight every and look for a better
fake okay

803
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,619
at the end of them okay

804
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:11,619
so of thanks

805
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,410
I know I don't mean a lot of time at
Tesla to Morris lights ok a concussion

806
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,580
one more slide rumination okay a usually

807
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,990
a on aviation I people tend to

808
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,240
speak lot about security but they mean
safety

809
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,420
so you have three times the same system
just in case one fan

810
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,010
are two failed you have just enough that
one so you can keep playing

811
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,880
but I'ma meaning I security yes we are
no security

812
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,470
their systems have nots rainy to face
these kind of attacks

813
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:43,610
okay so no to fix that I

814
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,350
first before the nx10 security and
should be improved

815
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,010
makes any sense next-generation Espace
being deployed and

816
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,210
even the sign right now have a lot of
things it includes

817
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:58,230
a DSP technology in acres so if the they
are still be playing then

818
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,940
may be wearing time to try to fix them
and leave them and they don't meet

819
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,160
of security just to nearly eight points
also mostly stems

820
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,470
should be if we view looking not for

821
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,820
sick safety and issues but for security
issues

822
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,600
back to normal whatever it is we are
always facing in our

823
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,780
everyday work okay push with to take
care of that

824
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,140
manufacturers because they are making
new systems have no service providers I

825
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,190
think it's important because they are
seeking

826
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,510
in the meaning of ice and yet Plains I

827
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,490
so they should take care of the security
of their systems installations

828
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,700
and also he likes I mean atlante they
don t the veil of the

829
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,730
systems but they are the primary
effective because the

830
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:44,120
or they are using the typings in
everyday

831
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,450
basis for babies me so they should take
care of actually we are booking

832
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,870
with my company and find with yes EPP

833
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,800
European aviation security agency to
improve the situation

834
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,840
we'll see if the s of security freemen
security or

835
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,770
safety witty we tell you okay so

836
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,990
some references for you I know ice I
half and play

837
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,310
I if long over some of the site things
week

838
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:13,390
but idea of what time I every talk too
much so you have to get on with issue

839
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,740
for you to read if you want to

840
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,880
well the pain to these I would like to
thank

841
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,420
are all these people that's asking me
some follow

842
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,060
are final or before the questions you
know that behind that would reset

843
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,610
that is always wow great for mentoring
may situation

844
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:33,400
things to Shelly force for everything
and

845
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:40,400
that's all

846
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:49,740
questions one in a real-world situation

847
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,830
would you have to be on the plane with
your Android phone to

848
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,320
to take over the controls can you do it
from the ground I'm sorry

849
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,440
it in a real-world situation which would
you

850
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,359
would you need to be in the plane as a
passenger to take over

851
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,720
the plane what can you do it from the
ground I have one problem

852
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,490
never hacked get things are fighting on
I mean

853
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,950
can be like oh she did was little endian

854
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,320
and you're pressing no no I a candle

855
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,780
depending if you are our you can always
be in the round of course if you are

856
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,790
you seem so what if and radio drug test
limited by the

857
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,260
scope for the range your antenna and if
you are trying to use any of those

858
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,340
ground service provider

859
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,520
which is a legal but the few manage to
do

860
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,760
then you have almost for Life coverage
but you can always do it from the ground

861
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,740
not already a to hack and have been I'd
not then try

862
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:47,740
any other questions

863
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,020
a.m. what's been the reaction of the
industry about these

864
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,170
ideas and these exploits Rd scared on a
saying

865
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:04,369
that's not gonna happen what's the with
the attitude 120

866
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:07,750
weeping contact with them for just a few

867
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:10,760
weeks launched yet since we announced
the stock

868
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,050
but at the moment I must say that I'm
sure price because they are facing the

869
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,050
subject I am they did in the night

870
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,550
from the beginning they yet mission to
actually come see that everything and

871
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:21,950
they

872
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,050
put ass in contact with a

873
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,220
that trying to help ice to take

874
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,930
on this research on it we are complete
higher were a pain

875
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,310
so I'm not denying everything then
hiding they're not saying

876
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,859
they are just trying to polite with us
to try to see if everything

877
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:44,130
we working or not they think that should
be so

878
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,349
now offering resources and wheeling to

879
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:51,609
to solve the problems so yeah I'm for
price grateful good

880
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,590
do you know any other any other groups
are working on this

881
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,270
plan this I E never I always thought

882
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:03,330
that I was not the first person to
resets like this one

883
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:06,490
maybe in the first one train to it that

884
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,160
that army can to work with the tougher
it is to fix their problems

885
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,070
I I I did affect about any other or
something that

886
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:17,619
but I'm pretty sure I'm not the first
cannot be

887
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:24,619
things great ok I think

888
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,320
is is

889
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,790
likely that it's possible that is going
to be updated on current plains or

890
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:39,190
is this something is going to linger for
many many years until things go out

891
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,340
surface because

892
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,390
they don't get firmware updates sorry no

893
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:46,780
I think mister to court I'm sorry ok
sorry

894
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,800
up is this something that isn't likely

895
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,980
and to be fixed on Kern planes because

896
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,360
they get from our updates were doesn't
that just happen because really

897
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,710
sorta long and cumbersome process nah
that's a question

898
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,980
many for the manufactures about for my
knowledge this is Tim

899
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:09,510
have two different groups well have with
half with the so-called legacy systems

900
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,210
the older ones from the 70s

901
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:14,640
now I things going to be very hard to
fix them I

902
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,850
in a proper way bad yeah an initial
improvement can be done

903
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,610
bad thinking about that it's all the
cold lot of things should be changed

904
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,980
and needs to illustrate or around the
world its expensive

905
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,620
hack tool to fix many costly so what has
been tested for years

906
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,080
everybody knows its fate it's a few
works perfectly a

907
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,640
any modification you like to them use
that safety

908
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,760
on more than systems idea

909
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,330
you can its EC because they have

910
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:46,740
mean develop better they have you know
you can be tough security mind so it

911
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,790
should be easier to

912
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,990
to be fixed back that's my opinion

913
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:54,170
you have to told with manufacturers to
the ones that reno

914
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,580
systems thank you very much I think

915
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,580
anyone else

916
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,780
yes as I'm not a commercial pilot

917
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,020
no positive any description I'm just
wondering

918
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,540
if you were flying the aircraft

919
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,620
what options do you have can you reboot

920
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,180
everything and switch off eight hours

921
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,240
so you don't get hacked again or are you
finished

922
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,980
yeah with question of course and the
question should be

923
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,890
is possible to sheet of acres its age 41
yet that would be a solution

924
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,360
for the acres make the remember the
mindmap okay

925
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,900
cass is just the one we are using today
if you remember that

926
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,080
was plenty of other branches budget know
that the face the acres

927
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,360
approach and to try to avoid that short

928
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,140
work if it's possible I am in anything
that you discovered that you are

929
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,400
from it has been actually from mice
depending on the airplane mode and more

930
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,730
than

931
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,750
I use reaching of the are

932
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,870
from a delta pilot the activities

933
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:07,880
that I the attack adequate to do

934
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,480
being decreased okay

935
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,920
I day the added your situation

936
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,100
would be to complete dunno of that the
pilot

937
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,250
the F is everything and just try to fly
the old ways

938
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,550
the other days just with if EU analog I

939
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:28,450
trying to go back one minute if you

940
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,580
if for example the 380 cockpit okay
please point me to one

941
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,750
all their analog seized and you can't
rely on like it a compass

942
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,110
an attitude indicator and it to say
something you can see maybe

943
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:44,490
here where I

944
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:48,040
come on you see that this is a keyboard
an attack

945
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,160
I thought back okay this is not the time
for calling missus

946
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,760
with hair his plane and given even see
their

947
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,840
are a control column its all that gear

948
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,870
its I speak inflated where another
computer

949
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:04,760
so a slit and Joe contrast idea of
course

950
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,860
right turning of almost everything
automatic plane like the old days

951
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,800
I you can test retest safe area airport

952
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,210
and the game naw racing that

953
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,870
in order for this to happen the pilot
for realize that something is going

954
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:21,490
wrong

955
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,210
and think okay what can be happening I'm
running out of fuel

956
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,530
no I think I have plenty of feed are

957
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,390
I'm having a stroke no oh yeah somebody
hacked my f'ing it's hard for pilot so

958
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,650
to look into it these I am for by

959
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:40,090
if they manage to do that don't they
know or whatever Jeff there are some

960
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:40,880
things they can

961
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,050
Voice that that injures at least I'm
some painted and even the airplane

962
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,630
more than down what about swine its less
advanced one

963
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:52,390
you have an old to play for national you
go hiking to that mean everything is

964
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,390
going on wincing the problem

965
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:59,000
back in time a little like this or any 7
too intense and then

966
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,990
380 all these new staff and also the
other one they are always updating

967
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,290
new systems which is your worst because
these they are

968
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,340
you have to make new systems work
together with

969
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,540
all system and some all the new system
so you can imagine this

970
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,260
and if I miss and security is not
something that they take into account

971
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,880
when they have time to wake up deceased

972
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,370
not that they did and so but religion

973
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:26,060
but many of them no the

974
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:33,060
on it how it goes

975
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,410
high-tech to work toward

976
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,020
worry here now I'm

977
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,369
if you were to target with my on and now
playing we do have

978
00:57:48,369 --> 00:57:52,070
to some forests

979
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:55,420
do some research to find out what kind
of fool

980
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,890
systems does it have world who

981
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:03,400
couldn't but get the full range of
planes or range of models were a

982
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,390
difference from

983
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:07,490
different it's different from company to
company online play online

984
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,300
the the flight systems that the him on
board if I am just a property that

985
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:12,970
question

986
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,080
that's the reason I half I'll

987
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,170
50 that the reason for the existence all
of the say

988
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,320
basestation collecting always
information on on the

989
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,010
available airplanes the more information
you have to but that because

990
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,070
for example a 737 depending on the more
than

991
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,660
on at nine a lot of things half

992
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,000
really different systems and you have to
try to reset thing that at least the

993
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,030
ones I wanna target

994
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:43,180
are the ones you think because I mean if
you'll do a mistake maybe you overnight

995
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,119
freeze to conserve

996
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:47,119
if to them when you want to do that so
dead

997
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,170
best information I think I can get up to
our

998
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,330
eighty-five to 90 percent of Symphonia
about

999
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,920
specific target by at I never tried

1000
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,750
course I have database of at

1001
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,940
I there was a collective of public
information on

1002
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,359
defend that been more than a satellite
everything so I

1003
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,990
always comparing permission to have
Hamilton dipping with information of the

1004
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:11,609
database

1005
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:14,890
and when I see Avery to set then
threshold

1006
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,760
a forty on right or in Nevada

1007
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,770
the vulnerabilities are different for
for different flight systems

1008
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:28,060
you of course one more question

1009
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:32,090
yes to are you told us you got some

1010
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:36,490
like cheap flight management systems
offer the baby to actually try to park

1011
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,430
your exploits to those real world
systems or

1012
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:42,470
you not do that yeah to be honest

1013
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,540
are when they faced israel says

1014
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,020
I was having my way idea that for maybe
that's because I wanted

1015
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,550
to no how secure system were I

1016
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:57,630
this call both the literally anything
not to take it will happen so

1017
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:01,130
and at the same circumstances I always
have to choose to get

1018
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,770
Colt which is that we have called about
PC platform

1019
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:08,050
so I couple exactly the same I resets
Mac

1020
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:12,980
my exploits Simon and everything will be
harmless into the real world so to keep

1021
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,780
them safe

1022
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,310
I I think so I know that when I believe
these

1023
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:21,109
on the same Colt are axes at the same
time on

1024
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:24,369
both platforms back exploit one work
which is good

1025
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:27,950
because I don't meet expect to work on
their wi-fi want to know that we have a

1026
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:28,530
tease

1027
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:33,130
benefits stratum so that's given at
something it's really is the same

1028
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:40,010
software yep okay we're

1029
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:46,300
we can we can do one last question two
more questions

1030
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,290
okay its Alaska today so we're gonna
going to spill over into at a time

1031
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:50,590
because

1032
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:54,730
dangers to pay I think he comes first in
only

1033
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:00,540
adamant okay

1034
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,630
how scared she will be actually here

1035
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,770
i'm looking for stalking here out from

1036
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,710
yes thank you hi I saw him with a
microphone I i was thinkin here to talk

1037
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,240
and

1038
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,359
was shocking current no question is how
scared she will be

1039
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:18,580
and is possible for

1040
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:23,160
countries to take over you a vis or
something like that is the same system

1041
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,100
okay again please sorry is it possible
for other countries to take over you a

1042
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,670
vis

1043
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,830
or something like that how you a piece
you a fee schedules

1044
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:35,360
drums you're out doing a Spanish at a
save my

1045
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,410
reset this out aviation so if it flies
should be with him i reset

1046
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,530
I'm cannot be fitted drones have backed

1047
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,860
you how fact all in Spanish

1048
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:50,660
that's a problem about it Freeman Rd
results of one of the attack vectors

1049
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,430
over you

1050
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:55,720
overtones I eat when year ago you happy
to my website

1051
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,450
be in germans why we do it PC weight
which is

1052
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,010
all the way back I okay

1053
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:07,150
here you can see if they come in the
kind that come there in at some point

1054
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,220
so what you have to link to the stock
it's in the Spanish about

1055
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:15,030
and as you can see this lights about
injuries have taken that the army

1056
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:19,630
idea of the receipts West note to mishap
with GPS because

1057
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:22,820
for anyone known not to try to attack
day

1058

a comment concerning that the normal
operator uses because this is pointless

1059
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:30,480
about to take the fear out and other
defectors have some information there

1060
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,750
but they cannot talk about ongoing
recession the issue

1061
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,140
Issa a focus innovation if it flies

1062
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:42,710
has something to do with aviation should
be on them I'm yet

1063
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:46,380
thank you okay so I'm

1064
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,540
the trend in the security industry he's
the patch

1065
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:54,970
exploit to patch time is shrinking meet
used to be

1066
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:59,420
%um quite a long period is now getting
dancers a couple weeks

1067
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:04,420
hours if necessary the quite correct
safety first culture in the

1068
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:09,170
aviation industry courses to take as
long as you absolutely needs to convince

1069
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,170
yourself whatever you doing is such said
the Dreamliner

1070
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:15,510
instant going on a moment has been
running for a very long time

1071
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:20,460
is costing absolute fortune and in your
dealings with his

1072
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,020
on the authorities as a stepping up to
the plate

1073
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:28,780
in terms have realizing that you know
their other background everything which

1074
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,900
not really could be prepared to do
imagine or they're gonna have to really

1075
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,910
get to grips his your changing their
internal processes and procedures to go

1076
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,410
to do things in Internet

1077
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:42,240
time which they really not be used to
doing so

1078
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,420
if and that I miss the property in show
the question is

1079
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,090
how are those authorities manufacturers
and people are going to face the

1080
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,330
solution of this problem

1081
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,360
I out to be honest I think means a lot

1082
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,760
too early to say that because which has
been in contact for a few weeks

1083
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,760
moms yet nothing its ongoing get by also
I

1084
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,610
I say they I feel comfortable with your
initial reaction

1085
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:10,060
I don't know what's going to happen
maybe you have to West they

1086
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:13,430
it's a huge problem is not ec2 fee to go
you can fix

1087
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:17,610
as you say 11 a.m. ET two women only
these but the problem here is that this

1088
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,740
technology rates and miss that when I
have to take is not secured also

1089
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,170
is not easy for them I don't know how
they plan to that

1090
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:31,400
I would give you for if I can I don't
know alright

1091
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,470
thank you I believe that wraps up the
Q&A session and also it means it wraps

1092
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:35,790
up

1093
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:38,270
