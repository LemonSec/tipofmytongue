on those it Walker which kind of I P A

39

courage to the cannon to execute to

43
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,160
on code and develop a does a in use on

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,830
so I the be the

45
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,300

weaver am a custom brush enough 35

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,190
from some kind of every mother a

um in fact is in a brief action

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,930
where you if I film where first cedar or
die and be a bioassay interruption

88
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,180
to on there's a some kind of other

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,770
Mazar there are many many more

90
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,110
for you are you a five-year about where
I kept up sir

91
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,410
to a

92
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,100
for some months and

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,570
just to explain news the

94
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,110
were from where his return incident
which its utmost to

95
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,180
malls on the

96
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,139
1 million of cosines um

97
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,969
everything has been your return from
from skirts

98
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:20,569
from scratch the should 42 across core
CPU Dyker

99
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,139
our Airmen the the X 34

100
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,379
a a Windows Linux and I have heard of
course

101
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,919
a a poor just the

102
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,699
introduce some specific feature and
knows it's a

103
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,869
you if I implementation a to supporters
our

104
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:44,800
custom out were so

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,169
good body the we have heard that from
fag for

106
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,830
phase before unloading the faster with
manager

107
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,949
the first phase is a sec the

108
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,839
its many a.m. the film where we'd show
parade to

109
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,330
integrity check are on itself just to
check everything is okay

110
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,300
a

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,389
and is a reprint important facet is a

112
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,069
pre pain decision fires a

113
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,460
Weezer initialization up to

114
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,470
proceso a for example for

115
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,690
project the switch in protected mode
upon a mother

116
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,080
for 64 processor

117
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,520
as a chipset Anza was ample the which is
and she's a

118
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,939
yeah in his face next to the

119
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:35,979
it's a

120
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,849
the most important power enough
somewhere a.m.

121
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,020
in fact in this phase

122
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,620
order um a

123
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,580
you if I am what jurors are loaded in
memory

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,290
in fact it's arm driver

125
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,540
to support her out where so on the trot
Kyle

126
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,690
%uh graphic card and so on and the

127
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,440
product from specific protocol for to

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,240
network but occurred next you if I

129
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,430
the try to lloyd's um

130
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,889
with manager a

131
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,860
which is thought by the Texas fixed
location

132
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,870
to a an exhibit reader

133
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,120
as two roads a approaching system in
memory

134
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,290
so that's a tsar phase an exit visa

135
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,390
class again classic order approaching
systemic secretion

136
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,190
runtime: and the what's

137
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,620
funny nurse persecution secure you can
find the

138
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,800
from a question mark falls over

139
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
best fazer after if in fact simmons's
test phase

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,240
its the in

141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,820
you if you can wear is a cute too some
some code the

142
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,529
before as approaching system

143
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,270
is a

144
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,040
exhibited again a

145
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,240
could be interesting 02 work some
function

146
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,180
which under

147
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,010
and Xavier mission know you if I to
inject some code

148
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,399
why not if we compare our do if I

149
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,500
and by us the

150
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,949
when we had by us you know I've out
there

151
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,290
a

152
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,399
it was first executed in protection
mother nectar

153
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,030
BIOS switch again in a

154
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,939
in Korean mother

155
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,779
and the phone ratings a

156
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,079
must all be which we call the and the
executed so BIOS

157
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,420
difficulty to under a

158
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,650
on high-capacity out rave a a

159
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,040
it's a very old score to to develop on
Bo's

160
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,290
the you when they have access to one
week about

161
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,030
when we get better for memory

162
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,010
and the it's very blue bring 20 per

163
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,460
and we do if I it's quite a quite easy
to

164
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,330
to developer some to YouTube sings a
Greg which other

165
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,310
for example of wickets um

166
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,110
in fact we value if I a

167
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,580
so messed up wit record is a completely
removed

168
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,720
a.m. it is replaced my

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,870
fact fake partition a and you cut

170
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,130
but to by aryan on it

171
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,959
art by there is a arm

172
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,889
users have PO your format from

173
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,009
Microsoft a and

174
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,620
what is interesting is a binary are
directly executed

175
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,550
in protecting know the wrong mother

176
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,690
and the you can just developer

177
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,440
the wrong things you know directly no
students in which

178
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,530
weaver I love era API so

179
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,080
yes just through to remember obey obey
also when BIOS was

180
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,740
their from answer read more the
addressing

181
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,090
so you you were there when they give a
tough memory to a

182
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:25,149
it was a very bring to a developer on
the issue on the over

183
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,139
shoe memory fixed on jurors to

184
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,220
writer

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,810
on

186
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,899
under video from befor

187
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:40,119
throws a worrier weightier boring and
creates a bitter it's a better score to

188
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:45,089
to the repair except sewing BIOS

189
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:50,149
you we are doing direction before so if
you remember our classic or interruption

190
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:50,899
for

191
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,100
radio no tanna so tune in for a drive

192
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,550
and so on %ah

193
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,690
and there was no memory management she
wanted to be a stronger

194
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,850
you have a ok allocated some memory ne2d

195
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,680
world that fixed address for friends on
for and many many

196
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,060
menacing at Exit on you a failure is
quite easier everything is on

197
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,490
on the bases the somewhere a

198
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,250
faxes so hurrrr operating system

199
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,320
and a you with an Ivor disabilities tax

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,500
the visit their over many many menacing

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,580
and of course so secure boot which has
been no

202
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,990
introduce to to arm

203
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,110
developer Tristian between za

204
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,820
few minds a.m. cutting systemic section
we such statements one

205
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,410
for

206
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,620
the you if your development your name
before use

207
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,890
we had to the

208
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,020
is a fast as the K Bernina if I'm

209
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,030
so sorry to it was a

210
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,210
some some year ago the

211
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,810
what's this interesting as its

212
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,030
is you can find a a writer for

213
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,700
insecure function like to press for a
string copiers printers

214
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,460
for and so on and the

215
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,070
today's else to use the user chrome to
from where

216
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,910
so if you too just grabs a

217
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,350
the source code you can find the

218
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,339
menu if profound Cesar two were to the
function

219
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,149
and many many a.m. mergers or over to
Ian's it was a function

220
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,810
like driver out when there's a stipulate
stacked a

221
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,900
so it's a bitter with crazy a.m.

222
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,940
I V I am do not ever

223
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,310
made Bernard Genesis directions a
somewhere I just have met the focus on

224
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,710
the

225
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,070
the big tits but I'm pretty sure there
are many a potential lover nobility

226
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,470
issue you ever look at just some

227
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,880
measures that are loaded Vegeta that
stuff

228
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,930
%uh is just a sunburn

229
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,690
you can find many many product for I
returned from a from scratch

230
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,940
a for doing good FCP

231
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,779
year AP se ca USB

232
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:31,779
many many many Singh I would talk to you
about

233
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,370
a about development to you a failure
development

234
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,690
a scratches it with Europe for using
good repressive to reserve a curve is

235
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,370
just your

236
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,010
a just introduce a new constantin in the

237
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,589
them the APA format for

238
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,230
you are you a five-year subsystem is so
if I on the Scottish Inn

239
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,470
a those are same for driver

240
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,760
are for a custom firmware for example so

241
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,170
today's are you a five-year firm

242
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,510
who is the guy is quieter quite clear

243
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,110
you ever a separation between packager

244
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,470
for the ringer cryptographic stuff net
fork

245
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,550
security and so on you ever have a.m.

246
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,450
a custom a.m. show when I mean it off

247
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,899
well you can the

248
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,149
check if your custom firmware is working
where no

249
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,680
your application you have a an
integrated share

250
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,060
you a fight shown um is a framework is a

251
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,990

256
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,480
you a failure has been a design by Intel

257
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,350
and the

258
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,220
you and the only thing you know the the

users if food is the carrier on the
sauce four chan.org on

260
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,660
and as a sitter IFE high school kid it
was a

261
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,420
arm right I think it would be better to
be a

262
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,660
indexes song Microsoft Data it's a bit
difficult to understand the

263
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,759
would you worked in a as a consortium

264

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,780
everything is a provision for station
there's just an example

really interesting

301
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,210

306
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,010
Windows betrayed their arm on disks so

307
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,510
in this case we use a fights is

than

309
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,500

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,050
we try to to check whether windows

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,910
just a let you were up for Twitter what
are your source

327
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,000
your library dependencies the

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,870
on which package issue you defend arm

329
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:34,600
so it's quite so easy to use here's an

330
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,940
you if you share a example a you if you
show is just too

331
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,000
a specific your you if I a petition
which is

332
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,490
which is a shipped with most most him
where love

333
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,570
with the show you can do amendment
saying they come with singer

334
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,270
inching drive pressings a.m. %uh

335
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,750
checking we're which much jus RROD the

336
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,510
a over who gets a memory my a.s.a.p 8
ever

337
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,050
you can do miss singer for debugging
purposes

338
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:12,750
but to

339
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,210
we've answered were what about so
security the

340
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,390
in fact is there is a

341
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,380
look menacing for example if you were

342
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,490
look at the memory is absolutely no

343
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,400
protection they're effing is thrust
either I'll page Ave try to execute

344
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,010
so it's great to quite easy to

345
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,860
to manipulate a a so as I said before

346
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,860
I'm is a implemented a custom

347
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,929
option I was a

348
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:46,549
said there is a very so it could be a
security risk

349
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:50,369
and a is free

350
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,470
eggs eggs and third of the sedately
stack

351
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,109
a a which when I answer as his customers

352
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,420
city very a

353
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,970
I think the they made some mistake

354
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,700
not sure but I think those are pictures
when I visited

355
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,060
have not checked the path but British a

356
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,260
only go we can we can say a secure boot

357
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,190
has been a a introduced to

358
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,760
was a to to be to trust chain with the
fam where which to check user but reader

359
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,660
is just a sign %uh there's a better
though

360
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,180
try to to verify froze up in are you
throw the

361
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,720
a again just tell you sign a a.m.

362
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,980
but that's the same for secure boots /a

363
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,270
its more my stuff its companion to

364
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,340
70 from scratch for example

365
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,809
for bill but seeing ongoing set ck2

366
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:52,770
every cryptographic primitive a have
been rewritten from scratch

367
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,830
and I think there is managing to to

368
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,710
to do in maybe in the future I would
welcome

369
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,059
%uh on this what about to

370
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,630
the beginning now to

371
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,019
I've tried to to do d-bags a.m.

372
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:12,920
a

373
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,830
I'm you if I some you if I been
re-written using capture books

374
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,450
a which support material

375
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,960
if I but a

376
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,100
mind main issue is

377
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,899
the Chatterbox been is not able to boot
the

378
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,929
Windows a Windows 8 a

379
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:34,380
maybe the best chance for us months but

380
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,450
when I have bids a with kit a.m.

381
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,200
it was a as I was in the open ticket on
doctor books it's

382
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,440
I think for to of reels

383
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,970
I work about program review if I in the

384
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,180
windows 7 you if I and as a hitter and
the

385
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,960
nothing happened so it does not work
weaver

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,670
VMware

387
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,880
it was everywhere just two just a diner
and two are due into

388
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,750
may know if Eric's fighter somewhere
like water if I

389
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,660
quite cheesy and you can the

390
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,429
activator should be disturbed to

391
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:20,429
to do a remote too big so

392
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,500
be free Cup come back to was a

393
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,970
you if I the process a the

394
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,559
zone menacing testing to to a deeper get
a

395
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,730
UK so for what kate is interesting to

396
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,390
to try to debug the Windows betrayer

397
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,610
in fact they are burn too but for wit
radio

398
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,650
first one is bouta and you have the
value and Erwin Road

399
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,940
and so it's

400
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,000
interesting to chew dip exam I A and the

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,080
to trade a to for example bit kit is

402
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,980
working OK so if

403
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,090
Sri take the the first

404
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,620
feels betrayed their with the museum
really term

405
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,679
its search is it true to break a in it
using your

406
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,779
so used to disturb them

407
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,859
to binaries our room a redo I'm is
always a ojeda

408
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,909
at the same address so it's quite easy
to put a breakpoint

409
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:29,960
a you can I so I do

410
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,849
we've some friggin to some script we've

411
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:37,249
too short to be true were a to have some
more

412
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,909
is possible for I am

413
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,059
but babe is a the best way true to do it

414
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,070
is to activate

415
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,080
some is a win Weiner

416
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,710
the busy a first-ever a is as a reader

417
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,700
the

418
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,500
infect you you can activate the big mo
the you know

419
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,920
both a between them so for the first one

420
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,100
we just have to activate a would the big

421
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,370
a we've crossed scarfing for

422
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,179
Syria or the beginning a

423
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:14,400
forces a fest H week for their a.m.

424
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,630
a is unit 2 to to Petes

425
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,820
her a on as a permit or through to
activate to

426
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,010
to fester fester however we

427
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,210
within do not find a

428
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,480
a hunter users a.m. to fester

429
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,640
in fact if you use a win too busy

430
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,770
under first so first withdrew their a

431
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,400
there are some by the value for a.m.

432
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,880
siegman segments for gestão in fact to
see SNSs

433
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,110
at the bad values so we can't see your
step into code

434
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,250
a

435
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,280
we've put money in many areas chunks and
things in so

436
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,340
it does not work for really good the

437
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,650
only therefore we know that's not true
everything is everything is okay

438
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,010
and you just have to use a

439
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,950
a six-year command when there is a
common to

440
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:19,950
to braker when we know the stuffed

441
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,240
so now weather but dreamboat

442
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,760
a

443
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,049
it's a Windows 8 to

444
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,929
a which it the talks in the for

445
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:38,530
64 proceso a

446
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,350
time infected so

447
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,740
just a.m. appeared to be a binary a

448
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,860
which could be store on a eyes oh

449
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,950
for example we just need to

450
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,010
just need a her fate to such affection

451
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,250
a.m. sorry is a is a

452
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,309
sink in addition to I'm either is just
one way to do

453
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,600
to do the job was there is plenty a
frenzy of ways to

454
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,289
to to courage to windows can then into

455
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,260
which one some manage the way for

456
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,620
during boot is to the

457
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,860
to execute summers some co doing news on
an

458
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,270
a first aid is to

459
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,590
bypass look at it on station a.m.

460
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,140
a bit like the in tourer call doing

461
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,930
conduit if you meet a

462
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,040
so you just a with from za

463
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,970
as israelis 0 and the just press until
10

464
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,970
looking pointer appear and your own with
some tickets and next time is the second

465
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:53,180
Pedro the weaver just got a privilege
escalation

466
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,330
so it does not exploited and even every
T

467
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,750
as a with criticism herded graded the
false account

468
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,250
the but Sir treasures for

469
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:10,860
often so hard to do that

470
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,910
a we'd many will catch

471
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,580
the the for Windows a

472
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,660
with process so fast food worker

473
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,180
the the true felt betrayed their were
times you have the value and we know

474
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,830
that the

475
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,340
and next the

476
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,870
as a counter a but so is just some
tricks to

477
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,510
this activator some kind of protection a

478
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,630
to make it work for

479
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,299
for Pedro the a development we use the

480
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:47,450
PS said grow do but she its favorite in

481
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,760
we just insert could work in the system

482
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,070
the

483
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:56,020
which is called when the new process
asked for no

484
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,600
new gydar rated so

485
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,290
just tour to remember was a the

486
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,360
government does a process the with
process

487
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,200
the so we have this is a first

488
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,090
with manager was take 60 in fact showed
the

489
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,620
pcs store and next the from sales
execution through

490
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,600
two were a search on Google Reader which
is when you know the which should do the

491
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,230
same

492
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,600
this time between the Zicam there and
next the

493
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,140
guys systems after is a government
function

494
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,700
is colder Jackie from a from wheel
loader

495
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,200
annexes classic or can ensure efficient
process

496
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,150
and the after we have so session
management subsystem which is void

497
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,780
to lookin prone to clear use 20 now

498
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,920
are I or mentor is a

499
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,730
is a is ready so

500
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,730
we just have to to rookie riffing to

501
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,280
a and some time are all located Wilco
the

502
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,190
a we see way so

503
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,330
first the first agent a

504
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,070
is to to the the

505
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:26,580
as if we doing things if the value
grader a a

506
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,410
in fact we read it work a specific
function

507
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,410
which is in charge of firm transferring
za execution through

508
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,460
from a

509
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,890
as a filter there too Siegelman

510
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,200
is a press best place to to put okay she
incur

511
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
because we have Jack tarea 0.0 to reno
the

512
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,240
to its core the so trip is going off
work

513
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,520
to a pertussis percy come that work
under Windows its

514
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,790
since itself in practice

515
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,700
the it's great to easy this is faster

516
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,940
first aged we can the director

517
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,480
would cute and seduce in wage a was
there is no program weaver

518
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,490
a memory over independent code

519
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,400
so we can use a directly year

520
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,490
can wear Avik the

521
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:25,580
first thing to do is to located between
though

522
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,750
and disc for risk which is it is that's

523
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,260
what we we have seen before we have a
fighter are you

524
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,870
protocol a next we need to to ruin to

525
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,500
pose a veterinary memory it's quite
cheesy with you if I just go to

526
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,370
chords a.m. the Zanetti function which
manages

527
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,420
and you have the is Irvine area which is
a

528
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:55,200
and met make it in your memory next to
me just users a

529
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,650
loaded image could occur to retrieve
information

530
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,870
the about the Celeste the

531
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,720
rated merger a for example its image
baeza

532
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,310
size and so on buzzer image bases enough

533
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,500
because we just want to for two chrome

534
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,650
uncoated so next three

535
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,540
medic classic order the but to pat down
Shareef

536
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,580
but then search in memory and we can a

537
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,390
but work on that specific function and
next week and transfers execution

538
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,200
approach was a

539
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,410
windows which were there a just by using
a step two major

540
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,220
fiction so that's very very easy to

541
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,540
to tuning to make those a faster faster
than

542
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,780
so

543
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,190
year was a possess on his face of the
the

544
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,520
as a function really reworked and faxes
the

545
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,590
very difficult to pronounce its the

546
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,450
but this function France every execution
through to to

547
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,250
we'll order a when the core the eric's

548
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,630
is a

549
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,429
executed just before you

550
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,300
you you have a newer I did see a shitty
which is inserted

551
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,340
should a and the

552
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,830
this year free a register which is used
to lose here for

553
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,550
for memory management so we just

554
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,659
patch z-score 2 a.m.

555
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:35,190
going to acquire the and from Cody we
redirect record

556
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,460
so we know the on 3-point so next

557
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,990
we have no work in the we know the

558
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:47,020
for their the second for their we the

559
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,350
for just it now to but as

560
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:55,149
sickened ok a when we know that we
france has execution through

561
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:00,600
two were no end to US Canada and there
we read a

562
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,740
try to exact address some protection
acre

563
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,860
the page go out hours to a an exe

564
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,390
beat and we will go Lucas owners are

565
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,590
cannot function who is see that

566
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,900
later so hard to do it

567
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,050
so it's exactly is a is the same
procedure weaver's affairs between your

568
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,330
we we had a

569
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:31,330
a a patch the a a so he said action
transfer choke 'em that function

570
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,030
her just before as a can I don't report
it is

571
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,870
is called so it's exactly the same the

572
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,100
the court is made the their Weezer it if
you were

573
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,870
restriction so we just have to repress

574
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,950
weekly places is a restriction weaver

575
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,610
on and everything is okay and neck from

576
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,900
aqui records a.m. the

577
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,580
can then counterpoint sewing

578
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,600
now it means a.m. is this book the

579
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,740
we have two executive is some protection
a

580
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,530
because a at first will harm are of
course other

581
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,950
wherein za the you sure you're

582
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,220
usually failure met in memory but now we
wait or

583
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,320
okay to call with the incise accounted
safe a in fact the

584
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,670
done it in the it's for work Ishant ever

585
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,930
so owns a come it is rooted in memory

586
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,690
a goes for could go to cushion ever not
choose any more

587
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,310
so we can pat Quinn's air but the

588
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,840
the in the page persisted

589
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,250
assists in a two pager a on that too

590
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,780
exit executive dir so and

591
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,590
is due to an exhibit so we need to to
these activated to

592
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,600
his account had is a Festa
initialization phase

593
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,390
is a NX bitter

594
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,910
disc which is it exactly eight ish sure
through

595
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,520
for control others are Canada so we can
the

596
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,550
we can find the Associated code very
city

597
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,470
weaver I did for example just have to do
some cross-reference

598
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,540
the runs a stranger in execute

599
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,560
a which is a and

600
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,860
perimeter for decidi to tour

601
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,900
issue 12 is activator index

602
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,520
so we just have to two-page

603
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,370
a just adjourned to her to jump about
discord in

604
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,510
never executors eat in the

605
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,980
xanex between the beer activated but
chief

606
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,120
we only do that we have a speaker
risking have this

607
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,250
in French this case a

608
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,420
we've critic or stricture corruption a
exception

609
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,220
in this case it's a page world

610
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,780
to food detector the

611
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,090
but seeing a a pin infected

612
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,240
they are Sabean detects a

613
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,030
those occurred which has been injected
you know what occasion to her

614
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,310
I don't know home maybe we've some
integrity checker

615
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,710
offering a goth so

616
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,630
now I a I'm a hookah I've

617
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,860
look to them for quite well then the
weight which is activated

618
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,410
it's a

619
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,430
disc which is it too two friends a

620
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,930
as the was a function which and said
there is a

621
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,290
has grown infect you sure whoever is a

622
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,390
fish order devoting more the

623
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,359
edge grout could be found unveils a

624
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,760
k year I need to and 0.64% specific
state

625
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,040
it's quite up skated a boat

626
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,410
notorious in fact a.m.

627
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,970
but a grounder is activated

628
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,640
only on the a a Canada which arm

629
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,880
a on 02 depicted so in fact

630
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,590
a

631
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,640
me Chris ofthe and you came into

632
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,670
the specific trick a which we rely on
the

633
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,130
for teaching division in fact that is a
Canada

634
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,990
is no to depicted the is a division the

635
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,080
feder an exception is launch and next
coach

636
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,670
get shit and the in to them

637
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,290
its own server edge grow other decision
process

638
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,740
so we just have to patch and to pitch in
this function

639
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,750
a is Brianna a to research on that

640
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,800
to a a a no its not too

641
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,550
did begin so because exception arena and
developers for

642
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,860
throne and the a pitch well we cannot be
activated

643
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,940
and it's not detected a after I ain't

644
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,380
it whatever so i'd it was very easy to

645
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,650
to directory page ground in this case
because it's not too

646
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:24,930
the chronically executive so it's quite
easy

647
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,700
so it's just a should look at two

648
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,510
during boot code just across a cool but
sure

649
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:36,080
and new keeper Chur oh and

650
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,330
and concern that germs infection very
critical

651
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,760
so next

652
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,560
we it so now we have is activated some
can that protection

653
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,440
and the 10-page grover and we just need
to find a way

654
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,730
to execute could a

655
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,350
wider you zone on the of a Vermont is
deployed

656
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,470
so I just found

657
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:07,530
founder litter trick the manages to

658
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,010
the per to on the NT setting for
missions for the

659
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:16,130
8k an

660
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,510
and say I really am. occur specific

661
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:25,240
a specific Pedro the to which we
recorded a servicer

662
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:32,240
grow the and mission its failure which
in so

663
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,840
just the for their meetings a Canada be
executed

664
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,040
I past summer export the

665
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,230
to to use em in the

666
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,300
first to appear on stage in Duke of her
and she said

667
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,170
informations freight the in fact so I
just reserve a summer some function

668
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,880
a

669
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,510
on and and manages to

670
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,950
to break on this function because could
on the beer

671
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,080
corner on Newton said is a the Canada

672
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,310
a January

673
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,620
in this function is called when the
first years are in process

674
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,110
house phone %uh

675
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,480
to go to Sudan subsist in management
process

676
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,630
SMSs the it's maybe is a fast process
which corners is so

677
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,800
API so

678
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,620
now owns a kinetics has been insensitive

679
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,960
a fests design process

680
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,250
our own church so we break into

681
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,700
walk in the area and she sets
information thread

682
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,710
a but we have a

683
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,290
we should have an issue the because a
work or there's been a great but OK to

684
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:56,640
them

685
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,170
in the is a key on their the what a
kitchen table or

686
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,300
the but owns a

687
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,370
use or not of germans deployed the

688
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,380
his account then a but some some page

689
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,110
the take it as a this caliber

690
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:17,290
so everything is no to excessive or any
more from memory

691
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,630
so we need to move again zev which kit

692
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,380
her memory in this case is a I love

693
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,240
have a key to do is to make a Marie
using gotta

694
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,640
Canada area the

695
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,090
extricate poor guess could run we've
known page it put execuse faggot which

696
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,500
has been introduced weaver

697
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,620
Windows 8 next take a bizarre

698
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,230
but could go to a into his memory a

699
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,340
a education and next

700
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,010
in the in Cisco that a

701
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,580
I can now coda is a years said Tim

702
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,050
loaded you mention it if its favorite in
to

703
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,710
02 final period and the

704
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,330
a a so the first one which should make
us look at it on skittish in

705
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:10,830
Anza Singh online which two were
previous kisch

706
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:15,280
so in

707
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,420
now in there let's go weaver we've paid
roads

708
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,500
a just a editor trick

709
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,210
to happy patch in memory the

710
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,340
I forgot that before a we have to users
a sears is 0

711
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,350
register two words activator

712
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,040
WP you the bit

713
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,230
is a right protector a a a a flag

714
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:47,610
so in fact in fact we have two to Eros a

715
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,650
erases bit in cr0 before doing patch

716
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,740
from come there to use around the from
come there to

717
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:00,740
to come in so far for state or the

718
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,790
is a look at our Constitution bypass so

719
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,040
nuffin retinue a the just the

720
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,680
a page in the a.m if you keep this will
validate inside I'm view on the score 0

721
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,070
year a so I just the

722
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,430
the have bitch sorry town %uh for

723
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,120
that's your computer memory y tu
comparing the

724
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:30,020
and shit and digest they just so

725
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,880
everything is this fine weaver but if I
could back

726
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,310
a because a you know correct diameter

727
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,690
we have a everything to to do a patch

728
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,620
a a user image busy match size

729
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,260
a as a PhD so its

730
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,380
very easy to to patch next for private
education

731
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,640
a its are so that's ok white CZ

732
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,970
I just use across recorder the

733
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:08,780
the Q&A technique the which manipulate
very clearly process stricture

734
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,820
the mine and is to Bros

735
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,030
a secularist a a.m.

736
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:18,740
corder act effective process links

737
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,490
a it's a securities

738
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:27,570
weaver are the process stricture a a so
we just have to

739
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,020
found find a a just 21 the process
structure

740
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,850
and we kinda broza I love them song

741
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,790
manages to substitutes the said took
infielder

742
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,170
and repress eater weaver replace it with
a

743
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,020
a previous shitty a token so

744
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,600
manages to Kapisa has to come from a
system process

745
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,670
which has always a 27 kg

746
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,690
for and the

747
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,520
we can do

748
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,820
as escalation Fish Commission

749
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,850
so just a.m.

750
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:10,200
one way to retrieve a the process to do
is to

751
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,530
look at the two years get current
process this angry

752
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:17,390
the to end of code a

753
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,320
we just retrieves a a the process for
cheer from a

754
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,690
kept this year and the

755
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,730
term at someones that you have to the
process richer

756
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,770
of course it depends if as a

757
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,180
current operating system but it's a

758
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:41,200
no had to fix fixed address so next the

759
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,370
is a curve to manages to

760
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:47,490
broza secretaries to time one-time to

761
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,700
look for system process get stuck in

762
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,610
second time to your father's sins a

763
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:58,700
process and the replay replaces so can
we as a system

764
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,800
assist system one we yes

765
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,740
just pertz a for low bid to

766
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,690
of is it took into 20 in fact just two

767
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:14,210
Canada printer to check how many times a
token is a

768
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,880
reference in I fancy the concerns a

769
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,160
succumbing so and now I'm just a

770
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,810
returns tomorrow so if fear I have 'em

771
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:37,810
Windows Azure 10 mission

772
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:47,210
my computer is a bit slow so sorry

773
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,310
so I just have a Cusco to account

774
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:05,570
protected by you the bus herb so they're

775
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:11,590
adjust appreciation and next day we
reboot

776
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,610
and the during boot to as a

777
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:21,530
so in my

778
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:26,300
the term mission sitting I have

779
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:33,300
the during weekdays 0 which is there a K

780
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:47,750
so its assertion be a fan

781
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:14,880
to just three words if mister machine

782
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:40,870
I think every text video tweet for be
faster

783
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,770
so here you go the I'm

784
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,079
reservations quitter Cueto a

785
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,540
is a you if I share a

786
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,580
in this case I'm witching from the I so

787
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:32,410
so and now I've

788
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,870
just the pitch it the fests

789
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:42,870
which are there

790
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:58,060
Jerry chick trying to minimize soldier

791
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,220
just met midsummer better graphics /a

792
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,270
it old school a because we did

793
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,470
if you if I you can use a graphic but
occur and use a

794
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,700
however happier here we're Marshall

795
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,670
graphic out the and I've big resolution
a a

796
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:20,220
such a jerk or also many missing may be
over

797
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,920
avenge heroes who in we don't know so an
exe

798
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:31,920
windows process with process continue
teaser

799
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:39,250
login prompt

800
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,310
naive we can just come tell compass for
two and hugs a

801
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:58,310
station

802
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,619
and next when the we'll announce the

803
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:05,069
chintzy consumer a a

804
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:12,069
as a token has been changed to to system

805
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,110
to address to where my command

806
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:28,390
and we are now system

807
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:31,360
yes sorry for for the demo man

808
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,860
faster machines for it it says are a
bitch friend

809
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:41,010
so to conquer the a

810
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:44,870
the source code is a available or on the

811
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,839
get a

812
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:49,970
a since yesterday a

813
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:53,150
there is a 404 source code and the

814
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,369
a so the experiment owner a a reso

815
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:00,760
so if you want to try it it's a as
Feinberg's a

816
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,970
a a to me and to me the

817
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,839
next I plan to the continues a

818
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,660
dream would too development maybe truer
support

819
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,770
a

820
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,930
market picture maybe the 86

821
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:20,240
and soap review session for Windows

822
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,040
a

823
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,950
maybe just from Windows a 7

824
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:31,210
a I think to about two miles away true

825
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,670
to do the job a for example and

826
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,970
fests a first phase the

827
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,520
I directly work a means a Windows betray
their

828
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,640
but what no directly to Kings a from
where it's a it's possible

829
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,160
to 'em and the

830
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,210
inject magic code directing the film
where

831
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,380
a as advocated betrayed the

832
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,670
a on but which were there have to rely

833
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,200
on the you if I API the

834
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,900
we country girl for or could the

835
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,120
when for example is a a

836
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,040
a to function exit with services is
called

837
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,040
the January just before was ok and then
it is a

838
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,130
the can I don't report it is called so
it's

839
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,840
to ninety another way maybe to do it is
to

840
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,340
advocates the reserve either memory

841
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,990
weaver euphoria internet function and
the

842
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:36,160
next exists a does this mean we a

843
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,180
no money will not from not be used a

844
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,370
by the operating system a

845
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:45,990
so it's maybe and those are the two
words a would get colder

846
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,480
memory and to avoid the

847
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,350
in to to stage a addition in the

848
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,820
and anti-u_s_ the location to burn next
week eccentric 84

849
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,530
so maybe we can to avoid the menu a
Turkish in

850
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,550
mayor reserve really the specific memory
for you if I

851
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,260
and next I think there is a

852
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,280
protesting too

853
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,930
on the reserve somewhere

854
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,260
some for non-military show which shoe
are you interests in a

855
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,710
in a tonight is day two to protect me

856
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:24,710
enters 22 and the

857
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:28,490
of course your could be right very
interesting to

858
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:32,380
to look at secure boot the music because
actual users with kids

859
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,859
the do not buy price anything doing that
by fast secure boot

860
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:41,079
if it is activated a between to a
between a truck

861
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:44,420
as it's not just a sign so I think there
is a

862
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,730
menacing to to to

863
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:51,700
to check a in insecure which so

864
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,529
sky was mustering in the UEFA has been a
returned from scratch

865
00:56:56,529 --> 00:57:00,900
the there are ok but I'm sure over not
but it isn't

866
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,710
in its thank you for

867
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,329
redemption
