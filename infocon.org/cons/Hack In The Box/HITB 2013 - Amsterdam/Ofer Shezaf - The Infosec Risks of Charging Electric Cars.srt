42
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,849
innings say later on in presentation

43
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,470
I'm glad to speak about us

44
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,440
I charging electric cars in particular
and

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,080
smart grid in general non saddam because

46
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,540
a the Netherlands you very early adopter
all

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,080
on electric cars on what I do you
mentioned before

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,720
is that the reason I can speak about arm

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,890
charging in the security of charging

50
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,040
used in between doing research in
product management

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,959
security product I spent three years
working for a company that the

52
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,760
infrastructure for charging

53
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,400
electric cars on the company's better
place

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,860
I it's a an upstart raise more than a
billion dollar or

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,879
to install infrastructure for charging

56
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,580
electric vehicles a dissing here is
actually it's

57
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,440
people are poor are you may see when you
go there are

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,769
if you go to your phone too dear
tomorrow him fly out

59
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,780
on eats not for charge in car

60
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,900
for switching columnist Carl on a better
place and use was that

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,830
since electric cars gone wrong on 50
kilometres on one battery

62
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,840
if you want to drive more you just got
to a place like that

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,580
and are your bothering speech soon get a
new bothering you can go on

64
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,490
I so I was actually up on the left for
in two and a half years ago

65
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,130
on the team I building these in
interesting

66
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,419
our site I and when I was here

67
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,349
probably twice along I'll when I was
working for a better place

68
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:00,510
one of them was are a whole week of %uh
starts poverty on securing the

69
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,490
communication between

70
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,520
cars charging stations I actually

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,659
at the time three or four years ago are
charging stations were very rare

72
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,000
I byways question anybody here

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,200
has electric car ok wall

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,860
megan's law I'll anybody

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,680
never saw charge station that's nice

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,800
most if you're touching is dollar menu
so

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,169
I'll when I came here I action

78
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,750
to have to see if you want to see the
canals the charge stations

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,960
in the pictures you're a pitcher Zach 2q
four years ago

80
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,620
the first so the charging stations in
ask done in time

81
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,310
okay what are we going to talk about
today

82
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,610
so %uh for unfortunately because i think
is very interesting but it's all very

83
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,770
secure you know

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,140
I I'll have to spend a bit of time on

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,640
smart or why do we need

86
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,870
are more than just simple

87
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,270
I'll to chart our course because of
course

88
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,870
security risks up call the fact that

89
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,430
we need to smart charging need a home
computer to help us

90
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,830
and charger or so what's going to be on
two of time on dat

91
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,630
letter on are going to the security for
are discussed billy's

92
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,289
I know that's what is important always
you know the actual

93
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,399
taking stuff I that said

94
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,229
you heard along on last couple days and

95
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,580
all safe few new things all safe few
things which are

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,390
solve common to every system so if you
saw somebody thinking

97
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,909
a auction on camera because it is a you
can import

98
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:49,310
I'll show you the charset also isn't
uniform

99
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,680
a NBC learn Wing I'll so I want to spend
some time

100
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,190
there and show you holding that

101
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,469
but I don't want to and their own to do
beyond

102
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,620
one important aspect you doing discuss

103
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,750
stand being big corporate guy

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,830
is what israel responded should be care

105
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,010
why bother are lastly there's a section
that I actually ended

106
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,080
last night or this morning because you
know coming to this conference I found

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,599
out that

108
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,159
there are so many talks about taking
physical things

109
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,750
know from her plans to use or networks
to

110
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,990
alarm systems Caro's

111
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,640
and therefore but I never hear any
real-world packs are on that

112
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,180
why is that and I want to touch a bit on
that

113
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,320
and I'll get pretty far away

114
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,899
and I'll mention Charles Darwin for a
moment

115
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,760
so my view interest

116
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,349
and the slimmest call for work

117
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,890
okay smarter electric cars why don't you
smart card why can't we just

118
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,209
get home talk to the mall and gather

119
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:11,209
who's your car so few charges I'll

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,830
its one-child I'll

121
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,550
first one is that we need to charge on
the streets and parking lots

122
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,940
so no everyone who's been traveling
you're all trains ramblings no

123
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,339
a used to be very hard to find logs all
mean

124
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,149
terminals in in train stations it's a
bit easier to date still challenge

125
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:36,320
instance just don't have sue

126
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,130
hours you're able to just charge it home

127
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,190
and unless you have a private home

128
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,769
you need socket solvents on streets

129
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:49,930
on don't have today moreover

130
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,830
some years to pay for electricity there
soon in a way to you

131
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,700
I'll deal I want to see charged with its

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,510
Singh weren't so views for using those
of its

133
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,380
but he's not going there's a huge issues
the model

134
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,080
Houston Union I'll its own issue today

135
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,320
he's actually they went up from that be
but

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,830
if her of the cars in the Netherlands
Lindsay

137
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm guessing three million cars the
electric

138
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,550
each one of them take thirty two arms on
charging

139
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,519
you do the calculation you get to
something which is more than the

140
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,330
European

141
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,690
parcel I'll its law

142
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,830
so there's a chance there were jobs
local national level

143
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,030
the charge also local level you have in
employee parking lot of people come

144
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,230
during the morning

145
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,300
need to charge it won't be able to get
back home

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,880
ivory for the charge the same time there
won't be enough

147
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,550
car and and in the income interesting
connection

148
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,110
provide used them all something has to
be done

149
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,540
in this respect last name

150
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,940
whitewater electric cars in the first
place morning person

151
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,410
first place because we mourn greener
farm

152
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,410
but im to see in denver is also me

153
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,740
of solving in a process that may not be
green

154
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,190
so nor to justify electric cars may need
to

155
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,300
make sure did filters to provide

156
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,340
use green no crew Tuesday

157
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,850
is challenging because it's not one you
want

158
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,540
Wentzville Sooners win for Arkansas

159
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,320
or and maybe not today nose or

160
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,190
artist here I we you something that
happens

161
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,950
neither during the day or morphine so
you want to make sure that

162
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,120
I'll cars are charging when

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,430
Green Energy's available one of the
biggest hostages of electric car

164
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,290
use in to YouTube other and his
resolving use Valerie

165
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,830
10 actually chart when juries

166
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,270
run when the interest is needed

167
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,010
even more that you never heard about
those there is a long term plan or

168
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,150
vision it eulogy cars

169
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,310
as a doc so not just

170
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,110
are to have the electric cars charges
right time but actually

171
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,080
I'll to enable electric cars to provide
use invective agreed

172
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,460
so if you have a car you have a long
time because from time to time

173
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,320
do you go to them boss a but usually
just travel

174
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,420
you know from the sovereign from in
sometimes

175
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,370
you to see are so you get working used
to have any person to be bothering

176
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,660
cool so do the you stand there in the
parking lot you connect to the charging

177
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,450
station

178
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,290
are and you can get more increases the
risk 20 percent but

179
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,080
you can sell them your bottom line back
to the greed

180
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,890
sis having all those premium batteries
all other

181
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,790
as are caution to are regulate or

182
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,840
enable more use of green power

183
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,150
so just to summarize this part then

184
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,890
visionary ones are going to college in I

185
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,370
as a customer if I'm not into green
energy I want to get interesting now

186
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,130
to pay me know and to make it easy and
it's not an easy keep in mind you have

187
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,590
to be home

188
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,980
whenever you get and where you park you
take people out but which are stationed

189
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,300
back to the car

190
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,700
swipe are for the card for payment part
art or just getting on the car in going

191
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,920
anymore

192
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,340
on the other hand I the charging

193
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,810
processes to take in to consider local
capacity

194
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,610
I of of of in the parking lot on

195
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,760
a rewarding part I
national/international

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,970
bessie dream power and last

197
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,090
until you mention there's also the
aspect of our talk

198
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,279
of managing the battery life I mean

199
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
you have a lot of homework devices and
they've got a reason those mother is

200
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,710
usually die after you

201
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,230
and then you from him when buying you
one because it's

202
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,980
I don't 10 euros 10 years

203
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,980
recovery is 10,000 euros soon or

204
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,590
thrown away after one year you need to
make sure that you charged the right

205
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,510
wing

206
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,180
specifically it's around I temperatures
on

207
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,240
charged amendments to of are

208
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
to call stuff like that

209
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,710
ok so we need smart charging

210
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,210
so I don't want to get doesn't dislike
but smart charging

211
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,960
starts to be complex IT system

212
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,320
it has a lot of elements me are they're
easy to use the comp unneeded

213
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,980
generates and this result reason and
they know how much is available

214
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,440
are nationally and in many cases also
locally

215
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,760
then there is someone who might be a
different company might be the same

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,810
phone use in charge of

217
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,779
charging services actually is connected
to the charges for

218
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,450
and determined charging plan to discuss
next slide

219
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,720
are going to each car or then you have

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
to try her who's making the request for
charging

221
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,860
I connects I and usually would like some

222
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,270
have additional services doctor on in
order to check billing

223
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,550
change for more if there is enough power
company the car

224
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,260
so it's an awesome OVR always be also
you need

225
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,580
I and then we have the charts for
themselves which are this region

226
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,910
and Iran a in many cases they will be

227
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,910
at homes so I'll prime

228
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,110
Arkham position

229
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,250
I so we've gone to someone in many other
cases the only managers group

230
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,650
so you have our Corporate Park Mall

231
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,480
you lots commercial parking lots are

232
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,730
your mall might have a few Park and

233
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,029
charging stations available

234
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,980
harm I mention worried would be I just
like to mention that the requirements

235
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
for each one of those charging

236
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,330
positions is different when you get home
you have the entire night and you want

237
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,630
to be for the next morning

238
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,920
when you get warm are some employees

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,040
stay all day summer sales people the new
easy fast

240
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,400
when you get to our shopping mall New
Jersey I N

241
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,420
now

242
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,160
someone has to generate a charge plant
someone has to be

243
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,450
smarting minute charging based on
customer requirements

244
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,160
and availability to essentially tryin
national

245
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,589
use from something like that which you
people come on pop

246
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,779
just burst networking something
manageable

247
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,150
in the civil case just delay the Charter
most

248
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,510
in the you cars wrong

249
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,810
immediately when they come home in today
early are morning

250
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,510
which is the simplest case or managing
charge nationwide

251
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,890
so each car won't have some charge plan
isn't

252
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,950
starts now get enough snow is not empty

253
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,430
stock prices morning incident all those
are pretty complex systems will require

254
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,960
some smart charging mechanism someone in
central

255
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,300
to manage that one thing to keep in mind

256
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,640
the smart charging if I go get style of

257
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,760
process consul wants while is a
requirement is a national

258
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,490
borrowing it is the tickets are side
important

259
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,850
personal requirement is to have interest
in now as fast as possible nearly always

260
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:37,060
so there's also a question about bonds
between usually baby based on price

261
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,290
you're really to I'll getting busy later
you paid

262
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,440
in one way or another less

263
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
so that's good too

264
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,529
the so in order to

265
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,540
implement this consul there's something
called

266
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,779
charge station those are for different
kinds of charge stations

267
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,800
those are just different polls are made
by

268
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,449
companies usually launch electric a

269
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,600
even companies I'll mention geology

270
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,600
later %um I'm not so positive way so

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,079
because they have the nicest ones here
on the left

272
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,980
I and the rest are on his

273
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,260
I'll seniors are mean and translations

274
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,870
arm so I'm

275
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,970
d a you start begun commodities

276
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,020
northern Chile journey to beat were

277
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,820
due to security issues surname what he's
in charge station

278
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,730
social charge station and choose one
dupes where 120

279
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,510
but Israel one I use the computer on
street

280
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,399
you there's an all-city I it has
something to face

281
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:57,789
and it is a qAME has also what people
born 20 use computer on street

282
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,140
let's look at the details all

283
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,520
are these charts in so it has

284
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,850
two sides one of them will be there
electronics

285
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,160
the computers on the electrical part the
doomed

286
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,260
interrupt between them I do I need to
say those three parties

287
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,280
department people do take care of
security no

288
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,340
simply upon on the computer in part to
have sup

289
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,800
mainboard are more more

290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,090
it's our job purpose: I'll

291
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,690
at least arm-based you my chances

292
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,240
run Linux are if not some other embedded
operating system

an you'll see you lawrence's might be
just

302
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,890
our buzzer let something like that I

303
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,830
one thing worth mentioning I don't
discussing their own presentations or

304
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,059
another area used in

305
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:27,500
some of them not a large number accept
credit cards

which gets you into the balkans
persecute you wall I N

311
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,440
are and then you need some communication
Bay

312

in-home Tom darkness in ways to do that

313
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,670
I'll discuss them I'll

314
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,700
I want to set something portable all
that stuff

315
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,490
while prime factors did release was
little securities cost

316
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,630
this quality products on Gardiner

317
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,280
on stories are many of them and they
need to be cheap

318
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,920
and we got there you need to be to you
I'll very

319
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,030
are may not be what you

320
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:26,840
chosen for security reasons I'll do you
good example

321
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,360
so whoever stays in the cell probably
has

322
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,260
as such a carp are checked out

323
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,140
mine the car with me you use

324
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,390
are finding so

325
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,740
this car designed that I reject Allen
you back

326
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,760
so i the reason I want to implementation
but most people don't

327
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,440
so it has to be very few if cost

328
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,080
2 euros it's much better if both
partners

329
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,690
as a result those cars and stuff where
are you the not the latest

330
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,210
morning on and in many cases they are

331
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,580
hackable are so while

332
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,290
small heart and you can buy

333
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,150
officials you the compliment

334
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,679
in many cases people use non-secure
moment another example we'll see

335
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,640
so I'm writing GSM wifi CBN are as much
so

336
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,730
connection r Jones speaking GSM will be
the most secure but it's very common

337
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,350
expensive two images in connection for
it while the transports

338
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,740
and different many cases you see the a
number of chars was jokin same place

339
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,070
are connected by serial connection which
is just a moment

340
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,360
I and the have just seen you use in
connection

341
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,049
to the network and is your connection is
a major are

342
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,790
rebuilding on the electrical sign

343
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,040
I'll I just want to mention I

344
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,360
20 months I there's the meter

345
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,650
the electricity meter I won't go into
details but of course one of fraud

346
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,220
cases dewey's fine does medicaid

347
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,620
digital used in main computer

348
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,170
so I metering fraud is an easy way ones
you later on too much

349
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,280
the arm penniless

350
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,870
the other side and are simply the

351
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,410
protection mechanism a

352
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,600
usually the he's well protected from
electronic so you don't just

353
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,670
play with it on and from the commuters

354
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,040
computers and things there is an
interesting aspect to that

355
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,620
a which is wrong safety side
informations

356
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,330
I'll when you have a printer a

357
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,510
has to a jump it has to you

358
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,960
opens you if there is and any

359
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,010
dangerfield fusions no if something goes
wrong

360
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,010
has to you you all of you have those
protections against

361
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,059
home Andy go down and then you go and
take up

362
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:13,710
dewey's or English in every country did

363
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,799
it has to be of some use to go to her
and take up

364
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,880
the protections I unfortunately this is
very expensive when it gets to send

365
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,080
ignition

366
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,150
to take up are anywhere in the city thin
crust yuck porn

367
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,580
you're not just to you fix a small thing

368
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,970
so there is a tendency to try have it

369
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,130
more control a but this is this because
information security

370
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,580
other because that means that you and
you've known bizarre all their

371
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,679
becomes turn a people may be all set to
play music safety

372
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,309
element of the electrical see

373
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:55,340
and one thing to keep in mind is that

374
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,850
a it's not just the computer students
and mentor Street

375
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,900
I mentioned it its connected in many
cases a few of them are connected

376
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,040
locally

377
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,270
I and then through some why the
reconnection

378
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,210
either to controls and belonging to
trust operator

379
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,000
or in other cases local into the
building management system so

380
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,640
da cases were Avenger is selling are

381
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,890
to I'll company five or ten charge
stations

382
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,160
wind Corporate Park Mall and dad are not
connected that we're going to a

383
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,549
management system

384
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:32,740
at the company which just makes you the

385
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,640
local are limit on charging is not see
them

386
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,059
so that simple

387
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,419
okay and I'll what you've been fit
waiting for

388
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:49,290
I love in billings are up

389
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,360
appointees we I you work from and we'll
discuss it later in the philosophical

390
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,860
part of things and I Design Systems you
were normal

391
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,110
I trying to find publicly available

392
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,760
examples you checking show you these
I'll

393
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,270
without compromising after all your
orange p.m.

394
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,700
in like if I just the school is

395
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,090
I and you get that's part of

396
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,530
on you work who will discuss then why
doesn't happen so much

397
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:23,790
so the first issue used physical absence

398
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,640
those are systems on the streets and
it's very to get views of

399
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,299
taking them apart is very easy two ways
you can

400
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,120
just order to the street on

401
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,610
and other way used to buy the equipment
I think you

402
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,580
I won't be there you in the opposition
have mentioned about 20

403
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,770
are acting you read about both those on
my tits

404
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,370
up when you actually get your hands on
the equipment reverse engineering is

405
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,090
usually much

406
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,360
easier then what one thing I'll

407
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,470
this is used themselves and you purports

408
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,490
and was only if you can this morning is
from parking

409
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,549
example are has no

410
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:08,140
I'll prior a

411
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,290
boxing which is you mechanism to prevent

412
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:16,940
message nearing of electric in suits you
if you go to Highland secure

413
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,230
are models such as does the store keys
in Ben's

414
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,990
you have a talk seemed off key
electrical elements to protect them from

415
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,270
resin

416
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,760
nothing here so in most Rd concerns i've
seen

417
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,240
in bed systems I the bulk ports

418
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,730
all the processors are available in once
you're in it you can connect using the

419
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,780
McCourts

420
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,230
I'll another interesting method

421
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,700
peace physically one art form same smart
official before

422
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,190
is X-rayed I mean are shown in Example
later on

423
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,059
the spark roger was able to know them a
call and therefore I was able to get

424
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,200
more information about

425
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,220
I'll arm x3

426
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,040
but if you have nothing and I checked
there is nothing your goal to make to

427
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,870
cart

428
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,580
probably 50 X really don't know very
easy the warning

429
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,880
mother who's been arm

430
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,390
why won't work so first of all

431
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:19,169
sorry his cock or small it's a great you
strong point you your name

432
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:22,570
harm min be with us so you think
reclusive UN

433
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,780
into a break point on see on the soft
orange

434
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,679
the controller I can stop execution
midway are

435
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,860
and I can for example are get

436
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,940
are than and use you're into

437
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,720
are I defend personal you services

438
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,410
a are things that we'll get to that
later

439
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,860
like every security mechanism duping
he's involved in

440
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,350
securing communication and billing and

441
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,950
in most cases good artist Bihar you get
the keys I'll

442
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,950
the keys used for these a are for the
time just mentioned

443
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:05,110
wielded with Iran

444
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,240
home another I'll formal point eases
your communication

445
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll your parking lot you want to
install derm

446
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,380
$50 charge stations you want opening

447
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,740
its way to extend expensive to just have

448
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,539
on an Ethernet cable going to eat while
are

449
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:27,620
the I don't anyone who do you like you
you fucking

450
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,770
it's a couple minutes if you are in
euros per

451
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,770
connection a lot of warm and it's not

452
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,660
the convo no morning so many times
what's us use for their

453
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,059
some people Rs 45 which is I'll

454
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,410
your version of ours to free two weeks
of use to me remember

455
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,630
for your once every proven miles
learning to the computer this way I

456
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,250
don't think I have

457
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,490
a serial connection anymore I don't have
one

458
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,740
a but those systems to Houston the funds
move to drop system

459
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,870
so you can connect one cable I

460
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,660
which you can just pulled alongside
electrical cables with you

461
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,870
any meaning a chance to he needs a
connection to a cheesy after all

462
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,210
on and but that's where you get thank
you to all stations very easy

463
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,780
charges that this is a very very very
long been

464
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,039
system when you have house cable

465
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,090
she's not have heard of when you have to
go to three floors inside

466
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,100
a parking lot to go to these corners you
select nor

467
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,840
to to charging stations you get to as
much as

468
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,160
100 few minutes per second

469
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,460
for all Chur

470
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,230
so that's not law of information

471
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,070
around who in here ever head

472
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,070
you design particles orville anything
for such home

473
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,610
I frequencies I don't want all

474
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,740
here no you're not holding up agreement

475
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,840
a it's very limiting uses a lot of
things

476
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,100
30 so used to you you

477
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,309
is farms and is security

478
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,679
yugos are not possible moreover

479
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,320
ours forty-five by itself is just an
electrical stand-up

480
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,360
of certain occasion insufferable alright

481
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,799
what's you use a little more bus and
more us

482
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,280
is to you very very simple protocol

483
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,480
social issues to make sure that the
masteries

484
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,510
splitting time between the different
stations because you don't want

485
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,510
and toward the same time I and dozens

486
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,590
you so and upper-level application may
insecurity

487
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,710
usually does my experiences usually

488
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,110
I authentication you secure

489
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,500
but the information is not snow for
example

490
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,720
are you'll be able to K die

491
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,990
your infringement is charging even if
you won't be able to

492
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,440
communities charting then-sen it's all
prior use all

493
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,780
invented by the vendor and men and you
know that some

494
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,950
very easy just make new other

495
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,090
Hill a dougans March 25 are available
anymore

496
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,530
and you movie nearly everything

497
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,980
if it's in control

498
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,590
next are finding on

499
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,400
are for the he's more for discussion are
funny by itself is not ans

500
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,530
through technology on what was already
said can

501
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,850
again a whole new world security a

502
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,590
were an entire presentation might want
to spend a few minutes and that

503
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,660
on dark few would you say are fade

504
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,910
or actually since a contactless
smartcard

505
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,350
I imply one of several mom

506
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,380
standards the first one will be I saw
14:04 for free

507
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,530
this is just the most accused on our
potentially most

508
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,799
star and along with anxious to do you
use it

509
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,370
if you have papers from Pune

510
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,679
create cart close credit card you will
be based

511
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,679
on these two morning

512
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,409
an alternative ecology I sold 50 CC 93

513
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,730
a has the advantage imports from be for
dinner

514
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,270
so it's compass is not be the
consequence consequences

515
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,580
uses less it has to be very close
doesn't work

516
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,860
I 5693 works from

517
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,230
beat for dinner so these abilities
better

518
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,950
but it has less power you minded contact
us

519
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,370
and smart cards are the car process

520
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,110
works on the energy received from the
year

521
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,240
so if you go for dinner you can have
less intrusive likes

522
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,280
energy and you can do list so you can't
really have a smart process was there

523
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,580
so you'll probably have I just

524
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,010
the best secure memory on started
competing next slide

525
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:09,299
lastly their tongs of I say all the
relation promising cheaper

526
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,299
are memory alling really

527
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,780
RF I me device not just

528
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,620
really good night from the mall use use
no security

529
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,830
and our implementation in touch use does

530
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,880
so first of all it's very easy to store

531
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,240
I have a lien year I to using project
that shows you

532
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,080
religion by you've been to use a police
in

533
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,490
I'll for even a beat for androgen

534
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,940
the actual card is used to I'll

535
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,049
the actual traffic between the corn
reader so

536
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:49,480
Easter ease any you secure on particle
it's very easy to bring

537
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,700
and I'll talk more than nice light a

538
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,220
do what are pretty much more fun to use
the

539
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,960
smart cards are a blocking points for

540
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,640
fixing insistent the wild

541
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,349
don't actually feel so you have to
replace all

542
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:14,359
essentially at the same time used up
doing all the readers in order to you

543
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,079
fix anything so dull reasons that

544
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,559
like a lot of physical systems if you
have any

545
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,089
the field it's going to stay here just
I'll

546
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,710
as an example a very local one a

547
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,210
the smart card because marker used by
the

548
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,429
Dutch I'll probation the movie cards

549
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,149
have been known to be hackable since

550
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:45,389
2000 a something that

551
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:49,740
and I think that last you the star
placing

552
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,389
soon they've been known to be hackable

553
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,579
for use is my questions white this for a
while

554
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:01,349
all DRI's nobody

555
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,390
there was no huge an internationalist
that Mitchell getting the flu something

556
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,769
for

557
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:09,059
again but it's just hard it's hard place

558
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:12,229
the physical card

559
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:15,609
I'll let's go onto photography

560
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:20,799
so

561
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,979
the end of the day the coles is
confident smart cards to you do one of

562
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:26,190
two things either

563
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,559
to provide syndication but I jeans

564
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,559
terminar secure means that

565
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,609
only the cardholder can and then find
his ID

566
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,170
nobody can just copy the car keep in
mind a

567
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,150
mechanics try parties just call people
is knowing

568
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,549
and the application doesn't want to use
mark or

569
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,839
use using stored will use it to start
some

570
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,359
and beam mine

571
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,430
an electric one so to speak and

572
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,829
E car charging applications may use I'd

573
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:03,049
both its small money

574
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:06,609
might be Stormville in many cases it is
based on

575
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:09,779
identification now

576
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:13,210
I'll leave the home from now

577
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,700
a does smart cards don't know in common
and artist

578
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,599
used I'll go to those that do you

579
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,859
the most common way to use encryption
smart cards

580
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:27,339
used to use I shared key

581
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:30,410
scheme in which both I

582
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,849
the reader and the car not the same

583
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:39,759
are the diagram you which is not very
common stock into

584
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:43,680
from one get with now if you have any
questions companies over comments

585
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,069
is almost done is charged for mechanism
between

586
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,460
I'll reader and the cart is what

587
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,469
be catching up here you have

588
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:57,390
I'll tens of thousands of readers nor

589
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,880
transforms and you have hundreds of
thousands all

590
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,789
cards they all have terms same key

591
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,670
I was being comes day way way more this
nickens one or more

592
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,529
and most systems are used strewn

593
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:18,619
key now it's true for public
transportation as well

594
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,880
by public transportation not offering
jerseys

595
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,799
I'll percent or 10 percent of the number
transports

596
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:30,609
expect in the future but it's also call
for problems with vision systems

597
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,940
arm so does your he's our nation knife

598
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,170
recall I also mentioned that one of the

599
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,079
involve actually opening the charge
station and connecting to the man

600
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,269
order you'll be able to get the keys up

601
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:49,269
on the car keys are somewhat more
protected

602
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,829
on the charge station because very hard
think than

603
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:58,180
the key the keys so this is a major
challenge

604
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,640
a this is what other aspect of

605
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,789
symmetric using skis also on skill well
if you want to have

606
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:08,809
roaming now is pal transportation you

607
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:12,289
usually not using E chart carlson's

608
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,880
marquardt in different countries when
you

609
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,769
moon to you charging and want government
to Belgium you want to continue charging

610
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,529
when you reach Belgian

611
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:25,859
are so you have to have some subtype
froing single to sell law

612
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,319
and arm si metric used by

613
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:33,569
all seasons across Europe would not for

614
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,190
security wise on that's an

615
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,279
this will not be the only problem
because in reliance

616
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:43,529
I'll a lot because of costumes the

617
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,239
are in use by smart cards are not very
strong

618
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:50,819
so as I mentioned did in my life Eric
argues in

619
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:53,859
Dutch I'll religion system has

620
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:57,969
our primary and configuring were used in
the last year

621
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:04,969
call troop 21 witches brew

622
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,539
and now so that's what about our fight
the cards

623
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:13,859
I let's move to I'll protocols

624
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,469
are exhaust and in the Haunted charge
station saw

625
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:22,170
but if you move your own star station
you get into arm

626
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,059
communication with the world used-car I
and

627
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:31,170
with the win you cannot argue some I'll
control something

628
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,759
I'll

629
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:38,049
the issues does particles union this is
a real world example

630
00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:41,469
I mean they're probably to real
protocols

631
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:44,910
today in this world one thing is
actually Dutch

632
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,920
I'll buy and sell from hold you up she's

633
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,829
managing charge stations in the knowns
also on saddam

634
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,849
another American back on legal charge
point

635
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,160
morph are naturally kweisi of and
proprietary

636
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,880
result home scrutiny on

637
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,940
in this case I need to say I can find
Billy I'll

638
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,109
but it again I extras for you because

639
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:12,069
the condition can receive if you ask one
it's not open on the web

640
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:15,180
and I you ask for on the charge on one

641
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:20,099
I'll run we could go on reeling I'll let
you know if I find anything

642
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,380
I'll though I asked y'all did

643
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,509
proper although the official protocol
between charge station and control

644
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:28,380
center which

645
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,430
sense does charged in plans

646
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,140
and that's that it has to be managed
remotely because you want a more

647
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,249
preventive maintenance cost and you know
a lot of cases

648
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:42,130
do is more than just the official for
all

649
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,269
for example I sent so insistent

650
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:49,009
so in more than one intention I found in
targets

651
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:52,180
more accessible using SSH cynicism

652
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,950
the of course because you want if you
see someone from

653
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,759
I did you get a message in S&P charges

654
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:03,859
keep in mind that of insurgent S&P can
be secure

655
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:07,839
but is a huge charger almost many he's

656
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,039
or possible going on on G for a large
amount of gas stations

657
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,459
if you you think of my you know that is
going to challenge you

658
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:22,259
hundred serbs so nothing about a
situation where you have

659
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:25,420
10,000 machines you sort of keep

660
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,829
use for other very smart key management
system or issues like you for always

661
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,989
way to calm which means the

662
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:38,880
a against the internet there things up

663
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
an one side she's

664
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,849
law there is one interesting thing here
I'll

665
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,529
disrupted due to security so it's just
going to picture nothing new year

666
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:53,319
are those systems you didn't mention
that girl did the end point is that

667
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:56,519
everyone wants to control coming from
his phone

668
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:01,119
no how follows the car on how much they
pay me

669
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,499
I'll Ste please give you to sit down

670
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:07,869
do you plan to give me on in our time I

671
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,239
because I'm going to leave before him
expected to

672
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:14,459
soldiers were aspect that a

673
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:18,809
usually managed by either day charging
provide their

674
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:22,049
or by defender of the in

675
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:26,489
charge stations for example GE who's not
a charging provider

676
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:31,140
use have closest and in charge station
owners

677
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,489
and costumes can connect to

678
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:38,160
in order to are does all services and
those

679
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,910
to I by services by serves me

680
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,249
located an official launch our station

681
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:48,319
are prices in right-center so

682
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,309
this is an example of how I charge
station owner

683
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:56,239
well-defined billing rules for anybody
connected translation of course a bill

684
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:57,650
from his mama law

685
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,709
just victim moment is a security

686
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,269
a more interesting example I far was a

687
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:07,589
General Electric I'll

688
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:12,099
web service for for party applications i
have a web service to the name of the

689
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:13,609
football implication

690
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:18,070
to in the come access the

691
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,840
their service and provide some I'll

692
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,880
features and wrong chargement for so

693
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,540
this jury instructions as to how you
want I'll send the key

694
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,820
in with your application are so you're

695
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,390
register to the GV website for that you
think user and pass for an embedded in

696
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,260
your application

697
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,350
great security

698
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,060
of course it's pretty call in this field
because

699
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,180
the risks that I mean its

700
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,650
a few its infancy are you know every
band

701
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,910
or social network company

702
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,970
as local working rounds remember axes

703
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,040
it's not G business of

704
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,500
lasting

705
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,820
are problem you know min

706
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,200
maybe should start with that a demos

707
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,400
I'll stirring bar thing

708
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,960
use going back today in physical side of
things

709
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,550
I'll the highest cost %um

710
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,930
running arm

711
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:32,110
charging network is not the hardcore
it's not even if you see

712
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,930
its maintenance you know

713
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,080
men powers of Thrones is was the most
costly

714
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,410
and therefore maintenance procedures

715
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,830
are keep are all me

716
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,490
any such system and so I won't look into
how to maintain

717
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,580
again energy charge for that geez not
the worst company just going to rise

718
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,290
most important information on the web

719
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,620
which is be b.com and so i won

720
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,760
into how do you manage to your charge
station

721
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,290
and goes that way you go

722
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:11,180
and you open the boxes inky the ski

723
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,100
physical you know member does use the
last makers you mean

724
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,600
you open box and then you have

725
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,290
to change its reach in the congressional

726
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:27,730
must changed it his mission to
congressional

727
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,820
you connect to you then rj-45

728
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,440
socket was your computer and most
fundamental byways instructions for

729
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,220
getting

730
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,110
maintains got a hold of you didn't I his
notebook for local connection

731
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:47,160
then you open a browser crossed the line
9168 don't 2.2

732
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,430
and you get the configuration interface
no

733
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,140
against you the possible stage there was
no costing

734
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,410
now of course they're leaving his
answers to all of you

735
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,250
now song present is in focus on the step

736
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,820
I wonder what would happen just on

737
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,700
SCANA against this connection how many
other ports all concur

738
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,190
my guess is more than one that's my
experience

739
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,600
with up systems I think G

740
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,910
no so if anybody ever guess that up to
your knees up

741
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,080
so maintenance is a key issue keep in
mind or

742
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,710
you should be 10 zahar is on the streets

743
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:36,780
you go open connecting your in and keep
in mind and best song goes back to know

744
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,550
two previous life for a moment if this
protocol

745
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,080
between the charge station the control
center easy anyway not secure enough

746
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:51,010
or based on keys that are embedded in
the charge station you just broke into

747
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:55,640
you getting convoys and as well which is
crucial for

748
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,130
Minnesota flights so

749
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,720
those songs were over billions but
others are not interesting

750
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,430
or might be interesting I they don't
provide any value to the heck is long

751
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,940
my question is what are two priests are

752
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,870
what can really happen and I don't miss
your nose

753
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,220
does our stories collagen more just
combining

754
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,850
what you can do it yourself it's worth
mentioning and focus on those

755
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:29,200
cannot reveals all promised privacy

756
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,120
I've stifles the free which is nature
and I was asking

757
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,950
I doing France or stealing money which
is also

758
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,320
an easy since I'm I would like to
mention two hours and hours which are

759
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,090
more unique

760
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:44,740
to charging station the first official
he's now of

761
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,890
service but I think I'll computing
services I'll

762
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,350
charging or Parsons so keep in mind

763
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:56,950
up if and when and charging stations are
becoming

764
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,460
call please we'll reluctant rely on

765
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,600
and gas stations today you know in for a
world usually one of the worst thing

766
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,340
that can happen is shown

767
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,260
guess is many people stock in long lines

768
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,480
now somebody can even

769
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,910
in a small area prevent charging from
everyone

770
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,060
you have a major disturbance to you too
public

771
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,650
life someone could do it on large-scale
for example

772
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,450
find a way to change if you were all all

773
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,750
are in charge station a unit for

774
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,990
might be I'll really really deep wrong

775
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,830
just titles answer I mention S&P being
used to control

776
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,230
are charge stations one of the main
reasons I'll you more

777
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:47,670
a so that's something to keep in mind
it's not just about charging cars

778
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:51,780
well I mentioned that the reason to lose
more charging

779
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,010
easy nor to make sure that everybody is
a three-city

780
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,040
to talk you something finds a way

781
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,380
to up to confuse and

782
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,850
make chart plans to have to any cost of
nursing

783
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,890
time the noun services not anymore just
trading cards on

784
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,650
going to sit in the first place example

785
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,030
locals youth in the company you have

786
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:21,260
10-15 car you make all turn the same
time

787
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,520
are if the company was more just the
breaker for me it's

788
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:30,090
going down if not the building in all
the war room's door

789
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,440
I said ask you listing music for

790
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,530
I just want to mention you that every 50
use very small it's only meaningful

791
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,960
someone finds a way to steal or

792
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,090
are dues of course

793
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,400
yes and privacy and that is a huge
question about contribution

794
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,850
though safety much means is that you
this

795
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,110
not being because when it gets physical
people

796
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,460
10 to get a

797
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,670
smart everything more on which is

798
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:04,630
you something to think about wine so the
security between

799
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,020
the controller and electrical parts is
really more

800
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,510
for all is more regulation also

801
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,540
okay solutions in a minute for minute

802
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,480
I what we do I it's not for was of the
presentation by

803
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,150
to mention that for civil at the end of
the a lot of things you were about cost

804
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,430
ample parking and protocols you think
about it

805
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,960
so it's hard to fix cost and people
saving money

806
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,990
amenities sprawls so we need we want to
make sure that

807
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,390
I'll you more more

808
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:45,200
westernization dimes in this field and
like always an open source guy

809
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,850
your to secure it is to be open
scrutinized and is always do

810
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,630
for locals here on that darn thing which
is key to securing such justice must

811
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,250
management I wanted launches holder here
but

812
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,530
and drive key is one of them

813
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,970
problem took to talk if he's of course
very useful long process usually more

814
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,130
expensive

815
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:11,650
on our scheme

816
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,780
and lost me are like always

817
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,820
you just have to pay more attention span
more money

818
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,340
last night a few thoughts about internal
things

819
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,150
so we have heard here news conference
acers

820
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,370
talks about thinking on plans thinking
though the electric green

821
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:35,470
and taking down %uh alarm systems

822
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,980
in ever you never happens

823
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,430
and causes why why so many talks why so
little hacking and

824
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,440
just cause of action was going back to
bentsen

825
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,210
you use information and it's a good
question

826
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,609
it's worth discussing so so this is not
a few reasons I want to highlight

827
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:56,680
and you can see a big last night because
he's taking from

828
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,910
a presentation in this conference so
what do you use that

829
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,800
its heart a lot of those positions were
done by someone is both a security

830
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,440
expert

831
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,300
in a subject matter expert hours
previews

832
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,380
doing electric charging stations sales
of

833
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,450
you weren't room but

834
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,460
hecker usually I webuser tech web sites

835
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,690
now not post say but

836
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:28,160
because if you already came here from
smartest bankers

837
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,370
but most things are not small so there
is a very 20 which is

838
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:35,440
considerable

839
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,340
more than that I think that in many
cases you'll find that

840
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,880
the help they need so his call simple
slide

841
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,520
it's not I mention X-raying

842
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,730
and smart or because it's hard work
torrent

843
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,830
and I mean this is a nice life

844
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,850
or on 44 presentation along her family

845
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,970
title reasons behind I've been just
imagine or speeding

846
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,220
I am you those are smart people

847
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,350
those are people to begin security and

848
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:12,070
mistaken for me g-money will be able to
you later on

849
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:15,690
here he asked the people who hears and

850
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,160
action be or someone who understands you
can

851
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,850
I'll eighty people are on for people
means

852
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,500
and a lot usable you can prime so it's
not easy

853
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:32,500
and those are just two examples it's
actually pretty hard

854
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,340
there's another you should know and
inspect where I live

855
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,140
remember 50 kilometers from Damascus

856
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,590
and I feel very safe so there's the
issue is perceived priest

857
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,850
one way or another people

858
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:53,210
Goldfields Res own while turmoil

859
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm 21 I one of course is the host

860
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,250
gorgeous not airplanes no our plans are
pretty

861
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,340
successful these days but all the things
we talk about knowing

862
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:08,890
during infancy so we mention students
infancy to assist in

863
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,650
it seems will question whether security
for trying like

864
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,620
vehicles mucho before up

865
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:22,340
actual electric cars the car on his
mature

866
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,520
now those the morals of the cost

867
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,190
that maybe we're just good don't want
that

868
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:34,359
and I don't think that people are you
don't want to have a few people have

869
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:38,960
very different call so when it gets to
be really physical

870
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,580
when its software hacking in this room
ordinance bans and bunnies

871
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,730
usual people to death when he gets to be
physical

872
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,580
people just don't do

873
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,980
I whoever you did the people thinking

874
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,870
in his past its prolly percent something
that

875
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,130
are and I'm also its way back in my past

876
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:06,620
are it's fun thank you dense web site
it's not fun to make an airplane

877
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:11,609
we have a very different mentality goes
you to all into the physical

878
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:15,750
any I think it's it's evolution

879
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,900
you know what we do just well enough yet
psychologically and physically

880
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,090
individual whirl on physical world

881
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,660
don't touch each other so much more
personal space

882
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,880
realist file on virtual Walmart haha
I'll

883
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,430
and we do a lot more so that's why those
things happen less

884
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:40,040
that said going back to my specific case
of Trustees is the reason you there

885
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,210
we should be I'll relaxing now

886
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,260
the risk us are small are going and

887
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,720
taken together they can especially when
the whole nation states

888
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,970
are can be pretty significant a

889
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:58,640
do affect basic service transportation
our ability to move from place to place

890
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,170
no do will become real when a few cars
become

891
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,320
so it's not know yet but it might be too
late by then

892
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,540
because those systems are systems upon
inbox

893
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,859
in the streets in harbor smart cards
cannot be

894
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:16,350
change overnight is not your windows

895
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,310
system saying I have patches please
install or frozen pet

896
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,390
something thanks used to batch so if you
don't start

897
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:29,150
day who this is humans important anyways

898
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,190
and I vision worker on electric cars no
that's next

899
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,890
one next year

900
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:43,890
thank you very much

901
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:46,829
we have some time yes any questions

902
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:51,939
a lot of the hacks

903
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:55,779
you discuss all physical access one
thing up

904
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:59,499
very early on you have physical access
all securities

905
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,499
pointless so cut forces that

906
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:07,049
if I have access electronics even if

907
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,049
the memory I can still get the key their

908
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:13,900
cell is we need to be smart

909
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,909
I'll give you one example is skewed
because the use of 13

910
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:20,569
in the solutions for don't want any keys

911
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:24,499
on the transition how to do that you

912
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:27,949
very interesting points to I have a
choice when design

913
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:31,789
those systems whether to put a key on
the train station

914
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:34,909
or have authentication

915
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:39,109
shots went online tourist here

916
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:43,479
use that I we'll would somebody comes
connects

917
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:46,849
and I have to continue to prop you gonna
using the resulting

918
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:49,859
thinking but I was willing to take this
reason

919
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:54,369
maybe lose a bit of money you're not
compromise the cuban

920
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:58,819
in the charge station so your issues for
you

921
00:57:58,819 --> 00:58:01,849
but we need me to go over them you
define always

922
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:06,159
the all don't think Internet of Things
force us

923
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,759
web security even dollars got so we need
to find

924
00:58:09,759 --> 00:58:12,819
right balance why mister so

925
00:58:12,819 --> 00:58:16,499
my main question for example what's
event from brief lasting

926
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:19,869
device mile firmware primarily have you
see

927
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:24,559
preventing that cause that's a really
interesting tax for me understand

928
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,880
in essence you need to have a charge for
work doesn't matter

929
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,989
I think you buy you can buy himself not
have to do them streets

930
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:35,549
uses bank merging we'd make sure you
charge station has no

931
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:38,630
role between the smart heart and center

932
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,909
more than local kinda pro local so

933
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:45,759
if you just managed to do something for
local charting

934
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:48,869
you know which prevented when we need to
make sure it's not going to get to the

935
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:49,650
center

936
