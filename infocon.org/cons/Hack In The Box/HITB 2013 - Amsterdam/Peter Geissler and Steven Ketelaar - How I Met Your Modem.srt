Google

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,910
okay I'll

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,730
yes

4
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,369
good morning everyone this is how much

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,660
today we're going to talk about yourself
us gonna talk about its

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,360
functionality and up up for religious we
find these

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,730
the firehouse expose forever

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,180
and we also a

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,000
demonstrated you up are so there

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,839
and some of the explosive growth before
we start

13
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,129
like to introduce ourselves up so

14
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,869
army our season

15
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,320
I software developer for also for
development company in the Netherlands

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,090
am outside a lot of security researcher

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,390
and I also liked jus elevator music

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,320
and I also play softball since you have

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,380
capture the flag as: with the I have not
seen it yet

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,749
T which Peter my phone speaker is also

21
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:34,890
borrow so I'm pure

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,380
also vertical or a small circle Tyler

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,749
a dreary day %uh her security researcher
or reverse engineer

24
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:48,810
whatever you want to call it these days
on over the hotel for later in the week

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,509
if I'll part of the handbooks a city of
troops from Dallas

26
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:57,490
a yeah pictures let's give

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,590
so introduction to us

28
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,780
is almost a yr why should we care about
them

29
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,420
so is the law is basically the fis
world-class

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,270
a stalls at all this user in order to
provide

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,130
this user with its collective T so
basically you with the use of a lecture

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,970
pocket watch computers for a little
while using a lot of

33
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,459
should be able to surf the internet %uh

34
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,920
social girl to I recently I'll

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,520
focusing on I'll scratch to security
ultimately

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,850
a and the fires BBC's up firewall
appliances

37
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,930
server solution your web server should
be secure

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,880
but nobody realizes a or switches

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,060
a other appliances or squeals computers

40
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,920
%uh weaker to old so it's basically like

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
store his research we want to find out
for us

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,310
for us whatever really a watch black
gloss

43
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,460
come easily to see what we can do

44
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,710
so over here

45
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,210
picture always I saw a lot of %uh it's
more or less the same or we have a stage

46
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,980
not exactly the same all those good I
have up so I saw you on the far left to

47
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,320
its own protection

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,170
where you find yourself %uh call of
course

49
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,740
which I use for tourism local areas were
so you've got your leftover

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,010
normal is the to hear a puzzle

51
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,660
I'll school horse we're going on a hotel
for

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,130
like what we have here their profile was
over

53
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,640
for a missile for the more so

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,640
ISP simplify some ulcer worse

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,380
there under all telephone of add to it
was a call

56
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,680
as if it were a rare let's go %uh of
course is a lotus

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,220
to arrest her well recent book for when
things go really wrong

58
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,900
Solis Pacific not always pictorial
presentation

59
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,010
it's the as I sold to a 6-2 you want to
expand

60
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,480
f1 from I'll their scores sykes oli
sykes Oliver

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,650
they're all very fond of so we a

62
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,380
exported it here no laws likely were
slices

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,389
will have access to undergo testing so
consolidation in some places for

64
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,250
Sri for Solarbuzz

65
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,590
futures of such is only for us I'll

66
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,039
fairly rough bills for providing us with
Texas

67
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,840
other governor says elections office or
access to a fire all is well

68
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,090
protect you from being up correctly but
it's coming from the internet

69
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,290
%uh as it was over IP telephony

70
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,340
up for Twitter to follow

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,510
abilities %uh and then choose who can
match them

72
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,570
truce on local which would faces
including this

73
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:01,220
key and for research occur

74
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,290
up networks a

75
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,720
you would see people saw a

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,820
picture here to see her eyes were set up

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,050
consists of one more with several or
connected devices such as a

78
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,120
not so or test shooter

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,460
maybe a server up for some gaming
consoles

80
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,090
perhaps southpaw and

81
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,260
always the files are connected to the
internet through cell

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,290
for which is connected from the motor

83
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,080
to a just left us these ISP sup

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,530
so

85
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,500
for us to have a little more flexibility
into

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,590
a testing with is the fastest modems we

87
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,440
up career a artists never set up

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,860
which actually goes into contest

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,960
networks nor a for me

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,710
at and that movie is not connected

91
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,310
for with it is so for

92
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,530
lot but its connected to the other

93
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,919
Sports Network K a through a

94
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,190
for even at is inevitable

95
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,460
court on the 14 katz et so

96
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,169
this way we can connect from to the low
side of the following number

97
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,280
be from the computers locally connected
to not for me but we can also connect to

98
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,820
a remote side of the morning that would
be

99
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,460
from the computers connective and that's
okay

100
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,160
and let's talk about

101
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,090
are set here because we don't have
internet access we don't have to sell

102
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,460
lot available we up

103
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,250
but the Collins part and we have only
one bar where instead of two

104
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,350
so what we did is we hooked up to a
server

105
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,730
faster see here to 1/4 and more

106
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,090
and we also accept this letter to lots
of

107
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:15,090
tomorrow and we also connected a for all
telephone up

108
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,120
so about the management its face that
are provided as-is or

109
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,650
good first thing we know it was ASAS

110
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,630
management interface which is very nice
because yeah we all like to use as a

111
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,199
but it's not a regular SH faces up like
a good drafts were

112
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,860
a regular pressurization but it's a
special session of

113
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,940
it's a show for it was nice of to match
your

114
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,729
up do more and at

115
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,169
we trust to get access to regular fasho

116
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,889
breaking out of this I shall but it
didn't work out

117
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,610
so we moved up

118
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,860
and there is of course it PFS which is

119
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,360
the most common interface use its very
user friendly interface

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,050
and it's a lot to serve also are things
you can set up your DSL

121
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,290
connection you can change your local
networking

122
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,169
settings you can a change or why I said
thanks because are also ask why I

123
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,570
villages and also as functionality

124
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,070
so you can set up your said server in
this its first

125
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,680
and it also allows few some basic
statistics

126
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,930
suggests a bet what's that statistics

127
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,949
and the last thing that is provided bus
interface

128
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,769
are diagnostic functionalities

129
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,440
so visited you can see 3

130
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,580
different functions here a thing
portrait of russia

131
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,120
a the SLI test generate test

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,670
was basically allows to test your
Internet and the subjectivity

133
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,890
and the first day well

134
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,470
other very strange was that this %uh for

135
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,310
of the ping utility when you throw
something at trial think a

136
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,240
and will show the results in a text area
and it looks very familiar to us today

137
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,390
Linux think tomorrow so i thought okay

138
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,920
his hair let's try it content section
air

139
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,220
after a seven car another ask not a
semicolon to see what happens

140
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,430
follow-up

141
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,250
plzz it was easy at you might notice

142
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,730
a the of I shows that web servers
running through

143
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,730
so we can actually up do everything we
want

144
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,870
with this

145
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,010
okay so what we have we have are
trademarks two shots

146
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,440
him but is not filled in anywhere so
there are no

147
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,320
a characters that are streets are
anything like that

148
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,520
there is one restriction up you can only
extra to

149
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,420
36 characters but OK 36 characters

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,529
squad also stuff really either

151
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,160
a restriction and become one

152
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,029
as we just saw Francis Ruth and we can

153
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,270
if okay controversial music this

154
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,970
going injection

155
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,140
so whatever do we create an explosive I
believe it

156
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,480
better so this best

157
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,970
do school to up that's good testifies

158
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,240
up advice session

159
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,490
and they will return to its computer
sewing kit

160
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,290

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,820
class first one to see you have Ruth

181
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,730
a sec but you can see that is running a
very nice part of

182
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,120
first 2.6 plenty of fun actually

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,360
so Am I if be able to relax furnace

184
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
for this kind of but event

185
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,649
kasparov for

186
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,670
at a loss how about you can see this %uh

187
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,670
device based on IMS architecture

188
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,550
good demonstrate this because an example
school bus

189
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:44,550
we have set up there so we can actually
that's right this low for a bit

190
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,180
its

191
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,180
so as you can see week here's our little
their officials group

192
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,740
to OS like this

193
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,880
to execute a call the system I could
following picture I took

194
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,800
shirk good

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,710
good so

196
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,160
this cool we can use our script to
execute come on Sahara

197
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,100
fucked up but our we want to get
something more persistent so

198
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,230
for example we want to just essential to
our

199
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,400
act as a regular Bishop so it's okay to
only

200
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,640
essential to our she would get this I
show so how does this action over

201
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,200
by doing a rebel official so

202
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,200
we open up the impossibility far up and
we saw that it was actually using

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,140
that use was actually using a regular
essential so

204
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,000
why is there such a another sideshow I'm
internet

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,040
it turned out the into a hopeful that
there's

206
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,450
profiles of and it is the profile

207
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,360
there is an excuse Qamar which executes
these I show up

208
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,340
so soon as we look in this context you
to every restricted to decipher

209
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,950
okay so we thought okay

210
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,550
%uh change this behavior animated

211
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:24,350
up open a regular officials said this I
shall suffer things are okay

212
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,060
that's removed his bro HOF but it turned
out that

213
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,110
that's left for is a

214
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,950
modest read-only so we were unable to
remove any Facebook

215
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,380
but luckily this let's see

216
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,390
directory Israel so we change the past
so we def up

217
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,690
at Winchester all four of the other user
2.2 to slash to the root of the fastest

218
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,010
myself to slash all set so that s where
you located

219
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,170
it won't execute a provocative is not
there

220
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,380
and only about occur

221
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,980
and then we a we connect using the admin
user so in

222
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,220
we don't have through text chat and
wynona

223
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,630
past for reader so we cannot use you
sOooo

224
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,350
and get through but there's an easy fix
though

225
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,610
just replace the as the root user in the
shadows of

226
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,610
for and replaced with a behalf

227
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,370
for which we note passport office and we
can you sue to get through this

228
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,440
and wi-fi access okay

229
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,670
so let's wrap this up %uh this is a low

230
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,280
ability Sony the fiscal sooo

231
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,060
that are and you also need protections
for to

232
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,870
up for tomorrow sorry yeah it's be able
to locate

233
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,120
then you can use this for a minute but
eventually

234
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,550
a if you have all these things you can
get service

235
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,900
preferred good as a local

236
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,520
busy so phat a remarkable abilities

237
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,780
wat will ur so let's start frame-up
management /url

238
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,110
local or remote management for a bit
I'll I species are tired of dealing with

239
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,900
the support

240
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,130
so what a long as a way to remotely a
physical preparations ok result vices

241
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,300
even important for us to so in a way of
doing it right

242
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,610
so this was so unexpected result 40
invented the

243
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,960
you are 0-6 Dyster where's is a

244
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,830
protocol which when missus flexibility
adult 2006 nice to influence this

245
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,300
WMP protocol which stands for CPU

246
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,800
law management protocol as basically use
by

247
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,070
ISP's when sixties to look for new
overtures external auditory

248
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,270
profession is a or for updates

249
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,370
so often we noticed in the X

250
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,980
commencement in the face when we wanted
to forty fourth

251
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,800
is that it said it is 4 7-6 7-6

252
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,980
is reserved for dirty or $0.06 night
connection request

253
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,010
port so this is a also oil we respond
I'll

254
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,810
to your 06 not exist at all so we had
some

255
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,600
dig deeper into this what is this so to
say that we were

256
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,170
protocol again CPU long management
protocol

257
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,330
others for a fish corporation
deployments

258
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,580
%uh basically with the silly with the
protocol with two entities

259
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,630
one is the city the customer premise
equipment

260
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,020
which basically is that these all other
followers Rs

261
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,710
and you know once the ACS or to
alterations or

262
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,340
which is a even for a service running on
the side of the ISP

263
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,610
sold BCS bowl initiated connections with
a CD

264
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,930
a ksl and I'll be able to

265
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,630
professional settings for all us for
this well

266
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,250
things are going interest right want to
be cool if you could put a role for

267
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,440
wrote this to all his fault

268
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,490
because my also those XP 4 7-6 7-6

269
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,530
not loss by fire also

270
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,520
exhaust as up connects with over to
watch face

271
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,880
and law so I species including a big
which one

272
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,150
%uh file or anything their side in order
to prevent you from your

273
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,740
connecting to export from any arbitrary
host so let's have a look at

274
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,140
2006 nice sax solos there's the

275
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,560
steven is a legal dispute 4 7-6 7-6

276
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,490
like the massive okay with no sex we do
list

277
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,510
the connection to a sport is the the
response

278
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,160
or reply with the server which says
Sykes overall base your version 4.3 for

279
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,380
more on this later so as soon as
accessible from any longer next host

280
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,520
both to do with anything interesting we

281
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,610
require St I just the patient

282
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,840
which is unique to every 5s

283
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,800
so whereas we're into their own loaded
with extras information but we don't

284
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,980
have it for

285
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,830

by a 2006 not

315
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,850
at contest your %uh status yes

316
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,050
which is used but demand to

317
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:18,950
connect better days yet and there is
also a username and password in here

318
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,430
a which are unique for everybody ISO

319
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,690
I i cant use these credentials for any
other hot

320
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,060
and these credentials are used for you
based be digest authentication so as

321
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,560
soon as the ACS will initiate a request
connection to the modem

322
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,080
the tomorrow I will use these
credentials to verify identification

323
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,090
request

324
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,070
and there are fewer properties in a row
but they're not really interested

325
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,630
interesting

326
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,850
occur let's talk about euros the

327
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,190
this the man is using we use the Street
utility

328
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,340
to get this your other by relief and the
first one

329
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,500
but thought one has less WFP's less
connection request

330
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,440
this issue right issues but a cs2
initiate re-question

331
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,940
a request to set up a session at

332
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,320
and day if you are you russ and they all
start let's let you be

333
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,950
and you might be wondering okay what's
you eat with us

334
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:26,370
do we stand for well it turns out to be
a stance for user exit

335
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,810
and when we a know there are answers to
one of these Europe

336
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,220
a show some basic forms

337
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,410
and one of the force is displayed on the
left that's less Ruiz left for display

338
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,100
and it's just basic for which class to
actor

339
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,230
tasked with textplus and express the
submit button

340
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,480
button to submit for we will submit its
whose

341
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,470
lets you use less process for am what
will happen is

342
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,190
process form will display a text you
after

343
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,510
and you could do some basic excess over

344
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,160
Cesar for film up

345
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,700
verse or exploits with this but it's not
really it's just a

346
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,390
by up we trust politics and

347
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,200
when we had a very last spring to this
text books more than 50 characters

348
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,230
Turner the man crashed so I thought K

349
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,690
what's this trying to reconnect but
because connect anymore

350
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,230
so we could affect impressed demands on
us

351
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,330
and then I'll service so this means that

352
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,820
Internet Service Provider would not be
able to

353
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,000
remotely management managed justifying
or

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,080
so once you agree with you more

355
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,990
everything will start yes work together

356
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,200
but yes we do everything in stock you
cannot

357
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,470
up at yet manager are anymore

358
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,370
so okay we should now hospice up by S

359
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:08,370
democratic and we might be able to get
arbitrary code execution

360
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:14,030
soloists are first politics are my
favorites record is set for Oct pro

361
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,590
I'll we've missed a call when you buy a
result in low

362
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,710
and low it's workable approach of a
unlikely there's lots of symbols

363
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,280
side of the body so is quite two
isolates the routines that are

364
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,520
responsible for his crash

365
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,940
%uh so it was leaving or what because
we're still at work

366
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,770
lives as well was a little road block
away but the first few minutes doing

367
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,220
that

368
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,669
by to a whole thing going to use that
our lives for a build

369
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:45,860
so let's have a look at the for
durability there's for single

370
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,470
Google+ for which is responsible for
handling all

371
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,890
also requests sets is this for

372
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,120
this function will he follow our good
for item

373
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,550
where r justice for all better but less
so this is a routine

374
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,490
the broader like within this nation

375
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,460
offer on the stack which specific size
48 bus

376
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,610
I guess you care guess where this goes
so

377
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:16,480
or go for a ride to a lot of balls check
it and what chemicals

378
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,570
know what his boss again they must live
or whatever so it will just go against

379
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,040
us are going until races as a robot

380
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,100
know what animal style %uh calls

381
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,429
size of the original decision or

382
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,660
so we're dealing with classics growth

383
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,810
for the ones we all owe because they
were

384
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,070
up early predicted a realistic to

385
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,080
awesome place to explore

386
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,700
whatsoever always first a a major is a
%uh there's

387
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,140
library I opening goal hero

388
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:59,190
I'll so electro sooo conditional
operator is a bit harder for

389
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,679
suffice for manual yeah all is
acceptable see it

390
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,840
wish %uh demonstrators also made plans
to a certain actions using your official

391
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,890
ever

392
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,340
so it was trading opportunities strobel

393
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,280
a or less excessive for a military fall
earlier is

394
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,020
other strata segal right here so let's
all

395
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,640
are always Clara old 25 characters

396
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,020
and grab it all day good for us for sure

397
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,169
%uh using it is a stick of presidential
over

398
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:38,280
as is our biggest far-right gloss J

399
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,740
%uh and operating all large stuck

400
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,740
so good I'll let's talk tomorrow

401
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,419
first a short while song two years ago I
i think is all assholes

402
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:55,640
a mess to forced to entire address

403
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,890
up you might wanna rock to is is not
only with skull

404
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:06,890
style basically compromise over 400,000
fleiss's using potentials

405
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,010
solo or with a memory corruption here
people are just walking into the fight

406
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,150
is using all in all

407
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,330
our room truth it's still possible even
it was awesome as well

408
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,919
so because all of those buses and bus
leaving all small

409
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,770
outfits using this policy news for you
follow through bluetooth

410
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,490
namely through what's good tiredness
this far-right

411
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,440
so you have this little over excuses
though

412
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,610
he also has a very detailed statistics
%uh for example

413
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,730
it's with most used the sulfur

414
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,650
various protocols so for example with
official

415
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,800
XP pair yeah

416
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,270
herds of goats for surprisingly fun to a
question you still have this

417
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,770
the most regressive the service other
but

418
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,450
to my surprise also it's part of our
genetics or II this last edited or

419
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,200
whatever

420
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,340
know if i Allegro or on Twitter which is
currently very widespread

421
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,250
as overall there 231 million devices

422
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,590
over Texas directly accessible from the
internet

423
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:19,400
yeah it's only awarded a salt along
dole's really 7676 work so

424
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,800
are not part of this chart so there's a
low

425
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,830
there are no making up for over

426
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,570
in December says of all public its to
surfers

427
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,610
I think that's a law

428
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,580
occur so let's talk about billion
minutes to chat

429
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,140
as mentioned before we did some static
analysis on the body

430
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,540
using I'm pro but now I want to do
something I can us

431
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,820
so we needed for to do that

432
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,590
at as the fuss based on IMS architecture

433
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:58,960
we have two compile version of GDP 14s
Architektur

434
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,820
and we could do that by to see binutils

435
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,570
lissy from scratch into a home and a but
there is a

436
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,070
for a solution a

437
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,710
issues bill truth so with lol truth

438
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:19,960
and think about it and You Can Dance
roommate menu complicated

439
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,260
I'm not mad you will show up and it will
I have to select all

440
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,390
different things for sure to select your
after

441
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,679
in our case pitch and then you can
select the utilities you would like to

442
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,730
Costco up an arc as we selected GDP

443
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,000
and I'll try it stress and a few other

444
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,530
to this and that's just a matter of

445
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,950
running make install app go through bill
Paul S

446
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:53,010
until it is for you so into an

447
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,220
that we've just had to go overseas by
restoring us

448
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,770
up and could use GB

449
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,270
so we're an hour see eye to eye Dr 06 my

450
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,450
sieg she gets here and we

451
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,639
up fill in a test for

452
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,379
as for shopping for with a 50 characters

453
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:21,000
and crest out see what's really going on

454
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,490
as you can see here up the pro

455
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,600
concert is over is owned by rivers

456
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,620
and as you might notice there are also
if you are a registered nurse

457
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,320
there are entire for which file come in
handy

458
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,510
lead so that's right back spot

459
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,530
so let's all try to exploit quickly
sought to minimize

460
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,460
find the exact position all where we
were corrupt fix

461
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,750
helped control fix so if I know if we
said

462
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,520
40 hrs follow for us as for what

463
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,600
control both PC the program cultural mix

464
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,070
up so where to go from here mean we
could put a show called and save overall

465
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,720
stack

466
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,030
and then choked to death %uh but there's
a little problem years

467
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:14,800
it's fortunate that this is a growth so
I trust job so it's always okay currency

468
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,340
seculow actually be able to execute
instructions

469
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,370
parents with a single step so

470
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,540
we sum is greater awareness programming
%uh

471
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,659
but also there's at still be able to
join us for a little step

472
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,080
using this eventually we should be able
to run around both

473
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,320
show growth and going straight to every
most good show

474
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,370
from the world's so let's talk a bit
about

475
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,950
role miss up we're not gonna go over all
the risks of return or

476
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,010
program years results are up for Best

477
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,610
up wrong this is a bit of course

478
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,080
if you use the euro x86 you know to
calls to action

479
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,220
with Richard Harrison stacked so
naturally the sovereignty will

480
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,550
with the restriction school richard is a
second job to

481
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,250
however on this there's a that is return
it was

482
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,399
Irish there or just call our say so

483
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:15,720
whenever day was also pretty day it was
the killer instruction

484
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,720
which means job handling which will or
register with a up

485
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,230
to fill or register with a reduce
friction

486
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,520
other jobs already so some pretty good
job for us to a structure to re-register

487
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,889
which will render so xxx we gonna I just
slightly terrorists and just next to

488
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:40,830
them in water

489
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:46,370
bonus we need to be more careful insults
are going to feel or register yourself

490
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,230
are a lot of good as the are super-g

491
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,220
somewhere in the middle up

492
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,970
so there still is a lot closer to us
protesters in India Asia's

493
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,210
I'll listen to resist for sale switch

494
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,929
%uh basically a forceful text which is
by invoking

495
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:10,500
so do you think sometimes to get OS
doesn't look all that switch for example

496
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,590
sleeve

497
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,280
so we will be returning to sleeve when
large amounts of water with the second

498
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,080
delay

499
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,340
a so does not synchronize to our orders
actually physical force you

500
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,169
could be executed I'll latest data on
this the five assists

501
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:31,210
excludable so is already very minimal
role today

502
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,760
to love it when it comes to go over and
see if us going to a show called

503
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,950
eventually pressure there's no other
space randomization

504
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,450
either or so next is going to choose
even though it's

505
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,700
still hostile if I S to a concert you
watched Dexter we don't really know yet

506
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,800
it's always been a challenge up

507
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,610
one for the lost thing to know is that
I'll miss whenever I Preciosa

508
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,970
the destruction of her graciousness
always executed before

509
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,500
French so I regardless all registered or
not

510
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,610
his version of it will always be excuses
first

511
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,520
something to do with bipod

512
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,639
so let's talk baseball its we use their

513
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,320
how creative we got I mean there's
Millsboro success and this is probably

514
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,870
other users or clears way it works for
us

515
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:30,620
as moves new ways so got will also the
80 S through it what which the

516
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,960
for sleeve I'll Eagles bill

517
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,830
tonight sweet pickles and so as a lot of
a

518
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,850
during the peace credence left earlier
you

519
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,980
notes that we control the weather Morris
this is well included as well

520
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,050
so Phil as along with a result good

521
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,129
to I'll so on August

522
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:56,139
to is being executed well this is a bit
above the special guest

523
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,570
because it's as good as it will show
tonight

524
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,380
which storm is filled with as well so
the store to get

525
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,470
who has one still those rates its own
interest

526
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:11,670
to so that's really what's closer as
good as it will be focused to a good

527
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,120
but the bill is going to call ok
struction Swiss

528
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,810
low various villains from the steps I'll
switch oras to

529
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,490
s1 s0 so week 2006 will also

530
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,250
for sandra is good as one will be filled
with adversely

531
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,120
which we get almost there and that
executes

532
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,630
good to get this time just want to ask
their sleeve

533
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,790
so I it's alright I guess 3s of this
gadget will actually executes leave

534
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,920
and I'll text Gonzaga and a good up
through the second time this

535
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,160
a good running also love the officials
there

536
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,280
including to 11 to re-register

537
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,240
so wesley is gone roaring to its
function so we fill it with others

538
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,490
get it free

539
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,640
guests freeloaders more playful stare
I'll just be yourself re-register

540
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,160
to their schedules for as one to go to
there is a good just five

541
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,560
and the residual obstruction which will
just two are okay

542
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,550
so we Norwich guests for a just for me

543
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,590
foods as well 29 so 2900

544
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,090
says they're so good at five and we just
got to fuck both

545
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,180
for just got five such previously

546
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,930
any destruction also a branch what we've
experienced first

547
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:39,119
so lost for children ages 4 isn't asked
the jurors are

548
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,869
structure which fulfill everyone
register with valuable

549
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:46,850
sp incremented by 10 84

550
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:52,960
so I decided to write a good life people
despite what they want 29

551
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,730
oh yeah points are unsettled approach
the quarter

552
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,140
where we can put our show to exposition
so this is nice we don't suggest it

553
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,590
results that

554
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,580
oh and do it all using role so
effectually

555
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,970
reach the job destruction good life

556
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:16,280
yeah this will actually execute our
showgirl successfully

557
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,760
I guess it's a %uh softball show

558
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,310
let's see if this works Devils love you
know our size

559
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,530
work

560
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,280
because so now we connect to for this
blows over here

561
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,710
which is connected to the 140 not out so
it's

562
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,740
a be able to connect to remote sites
and/or

563
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,190
its

564
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:51,190
and will start a listener

565
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:58,540
broader exploited by over

566
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,550
and on 154 service

567
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,550
6 yes

568
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,970
so I really hope this will work classic
while

569
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,650
because we're going to sort of circular
isn't there

570
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,210
%uh they were the first for so there we
go we

571
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,599
just I'll to shell from the wall so I
was there might be a bit fuzzy

572
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,319
to you this we're using all one a nine
to 16

573
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,749
said go whatever process well that's
because we're gonna get another set up

574
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:37,700
here so we're actually going through
Walmart right now

575
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,819
which is the Internet's book worst just
fine

576
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:45,390
using up these lol as well 6x users are
throwing their

577
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,489
so I successfully up

578
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,900
well calls or emails show device a

579
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,309
theoretically we could do it is of any
bias

580
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:00,809
the yes for so 606 openly admits so

581
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:05,279
quickly sees UFO it's actually omits the
fuss

582
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:12,279
yeah other of that's it

583
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,230
a good so you can imagine

584
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,320
this is a very a serious vulnerability

585
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,010
up because 4 7-6 7-6

586
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,070
can be reached from any IP address
fireball

587
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,250
and so it is OK we should do something
with this

588
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,400
up maybe we should conflicts I saw which

589
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,430
created the spot a but it's an Asian
company

590
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,380
now we're not paying them so we're not
sure if

591
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,730
that was gonna work out so behaviors

592
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,430
better to not are it's not service
provider

593
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:01,430
up so that's what we did week of Dec to
answer T

594
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,770
good get his or her alone time for our

595
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,460
%uh we went there for a while meeting
I'll to discuss with you

596
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,520
Scopus for her abilities a I'll always
exploit them out

597
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,660
possibly misguided of course there were

598
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,590
quite show fast by any chance is there
anyone of

599
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,490
okay the room right up ICOS over

600
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:34,490
Costco auto sales describes a girl

601
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,640
can write

602
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:46,640
you it's a it's a pleasure

603
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,600
just like you be sure it's

604
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,160

thank you this thank you thanks I
disclosure tax

608
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,200
yes although us so as you can see her
body is very

609
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,620
customers are having a beer at a really
good x2 people are safe

610
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,060
viewed as having everybody's happy so
much happiness rather

611
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,910
script so other more serious face

612
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,050
other schools in its religious or
spyware

613
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,270
forces all otto's are because how could
reduce

614
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,370
%uh

615
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:39,630
so first of all I start I'll to a
smiling lips

616
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,180
for miss because live yes very happy
when she wants goes wrong of course

617
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,030
first or well this no or whatever

618
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,090
so I started leveling a small utility

619
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,150
call virtual minor because

620

really simple overall flows are still
alive okay

788

security of the stuff plus

797
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,349
I'll if you want to restore XP peres

798
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,880
real story of course fuck as well

799
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,420
because we're in our internet isn't
working for the first

800
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:46,420
is a yep

801
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,920
we've got a question over there Solheim

802
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,420
up so maybe it's more a question for you
people would

803
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,540
you see what you do when you have you
soon you will do it means to reduce it

804
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,400
would

805
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,010
sick you need you to get sick kids and
an

806
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,650
basically point it wouldn't bring you
into this includes sumo

807
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,920
is unknown which would be to use to know

808
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,320
of you with the evil which means
something to me

809
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,020
also wrote not sure about so I got a
question

810
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,910
they were saying close calls with good
stuff for realsies

811
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,150
so basically said yes and moves to use a

812
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:30,090
each individual cities miss you to be in
a speech worked

813
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:34,940
each do you want to you need is a minute
musicians a

814
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,250
different you two sixes do same time

815
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,620
so you could have yet to see a treat for
your internet line

816
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,850

moved in with me

817
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:49,530
me TV's did not mention from the
internet

818
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:54,540
Russell Russ you right those first
though it's also assume its good it is

819
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,370
up although the last piece I'd also love
sucking and locals would like to also

820
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:06,380
what is on offer to a specialist but I'm
sure it

821
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,570
to soften some really good as the ISP
side as well which is more or less with

822
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,310
a Rizk

823
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,930
its throughout its good as issue
successfully

824
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:20,230
yeah please know that we focused on
consumer is selling fast so

825
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:23,960
this device are other today rose stall
at

826
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,630
nothing's gonna to over a review lost
touch

827
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,060
just plug-and-play corporate said

828
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,550
me any other questions

829
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:39,960
so

830
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,370
assuming someone has the right system do
you have any other ideas

831
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:49,160
home in other sorry was

832
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,890
do you have any %uh the the is a bus
from these two methods

833
00:56:53,890 --> 00:57:00,160
how kid from the remote site you mean
him

834
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,960
there are possible arthritis which

835
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,590
used to gain access for the whole site

836
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,860
for a remote server there should be a
service

837
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,730
available from three months up to solder

838
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,540
sooo text service that you need in order
to protect the last bus

839
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,720
we go along with this piece 0676

840
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,290
a a slave to the overall also I have

841
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:31,790
that more or less pure farce a-listers
like a really low level loss and speedy

842
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,710
implementation or whatever running in
the box with their lives

843
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:41,650
so it's pretty solid SS the cooperation
issues into its bylaws absolving

844
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:45,340
up if there's no accessible services
from the house so I have

845
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,770
it's gonna be a lot of breaking into a
vault

846
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:52,280
well of course we can discuss their
lower lid

847
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,810
I don't think do love assessments are

848
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:00,050
so it goes the low risk assessment to to
execute across

849
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,190
quest for printer so we can go to your
support so I H

850
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:08,930
where a minute after all in order to
hold your family so we can

851
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,860
to so that there are always those were

852
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,720
usually have to also service only in the
inside of

853
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,190
correctly is of course best for us

854
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:25,540
