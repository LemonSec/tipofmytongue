1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,380
well

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:15,380
yeah I'll

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,750
yes

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,769
thanks a lot I'm okay so as he's quite
the buzz words these days

5
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:32,519
I actually eats getting a to every
interesting direction for us hikers

6
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,730
because it's going to ob more accessible
hacking

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,079
up these the main it's been too long
telecom has been secluded

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,510
into a an area where to get your hands

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,079
on actual telecom equipment it was
cuisine impossible

10
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,260
except if you wanted to go for the black
side so

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,379
a for something to talk a little bit
about this Lt

12
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:58,399
unit for confinement now of course when
you talk about

13
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,179
telecom you talk about big Iran's
machine

14
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,619
each machine is actually always a
cluster always in high availability

15
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:07,320
setup

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,729
always carrying arounds hundreds of
thousands of people to

17
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,179
one to two million subscriber

18
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:19,590
for example right now somewhat I've
switch same if he's in it

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,720
and missus and enemies which basically
know where you are

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,399
and I get your communication to you
manage a $2.2 million people

21
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,829
so of course when you toss one kind of
equipment like that

22
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:34,299
it's quite a lot of people that your
actually targeting

23
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,570
what's interesting is now synth also
buzz words have come in

24
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,869
the domain such as for example
utilization and cloud

25
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,340
I'll companies like HP for example

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,520
or are working aggressively to enable
you to run

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,659
all these infrastructure in the cloud so
we are not that far from a crazy time

28
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,630
when you'd say

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,020
all I in from she ate my new 5g

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,600
operator on Amazon ec2 okay

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,740
its far-fetched but they want to get
there and what the benefit for us

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,280
is that everything that you see here
we're starting to be able to replicate

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,940
that

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,400
into simple via toolbox so what that
means is that you can do deep

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
instrumentation

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,239
you can actually try to find the night
beatty's we seen

37
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,489
some was a most critical code that
exists we think these networks

38
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,940
I'm here what we're going to focus

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,410
is um median on how to hack into

40
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,760
to of the network element which really
interest us

41
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,290
which or the même which is equivalent
of the MSC

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,430
soma soma buy switch a in a

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,959
in forty years Lt networks and also into
HSS

44
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,120
which is the successor of as a HR

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,549
so first one thing that we have is that

46
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,449
and this is blah blah I'm this is going
to help

47
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,280
attackers and one thing a move more
store

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,549
of all rules is a factors is

49
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:10,720
actually something underrated as a
security mechanism

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,489
2-for-6 treatment and he's in protecting
the internet right now in my opinion is

51
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:14,989
not

52
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,949
and get everywhere the everyone agrees
to say that it's not the security

53
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:19,540
mechanism

54
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,880
well for the worse not better a

55
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,970
what happens with a LT is that they're
really deploying and ipv6

56
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,620
in these networks so that means that not
protection is that

57
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,239
now you have my key back and as we've
seen this morning in a presentation

58
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,449
it's getting for example the SRF a is
getting

59
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,479
very easy to actually practically use

60
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,600
ipv6 in order to hack into the network
so

61
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,040
now from house I cannot actually a
relieved 22 application also has been

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,060
doing for ten years

63
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm the change that happen

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,840
is that many network element got
actually merged

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,060
into simple box that no all

66
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,519
run Linux so it's not a matter of a

67
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,680
okay what kind of operating system does
it run on you take

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,250
Ericsson you take NSN you take while way
you take that he

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,310
you take maybe even alcatel-lucent's is
a French I'm not

70
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,750
that like me anymore the incredible I'm

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,100
these are running Linux in the past
these were only running

72
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,110
Monali Teague PDX works with monolithic
development crazy

73
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,110
amount of update are running on the FPGA
Sui specific hardware

74
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,110
one things that they did is that the I
the vendors

75
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,560
and you're free to standardized as a
hardware

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,400
in order to run the same hardware
everywhere of course in h2

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,080
to screw it up and to actually make it
uncomfortable but that means

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,360
that its X eighty-sixth its linux-based

79
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,909
and you can actually quite easy dump
what's on it

80
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,129
I'll what's interesting is that the you
know that he's now

81
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,689
look very much like femtocell so if you
happen to them to sell

82
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,960
basic results really going to look very
much

83
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,270
like what you're going to do we should I
can't we know these

84
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,419
I'm also what's interesting is that very
often

85
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,469
so love season big Iran's specifically
the ones that are doing a lot of data

86
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,240
processing

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,960
neck signal processing are going
straight to you some hardware

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,629
futures which are hardware boards and
all love them

89
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,810
will be actually running some FPGA
cluster

90
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,060
so I'll month some some person

91
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,590
was a demonstrating to me what we had
hacked into

92
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,539
losing to the data center and grabs a
like a sub rack

93
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,979
and plug it out while it was blinking
and I'm going like

94
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:46,710
yooo guy is this is a be dangerous to
the CWA tuned for eats

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,530
Oct what everywhere so easy stuff is
actually what we are hiking 0

96
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,590
the only stuff we're not going to be
able to get allies yet

97
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,319
and what we didn't managed to to
instrument PDP

98
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,580
is actually the FPGA kud which we only
have bitstream for

99
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,039
inside these specific the TKT plates

100
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,669
was always the rest it's quite something
which can be a

101
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,120
opened in the 60s who normal normal to
keep

102
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,650
didn't so what's interesting is that Lt
actually

103
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,889
brought into cuzzz the

104
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,129
he's too mean new protocols but reuse
your old ones

105
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,779
to alza different network elements that
we've seen

106
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,080
whether what's this specification and
the industry try to do

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,509
is to merge them in order to have

108
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,779
a single set of protocols and

109
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,930
what happens is that they wanted to go
for food I P o'neill Weezy's new

110
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,699
protocols which are mainly

111
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,779
x1 and x2 AP and diameter

112
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,400
and of Kools knows a mighty see that
he's there to replace

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,349
all the all telecom technology

114
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,180
well actually what happens easy exactly
opposite

115
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,400
is that you don't find the right now a
single operator in the world

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,789
which has Lt who doesn't have the same
time

117
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,099
before set that of his all the gifts he

118
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,430
ss7 sic transit at so that means that

119
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,439
use Ted of reducing technology we just
moved by the

120
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,240
multiplied it by two seem to love direct
attacks are face

121
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,370
that means that you're not now
protecting only GDP

122
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,210
you're predicting GDP plus s1 EP Press
next week

123
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,319
you're not protecting any more sick
training this is seven

124
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,999
you have to protect diameter on top of
that and all of these

125
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,259
have to be understood as the legal
tunneling protocols which

126
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,270
are going to be able to channel data
between the different component

127
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,889
of a real operator and this is not a
real operator

128
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,379
what's missing here 2g

129
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:54,279
of course if you have an operator's at
only doing 3G or 4G

130
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,849
well sooner or later is going to be
acquired by the one who are really

131
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,669
having should be customers based

132
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,789
to the people who don't have it are
doomed so the all want to be compatible

133
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,809
with a legacy

134
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:09,139
what's happening is that too support
this legacy a

135
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,270
the telco have deployed 11 things that
is quite efficient which is called

136
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,789
cs4 back so you're happy with your new a
fab let

137
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,849
surfing on Facebook as you all do I'm
sure

138
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,870
in the I'm yours in having a call

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,930
or you want to make a call and what's
happening is that

140
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,059
you are going most of the time

141
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:34,589
to switch back to the 3G or 2g network
it's called

142
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,370
CS fallback secrets which fall back and
when you do that

143
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,930
actually about was the committee from
the past are present again

144
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,190
and most of the time it's he's urged you
to some

145
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,740
media gateways or to some MSG proxy
which are

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,600
actually going to proxy everything's
that's coming from this 27 side

147
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,760
back into the a if he sighed

148
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,730
so Ltd sometimes a call at work you know
hear about

149
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,250
it called EPC Evolved Packet core or

150
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,660
if a Eve salvi's architecture evolution
its

151
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,720
look at to what you have is

152
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,810
some operators are advance so they say
okay we don't want

153
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,060
CS fallback and the goal for what is
called voice-over Lt

154
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,450
which is actually your just Voice over
IP with

155
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,060
a specific 8 p.m. to connect to zzzz
quality of service guaranteed

156
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,690
and it worked so what happens is that
you have

157
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,410
of course some new servers so it's a new
attacks her face

158
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,560
and since it's you maturity of its is
not approved

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,040
proven now also I'm you have

160
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,900
um you AP and in general which give
access to a wall said

161
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,750
new set of networks each time use your
new ATM

162
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,480
you see the sea determined that you
enter when you have a new

163
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,840
cell phone sometime well the stuff give

164
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,970
access to let's say the wall slash

165
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,990
8 behind it all the times because

166
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,400
all the time you have teeth tend not
something

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,680
network last that host all the network
element from the IT network

168
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,720
and of course you have hundreds of 192
168

169
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,150
Harris 1918 that works which also host

170
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,680
some did Katie don't specific networks
so what you have

171
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,890
is actually an overlap up of a lot

172
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,930
have different networks and that's what
you how are suposed

173
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,630
to actually qualify horizontally by
scanning these

174
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,220
and also vertically and what happens is
that things the

175
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,050
on these vertical stack the pied that
stuff that we know

176
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,410
no we know even much better how to get

177
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,280
into is used because this is actually
just on the optical

178
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,010
and insipid we're going to encapsulate
something formation

179
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,560
which is actually direct sa7 it's called
Isaac injection

180
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,730
so what we see is that we exploded

181
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,980
the number of 8 p.m. and slash eight we
need to scare him

182
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,370
and week dude also an explosion
complexity income

183
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,860
of actual protocols that you can to know

184
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,880
one into each other then half of them

185
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,440
out to continue his new code base that
probably was not

186
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,870
as checked have the old cosby could
based

187
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,660
so what happened here is that you're
going to be

188
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,290
if you live along oz from network
operator

189
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,770
to all the sa7 attacks so heated a few
here

190
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,240
we knows about SSP your SSP year

191
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,450
base the mississippi does

192
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,170
point could previous %um global title
for the previous you

193
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,280
okay that stuff is going to die with I
will need was there all day nosers

194
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,040
a of the love this domain and basically
is a new guys coming

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,360
into the network want to do assessment
of the security

196
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,870
but it could easily go over that and say
yeah with this technology is going to

197
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,330
die

198
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,610
this is a legacy sandwich we're not
going to deal with it

199
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,000
soon and SATs wrong as the seventies
here to status for

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,110
good 10 15 20 years

201
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,890
what's interesting also is that a what
the big

202
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,940
vendors that typically every KSA

203
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,230
Nokia Siemens network alcatel-lucent
said

204
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,470
well gave this network is secure for two
reasons

205
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,510
1 it's proven to you only nice people
can get

206
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,220
into it where into it are we know these
people

207
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,570
let's hope that but what we see on the
net groupies amount of hacking is at

208
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,710
of calls are not only nice people and
you proven

209
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,030
no it's not proven what we find in the
last year and that

210
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,590
only the last year up we managed to
crash

211
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,680
Ericsson MSC wheeze mouth for
Mississippi traffic

212
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
that means that you could say yeah but
it's old system

213
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,510
no that's just too lead us or 14 the
release of the exxon the messy

214
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,840
and the simple reason is that we send
with an interfaith

215
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,220
which is warning to face that would not
be present anymore

216
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,300
its a bit like if you were combining
saying

217
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm sending GTP version 0

218
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,590
on support the TKT 42p version warm

219
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,750
so what happens is just basically
inversion

220
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,940
of protocol us into the wrong port

221
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,130
we triggers is back okay it's a

222
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,100
lack of luck it's not what's when singer
20 interesting

223
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,110
the phrases that these people are
starting to use

224
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,450
this thing all but we used insists we
use it said to qualify I were

225
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,880
a SECP stack or he doesn't go that deep

226
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
so we're going to talk about his in a
bit so all these days

227
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,420
and we now have to deal with wheeze all
these you know I decided to defuse that

228
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,180
was a

229
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,570
the one that i'd adjusted about in the
senate in g2/m

230
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm we have also some interesting thing
is that

231
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,610
we have one little after knowing we say
that which is sick turn

232
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,220
the morning as a 7-over AP we have then
some to knowing

233
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,220
of information about mobility that he's
done by map

234
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,050
and I forget about the routing and
encapsulation which is also think

235
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,450
summer tuition there now what's
interesting is that you can

236
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,180
also embed into this event some read
your signaling

237
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,450
think all by the way a job a station the
something something to your MSG

238
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,350
but bad neck this is coming from the
outside

239
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,940
from the international network so how
could that happen

240
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,130
is that we are not even mad sure
necessary in terms of use during

241
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,360
so it was a very interesting seeing here
is that its the perfect storm

242
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,230
for for it coming and what we've seen at
some operators

243
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,560
is that we were discussing with them and
this a

244
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm yeah how we win we're not sure about
the budgets you know

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,660
I'm this insecurity and I were problems
these days

246
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,370
is most Kiwis a H&R intimacy crashes

247
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,850
okay isn't the security so for them

248
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,880
this is budgets as they are selling that
giving to the vendors

249
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,800
who are already fading at providing day
versus your protection

250
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,640
easier in defense in depth protection
good facing increased security quick Q&A

251
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,910
have basically not in a good sense

252
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,410
what even more funny is that these guys
of you good at

253
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,980
really one thing is being development
programs so in the development program

254
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,870
the ritualized the code between the
analyze these tools a forensic tools

255
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,070
the actual enforcement tools a routine
tools so when we find the Burg

256
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,230
when we found the Burg about exxon STP

257
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,870
and Ericsson tried to reproduce these
bag

258
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,790
by reading our treaties that we
generated

259
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,610
using their tools out to crash too
because they were showing the same code

260
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,330
base

261
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,360
so that means that we the same Calif I V
90

262
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,020
you have both service i'd exploit in
plain sight expert

263
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,170
knock let's talk about something
thirties

264
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,280
you contact with us so wouldn't conflict
with this is actually these little

265
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,190
things called you would be easy which
are directly providing to us

266
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,510
as a radio signal so remembers this is
just

267
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,580
Linux systems running most of the time
Linux 2.6 boorda

268
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,930
16 and from with

269
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,360
some good good on it know what's
happening is that

270
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,840
the delivery smart stuff the a ring true

271
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,810
is introduced into the network some
people to be a concept

272
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,110
as good a dispute with the concept is
very interesting and very nice

273
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,460
when you roam from one you would be to
undertake no deep

274
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,280
what's happening is that the first he
would be channeling the leftover

275
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,380
of the traffic to you is the new we know
D

276
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,700
okay so they have to talk peer to peer
between

277
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,160
to roaming in ODIs what

278
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,209
it house as a consequence is up also he
knowed bees

279
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,069
often operator needs to talk with all
the rest you know these

280
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,880
so remember all howso old I'm

281
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,890
principle of 2g and 3G worked you had
RNC

282
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,159
which we as a radio network controller
or yes he's base station controller

283
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:24,189
for control only a small set

284
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,919
of legal base station from fevers okay

285
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,139
know what we have is a fully meshed

286
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:34,330
totally interconnected at layer 2

287
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,200
of calls it you know be's within an
operator

288
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,220
so what does that mean that means that
it suffice to

289
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,009
get you too one of the protocol

290
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:49,179
I want I'm sorry one of the you know
these

291
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:54,070
us who a these typical protocol which
have been proven to me I don't GDP

292
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,789
up at both ends I use a plane im on the
control plane

293
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:00,840
then you're going to be able to jump
from one

294
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,639
you would be to see other all to try to
access something else

295
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,809
on his beak able to network

296
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,440
so what's interesting here is that

297
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,490
of course adds a layer 2 zealous always
some guy

298
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,529
well-connected the wrong switch on the
wrong

299
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,529
was a switch its hallways happened

300
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:25,139
the only one person we didn't have that
in this room as a security problem

301
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:27,149
sweets carrier

302
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,399
one person I wouldn't say so we always

303
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,320
have done it beat me over of connected
the rules which

304
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
onto each easy unusually it doesn't
matter so much

305
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,120
what's interesting here is that the you
know do you

306
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,960
most of the time the need to be
provisions so use he's a guy with combs

307
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,110
into a new cell station iraq's

308
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,909
you would be and he has to make it or
the provision

309
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,039
well what's funny is that if your'e all
the stuff you certificates babies

310
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,370
authentication very nicely done and most
of the time when he's done production

311
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,429
it's actually the guy with a USB key

312
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,009
which is used be keen to the newbies
inconsiderate from here

313
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,679
so what we have is actually many

314
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,019
examples of being able schoos l2 network

315
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:20,059
to connect to use a what we call with S
operational systems support

316
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,669
which or actually the systems which are
going to do the provisioning of

317
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,299
all the newbies which are going to be
doing all the maintenance collecting

318
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,679
the traps on errors and the bug report
that they tried to drop

319
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,669
and what it looks like is actually just
exist is just like

320
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,080
big rack which in the past

321
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,570
the stuff used to be tedium network
interfaces

322
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,679
so does anyone as a TDM

323
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,759
card on his laptop now are you knees by
your head home

324
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:00,179
raise your hand I do nobody right nobody
cares about to give any more

325
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,549
and anyway because the time nobody hot
even these interconnection call

326
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,659
now what you see here is pure DWDM

327
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:12,899
the basically stole a lot and 50 sports
told of

328
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:16,190
a use on that board that everyone can
connect to

329
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,149
and what happens is that already seen
several 3G

330
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,019
started to happen but knowing if the
network some people are showing up disco

331
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:24,919
ball

332
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,860
open these very nice cabinet and just
blow to the network

333
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,580
l2e film that's down to the rest of alza

334
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,919
nude beaches and operational support
systems

335
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:41,369
so what's interesting also is that on
some vendors

336
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:45,039
what the deed is that they replaced a
the hardware

337
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,869
monitoring modules by IP hardware
monitoring modules

338
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,840
for physical intrusion so the principles
that you have a little loop

339
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,129
if you cut it there's no current wings
who's a loop so

340
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,700
alarm rings so he did something very
smart the tutsies

341
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,450
are I'm group and they say oh yeah
Ericsson version is a bit too expensive

342
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,110
we're going to replace it with our whole
and what they did

343
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,230
is that they did it was a magical super
fence

344
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,679
he clean up for hardware monitoring
probe

345
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,309
and the hardware monitoring probes as
one thing he does

346
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:23,149
if zulu if he's disconnected and no
current flows

347
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,759
then I send the packet 2000 SF saying

348
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,090
someone is intruding into the base
station

349
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,200
what the minority here kurds LG 45 cable

350
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,480
all the alarm system look back at my
alarm

351
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,789
so the war point of having this closed
loop with electricity

352
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:46,009
in order to actually take the stuff
which is quite costly when when you feel

353
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:46,779
heavy but he's

354
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:51,470
even bacchus he win the you you have no
service into an area

355
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,009
well what happens is that the made
totally wrong by

356
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,730
having a security system which doesn't
work we disclose group mentality

357
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,429
the brief in so we the stuff you can
connect here

358
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,960
to some no optical backbone and this
optical backbone

359
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,049
gives you access to actually Zoff and
from there

360
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,659
from the USS we are going to see what
kind of stuff we're going to talk with

361
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,909
also eat them of a affects our physics

362
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:24,019
my improvement you don't have only what
we've seen in terms of network

363
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,409
space but also in time of death of
protocol

364
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:31,240
I love these new protocol we told a
matter and as when the next you

365
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,080
who worked with the s diameter so far

366
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,389
yeah what okay three people

367
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,830
I'll and with x1 and x2

368
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,399
to people okay three people the same
market to

369
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,970
basically you the stuff is for diameter
just

370
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,369
a radius on theory X extensible radius

371
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,039
but there was some problem movies with
rage is it was the CD authentication

372
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,269
which we school was cool there is a
secret why bother

373
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,399
it should be provided by upper layer
everything should be on capsule eighty

374
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,730
into IP sec so they removed knows he's

375
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,139
read you secret which is not be more
present in in diameter

376
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:16,289
whole all useful and

377
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,860
now we have these as well XP x1 x2

378
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,749
AP's the which are basically
encapsulating protocols

379
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:27,110
so what it means is that we have new

380
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,389
capitulation with no even some traffic

381
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:35,429
which isn't completed which is dire keep
flowing from the UAE the user equipment

382
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,740
into the core network things to the EU
would be using

383
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,779
as for the next two and a diameter and
what that means

384
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,799
is that you have by Rick signalling with
no modification which is now flowing

385
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,429
from the X down all a user control
devices

386
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,619
directly into the con at work of course
it has to be humble and treated

387
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:59,259
no problem but the problem is that Weezy
F kind of exposure

388
00:23:59,259 --> 00:24:02,740
you know the kind of problem we are
going to be facing

389
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,639
also what's interesting is a diameter is
now also in the capsule 18 agent

390
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,919
and its look up still eating agent which
is Carino

391
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,029
so much interfaces that what you have

392
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,269
is really concentration and what he's

393
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,730
in the dog now I've diameter is out
there should be once on troll

394
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,879
router for diameter the diameter a
gentle diameter routing argento diameter

395
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,840
signaling router

396
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,840
and should carry everything and
everything that does not go on the meter

397
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,450
should go

398
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,210
in fifty well the problem is diameter

399
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,600
is that when you look at it and when you
look at the two

400
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,669
actual packet and at the specification
you read that

401
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:47,950
actual specification does not

402
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,749
a force you for anything nearly every

403
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:55,489
attribute value pair he's optional all

404
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:58,700
and if only deepen in one kind of
dialogue

405
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,649
you are to put this kind of attribute
you bet

406
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:08,429
so what happens is that when you have
this kind of protocol

407
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,470
its depending upon the dialogues if
rules the

408
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,009
business process going on with the user
with a subscriber

409
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:22,549
says geez ATP combinations that you need
to do which are specific to that

410
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:25,789
the VP values some love them miss be
fixed

411
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:29,669
in with you all these address space all
these problems space

412
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,999
you need to furs the content of diameter

413
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,460
the key that when you first most of the
time

414
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,029
you're just flowing some hot hair

415
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:43,059
onto your machine dizzy crash

416
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,220
does the crash no of course it does not
crash because you're not

417
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,779
actually triggering any basic block
which is processing your stuff

418
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:54,999
it's being blocked be four Sat baeza
decoding engine which is going to say

419
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:58,820
you competing competing compete they
don't process and what happens

420
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,100
is that if you don't have actually a
fizzer which can replicate

421
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,129
these diameter a flow not only related
to

422
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:11,659
for context so basically we are talking
about the fine it's the machines

423
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,379
you're not going to replicate anything
that's going to pressure network element

424
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:18,850
what happens is we went from zero
trigger

425
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,330
on only one thousand iteration okay
nobody

426
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,530
as 1,000 iteration a in the

427
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,040
him to climb inside the windows-based
the

428
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,000
fizzing forms we are talking of billions
a few generations

429
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,040
well in this case only we some

430
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,120
improvement into means a custom tools
and then improving

431
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,370
basically getting into real facing with
285

432
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,179
on one thousand 85 triggers on one
thousand two regional facing

433
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:54,809
and the scoring of statistics to talk to
the I do be on Microsoft guys

434
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,900
they would look at you are in or and the

435
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,620
say poor guy you really need some help
this is really bad metrics

436
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,299
and we are talking about what is cool
critical infrastructure

437
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,700
a equipment so what we can do is
actually

438
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,850
a phase a diameter is the famous xkcd

439
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,390
a I'm example that all we need a new
standard

440
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,210
and the create a standout follows a to
simplify the 14 or other competing at

441
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,210
just under

442
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,360
that can definitions and now you have
fifteen standards

443
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,799
the same thing we need to keep this is
seven we need to keep

444
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,190
all the seats and stuff like that and we
know when we know how

445
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,970
a new standard so let's get specific and
he

446
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,840
on the typical a healthy a equipment how

447
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,490
what what that means um we do with
Weiwei

448
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,630
which is a very popular are:

449
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,720
also provider challenging a week sons a
leadership position for telecom

450
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,350
equipment

451
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,040
and what the hive easy are totally going
to all these

452
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,440
at car kind of just a lazy Shin Min 20

453
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,160
the want to have still not ice x86 blade
to want to run things in just two lies

454
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,740
Asian

455
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,130
and what happen is that the started to
put all the phone component into

456
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,570
one or many books and now says even won
both the

457
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,800
HS something which is cool combining
bows

458
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,990
même the packets management

459
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,490
a systems such as the the p.m. gateway
in serving gateway

460
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,520
all into one box and what he's up books

461
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,280
is just Linux with if you fpga-based

462
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,910
a to specific hardware so

463
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,440
what is interesting is that if you
remind what we wear doing

464
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,370
we made from that you would be to get
access who

465
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,990
L to misconfiguration to SS and from
there

466
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,200
we were okay what can we do okay so

467
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,260
way we got into the USS was not very
nice I'm not very sexy

468
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,680
it was you too stupid misconfiguration
but it

469
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,480
it's quite the case in most of the Lt
operators the preteen

470
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,810
and then the question was how to get his
only grain

471
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,230
and actually go to all the H&R the

472
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,720
HSS Stena you know feat so

473
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,610
what's interesting is that all these
kind of systems are usually

474
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,910
big phat binary is which

475
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,390
or actually a developed monthly plus
plus most of the time

476
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,110
connected to database back-end and
wheeze

477
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,370
Java ok and the some FPGA

478
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,310
and basically connection port to that
the typical mix

479
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,290
and hearing this I D E I'm
representation

480
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,230
this something that food like bump into
your eyes and make you scream

481
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,600
is this something here really we open

482
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,890
for some stuff which is critical to see
it actually

483
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,700
maybe not does SQL

484
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
injection everywhere and if you see

485
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,170
everything boo is exported like publicly

486
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,800
this absolutely no sense a security so

487
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,850
when some people want to tell you
wielding security at he's the basics are

488
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,350
here

489
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,090
here it's not talking about the basics
maybe the basics

490
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,810
are considered to be up regarding the
use equipment

491
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,170
but we see that but you trigger of l2
hacking

492
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,980
he secured the fourth a misconfiguration
you get

493
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,450
20 inside love these equipment so what
we have

494
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,870
is very simple stuff which enable us to
cascade

495
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,600
into xoxo network from here we r

496
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,700
into the database of the H&R that's
considered game over

497
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,450
if we take that out with a simple drop
statement there's no indication any more

498
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,990
for was a subscriber of the operator
that you could tell me

499
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,700
well these are heavy replicated these
are cluster-based

500
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,980
systems that's right but that obeys

501
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,650
has to be unique the database even
clustered has to have a single

502
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,640
representation

503
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,870
you do the drop statement you're dead so

504
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,510
you'd say here that simple things that
we see everywhere

505
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,929
but the problem is at the vendors

506
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:20,700
are not really into these dialogues is
created I know who is researcher

507
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,040
when one resource OCI pool and you and
they say yeah we're coming back at you

508
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,540
and now this is more secure

509
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,910
and basically you don't have the screen

510
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,970
of create you and Saint Anselm

511
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,150
dialogue also the thing is I'm

512
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,890
very often it's considered to be

513
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,850
in a perfect world sOooo what happens is
that

514
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,220
the vendors are deploying in the
releasing a

515
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,080
equipment based on the standards and
then to give it to operators

516
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,250
and users every for them was it deployed
themself

517
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,929
a also for it was the pre themself but
I'm

518
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,120
the design it's considered totally
different from the production which is

519
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,890
not my work okay so as a consequence of
these

520
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,630
is that everything is we do

521
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,660
only these bottles at work and the rest
would be secured by at

522
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,530
AP sec that's the mentality so it's on
capsule eating

523
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,650
everything and use that to make things
work well some people have to take

524
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,520
shortcuts

525
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,230
and the single-shot good that he's taken
there's no difference in def

526
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,060
so all the securities that was supposed
to be believed

527
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,370
a perfect thanks to 82nd corruption

528
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,090
well on the side there will be eighty
said because it doesn't skate

529
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,370
them you don't have any security the

530
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,120
if you look at at the complexity of it
its already quite complex

531
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,980
as Eve but that's not the reality that
the reality

532
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,500
xot actually is the is the new

533
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,640
people doing specification see the

534
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,710
real really TE's these on one layer
petite flap

535
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,060
and stock layers of stuff went above
that

536
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,300
this is another layer and just on top of
that

537
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,460
and ozone layer which is just a media so
what we see

538
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,050
is we have a stacking of communication
with this complexity it's impossible

539
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,600
to make things completely right and it's
very hard to scale

540
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,590
with total security

541
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,190
also one thing which is interesting is
that when

542
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,570
you do qualification of pelts meat is
dead

543
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,350
or Lt production that you always think

544
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,820
that after baby for my and map is going
to take quite some time

545
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,929
but it's okay I have two days in front
of me it's going to work

546
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:48,460
and he doesn't work at all the reason
for that

547
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,040
is that we're not into the same world
where you have one piece in that blog

548
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,310
and you have one network we have one you
found that plug

549
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,740
on maybe hundreds have different small

550
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,250
192 168 networks each of these

551
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,630
is one network elements so if you
connect

552
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,929
to for example to while away HSS

553
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,320
network element meet self to connect
also clustered

554
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,330
that would be the instance is going to
have

555
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,230
warm network 192 168 slash

556
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,590
16 and one that 172 that sixteen

557
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,620
flash twenty-something okay

558
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,669
so what we have is that we have an
enormous complexity of network

559
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:35,960
in on top of that each of these net

560
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,190
element may have he didn't universe

561
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,040
for example Zahid in universe of
everything bring back at the top

562
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,300
is the EP and I mention to if you take
zepa in which is used for

563
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,330
view 80+ over Lt that's one network

564
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,500
which has you own size of

565
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,109
IP addresses so we are talking already
about $60 million addresses to scan

566
00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:03,109
and then we have another network and
which is

567
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:06,340
the normal internet connection when you
have something

568
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,540
like 200 for typical operator between

569
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,060
the test AP and between special offers
between

570
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,380
MMF bpm okay so basically that

571
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,310
impossible to do manually if you try to
do it of course

572
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:26,430
you will fuck up like everyone trying to
do the security by handed

573
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,080
one thing that is interesting also is
that we've seen

574
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,510
disease network element many things are

575
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,609
every T in every could fall from the
past so

576
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:41,820
what we Hove is we have some people who
came into the main and said

577
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,590
the some guys we need to have security
and

578
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,920
what happened is that secretly is
actually

579
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,100
a very often understood as a magic
spread

580
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,730
a which has a funny taste and you spread
it

581
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,240
over any kind of code and so the lead
became secure

582
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,430
so for example we had the insecure
configuration file

583
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,510
with injection and what happened is not

584
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,060
as a security that was I did on that was
to actually

585
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,950
put a heart could de ski into everything
is that me to write or read from it

586
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,940
ends and think it's been cryptid nobody
can manipulate that

587
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,960
so what we heard is the funny example

588
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,960
going to try to see if we have concede

589
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,350
okay so we have this kernel for

590
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,830
these 0 file

591
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,380
of course well secured and what you have

592
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,610
is actually something which is just

593
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,560
derm descriptions so first we're talking
about death

594
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,640
here we go so the season the what kind
of security that you having to see the

595
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,250
pic meant

596
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,110
is that by just putting some sprinkle
some

597
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,170
AP sec and put some death there

598
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,380
sensible me to cure all then what you
don't have is

599
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,480
any current of real proper well so

600
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,660
engineering internal security there so

601
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,720
the thing you is I'm the stuff

602
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,830
is not only related to the inside of
machines

603
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:24,060
it's also related to the overall network
organization

604
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,460
but don't think it's limited to l2 stuff

605
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,650
it's also going overseas everything that
the systemic

606
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,660
is quite well as dawn so for example
what was real

607
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:40,160
own is how between operators to enable
roaming between

608
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,870
users from one country to another
country well

609
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,120
what is very unique here is that the
used proven technique which is it you

610
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,390
know if proven system

611
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,470
in order to distribute this information

612
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,950
so that was actually very good I D

613
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,080
and she said everything must be

614
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,470
uncompleted under AP think again and
what happens is that

615
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,620
of course not of course some systems

616
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,760
last time we had a jury exhorted mission
it was a end of last year

617
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,820
a there was something what's on our res
26 books

618
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,950
which where with you lookin root
password route no I P sake directly onto

619
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,190
the TRX network

620
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,760
and getting I came to this is as easy

621
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,240
as getting into the first unknown
operator with no security budget

622
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,420
which is present on this network to

623
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,600
in fury everything in telecom is very

624
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,180
keyed for I'm but when you look at
practice everyone is

625
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,360
which is that has been reedy specified
it has been really

626
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,540
decided a secure so now what we see is

627
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,850
we see some a if wrote about regulation
of

628
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,190
how to secure the network elements who
sells nordiques

629
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,290
how to secure and I'm here

630
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,000
one thing that is quite important is
that the base Pacific Asian that you're

631
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,360
going to ensure security debate testing
it

632
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,940
and this is not that they're so

633
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,970
what's evolving is that we r don't see
too much of the secretive Fort

634
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,530
its bit accepting some specific
operators who are doing this work

635
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,750
and pressuring the their equipment
manufacturer to do so

636
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,440
but what we see is that it was our
operators up pulling

637
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,590
more and more information in 20 secure
systems

638
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,960
to back in the days on zeese IDNs

639
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,560
the private Guinness of all telecom
industry you have only because he could

640
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,660
use the ATM

641
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,300
and which he can was on which operator
not

642
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,370
you have the location of the equipment
the

643
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:48,470
area code which enemy is responsible for
which location

644
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,570
Aria which HSS is the present at what

645
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,800
eighty address et cetera et cetera even
the identities of the user's

646
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,950
are starting to be stored into these I'm
not even talking about

647
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,620
nm as a mapping of phone numbers he's
not many

648
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,810
is just Intel more information so we see
that it's

649
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,860
exploding already it's not a cure okay

650
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,930
NOP really what's interesting is okay

651
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,400
he's been talking about the blah blah
blah since it began around the time

652
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,010
outweighed go from here how do I pull my

653
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,820
Lt operator well once again

654
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,700
may not be a glorious but it's actually
super simple

655
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,760
the thing you're having and some other
news to it's cool not

656
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,980
and EV's the main not is going to be
super useful because

657
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,290
when you're not lead you do have just
your

658
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,990
I key which is yours and the time where
you could connect directly to officer

659
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,220
our ski in 1918 network

660
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,640
element sweet where not featured is be
gone

661
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,720
we still see from time to time some
network we have what's that

662
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,800
but that's not the typical Vino de the
most difficult in ITT

663
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,820
is that when you're being not when
you're being that'd

664
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,530
the address that you're getting is
actually an address from a net block

665
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,840
which is and it broke off

666
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,040
the operator for it

667
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,740
and the operator have acquired

668
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,750
the stuff so what happens is that when

669
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,370
in a preacher of let's say five thousand
people 10,000 20,000 people

670
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,170
that medium-size we of some firewall

671
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,980
a administrator with the findings a fire
or team rules

672
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,240
what does he do he doesn't want to be
called every day so

673
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,050
he stays what are in cement blocks
attribute it to my organization

674
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,340
and what happens is you put these
network into

675
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,920
he's alone least when his final on that
should be fine

676
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,620
its in da moment blocks right but he
isn't on the list box

677
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,840
of course what you have his behalf all
the people that lived from the you know

678
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,500
these

679
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,060
de mickey would have and in town on the
block

680
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,870
but basically being on the road from one
look

681
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,860
loves the no it's a datacom rockers

682
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,030
into gets a the load balancer
administration port

683
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,720
and up so typical so often that you'd
say okay come on

684
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,010
the season basic AP pen test

685
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,040
but its be easy Quinn you have two to
one hundred device

686
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,850
it's not be easy Queen you have to to
26,000 the fights

687
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,490
okay and that the typical network for
network operators life

688
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,370
into my for network element i'm talking
about. IP network element

689
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,110
for a typical size of mom I P network
element

690
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,340
it's around 60,000 for each easy to pick
up

691
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,480
if you are doing stuff minute

692
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,750
also what's interesting is that you can
hike from

693
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:49,350
external all you don't need actually to
be

694
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:53,210
a customer from the operator so this is
quite fresh

695
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,350
the top a as you can see

696
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,610
I film basically what it is is

697
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,870
some network element unease treaties
access

698
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,480
42 on the sport you can enter any
comment that's going to change your

699
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,260
configuration of these

700
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,140
and what you have to remember my slide
Ugwu

701
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,420
ease actually the emerged network

702
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,910
in a moment of the enemy plus to the in
gateway per serving gateway

703
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,450
so what we have here is we have to Ricky

704
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,810
access to use a core network element of
an operator

705
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:32,120
in one operator doesn't leave much of
these in order to run

706
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,220
to Lt network some networks are using

707
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,580
for Ugwu from war way to ruin

708
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,030
wall country okay so

709
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,050
already falsies guy here a this

710
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:50,060
already to have them were exposed on the
Internet boom gone so damn

711
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,180
do you you won't get these you really
need to scan for the seats

712
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,660
but the thing which is interesting is
that you don't even need to go for as

713
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,260
he's a

714
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:03,120
heavy lifting of the scan the new

715
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,870
and the using the crowbar want to your
local is

716
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,430
your base station you could you don't
need to go physical guys

717
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:14,800
you can read from your home so what's
interesting is that

718
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,530
why don't forget more no teeth

719
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,970
about hacking into the about people

720
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,800
one it's not known to tell people what
actively hacking into these

721
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,140
what I have no interest of having a real
hacker

722
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,590
up burn their all access

723
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,420
to the operator and what's very
interesting here

724
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,510
is that a tenth affair where some

725
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,820
unknown intelligence agencies back
toward some

726
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,550
I'm including to Ericsson switches well

727
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,440
those guru and there's a reason why
people born 3d

728
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,710
communicate about these there's an
interest for nations

729
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,830
to keep access to take 'em operator

730
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,120
you to move bias one thing that is
interesting is that

731
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,450
most of the time we're only a load to do

732
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:11,210
testing Leichhardt got this thing on LT
equipment which is

733
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,530
in that has bet and we always say to the
customer the season more secure

734
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,140
and it will be in production and didn't
get as I'd

735
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,150
what are you talking about not the thing
is

736
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,860
once again then me here is complexity so
what you have

737
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,660
is you're going to always have some this
complexity which are

738
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,110
is going to burn you and he's going to
confirm a security

739
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,080
once again different lack of difference
in deaf lack of testing

740
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,720
and here people fear that they are going
to crush something

741
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,820
well it's better to crash it when you're
starting the network

742
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,990
than when you have your $50 million
subscriber on it

743
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,030
another order but by if is up

744
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,570
both sorry

745
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,670
also one thing which is I'm very
saddened

746
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,540
is that income of access vendors

747
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,750
are doing I'm some

748
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,550
some eat then squirt kick in order

749
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:17,270
to prefent anyone from having access to
zzzz

750
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,760
to arm don't look for research programs
don't look for

751
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,230
actual communications up zzzz a

752
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,770
the typical um Veet

753
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,780
communication with these people

754
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,590
who is the sender starts with do you
have the license for the product with

755
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,760
this thing

756
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,830
are you our direct customers that have a
to

757
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,570
we are very nice I'm doing he said
responsible disclosure bullshit

758
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:47,240
a for basically something like a

759
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,690
couple of years for years that they that
point we we said

760
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:54,260
stop this it's not working these people
making fun of us

761
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,420
I'm basically it's not it's not being
Eve

762
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,010
even efficient for our customers
operators

763
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:04,030
so he said if we don't have a commercial
contract with you

764
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,170
we don't communicate information to you
that not

765
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:11,310
responsible discover thats professional
disclosure

766
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,480
so what we did is we started to do that
with these guys

767
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,920
electric work much better these people
understand

768
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,710
only and I'm talking about the vendors
you're paying for something

769
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,000
actually these are going to try to
optimize and not have

770
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,050
so many hours basting wasted because

771
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,710
they pay for it at the beach at but
thats

772
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,050
what we have in their what there are
also

773
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,600
doing is brings the operator saying why
don't talk to

774
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,270
was the independent

775
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,530
security vendor security researchers
these people don't know

776
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,190
our systems how could they know reverse
engineering is not for frogs

777
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:55,490
well the think the season really what's
breaking

778
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,510
the security of these operators okay so

779
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,760
to finish and term 222

780
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,910
basically a give you our my my feeling

781
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,100
it's really changing now just because
the domain is a

782
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,730
is opening up and thats really what's
going on

783
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,250
is the progress

784
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,030
of security in telecom he sings to
people like

785
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:25,230
I'm thinking about calling me neither
I'm cursor is thinking about Charlie

786
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:25,610
Miller

787
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:30,650
I'm thinking about the 60-year people in
Burley numbers looking about

788
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,880
a the people from on W

789
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,020
basically each independent security
researchers at

790
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,640
at some point with access to the
equipment

791
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,880
and from there started to do their own
research and as we see doing your own

792
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,000
research is actually not very difficult

793
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,070
one thing that is interesting also is
that

794
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,740
a due to the information leaks know you
can perfectly get a proper

795
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,330
good knowledge about to cum security
without doing anything illegal

796
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,430
just by reading screed or any kind of
PDF

797
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,869
posting systems the are unleashing

798
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:08,440
tones of intel on information because
vendors

799
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,020
strategy of not releasing information is
biting them

800
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,500
in the back because things they don't
release information

801
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,750
people have to share by themself and the
sherry of course we social network some

802
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:20,580
stuff like that

803
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,560
so we have steel

804
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,410
a problem feeling a bit like the
nineteen eighties into como

805
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:33,200
domain from you could expect to have
better security with

806
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,980
Lt despite the fact that if he was built

807
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,080
for security and I repeat

808
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,800
this is some things that he's going not
to be a knowledge

809
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,810
by the people into this become industry

810
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,369
and only some vendors are doing

811
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:53,560
some active a reverse engineering
program

812
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,869
via BT research am wanted to read
effective easy always tweet

813
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:03,720
outside of the vendors looking so

814
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,150
thank you very much for your attention
and I'm if you have questions that's a

815
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,910
moment to

816
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:15,910
to shoot here

817
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:20,780
attorney questions for Philip we have a
few minutes on

818
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:27,279
up if

819
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:31,579
why do they connect the Node B sin then
they have to why not in the layer 3

820
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:36,400
sorry state why are the you know piece
in the layers to network level of course

821
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,959
they are

822
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:40,459
also on the earlier three but layer 3 is
going to be firewalled

823
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:44,319
by typically what is called the security
gate we which is cool

824
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:49,160
most of the time who who go look at. the
we the

825
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,289
I'm serving gateway okay so you have

826
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:56,170
is around breed you access network and
you have the Evolved Packet core as the

827
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:56,869
EPC

828
00:50:56,869 --> 00:51:00,039
NZ's are separated by the security gate
we

829
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:04,069
so the most high Q can do is always a
hike that you can do it

830
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:07,700
layer 2 homes around side when you're

831
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,740
on the new okay because mostly usually
to try to do things well

832
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,520
adds a layer 3 from zeese respective
it's totally different

833
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,520
if you're seeing UPC if you're the into
the

834
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,339
recalling correctly for packet core it
boots I say in the state your

835
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:24,119
presentation

836
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,809
all the Hino be starting a single AF to
domain but then that's not cool

837
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:31,849
yes yet they still they are into a
single layer 2 network

838
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:35,150
all the newbies ok

839
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,910
so you yeah it makes sense now you like
okay

840
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,030
in term of affects your face you just
might be played it

841
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,140
by basically is a square offer in ODIs

842
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,440
and don't think it performs poems that
I'm sorry performance problems

843
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,329
if they have it all on the same to but
you can you cook

844
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:57,400
do something totally from a
configuration perspective you could say

845
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,549
I'm not going to room from friends too
must say

846
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:06,670
because the handover is going to be from
Perry's to must say I'm going to be from

847
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,359
parties to work today maybe

848
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:11,869
to a city which is close to each other
who could say

849
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:16,059
yep I could firewall foresee you'd be
easy which are

850
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:20,049
in one location just like says that
occasion which are closed betray to

851
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,609
thinking to my final rules what that
implies

852
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:26,250
its totally crazy does a could be that
the explosion here

853
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:31,740
kill think a good any more questions

854
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:38,740
question and doing to talk you were

855
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,160
talk talk about having specialists can
assess specialist

856
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,679
testing

857
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,289
Sophia can you wear act elaborate a
little bit on that

858
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:51,999
yeah the I'm not going to elaborate
image because he's a commercial product

859
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:52,339
that

860
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,949
we publish to that's not the goal for
security reasons conferences

861
00:52:55,949 --> 00:53:02,560
we can talk about that locator

862
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,190
nuance

863
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,120
no okay well phillipe thank you very
much for thank you very much

864
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,590
he was lucky to

865
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,950
be true to form of we do not give

866
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,460
thank you
