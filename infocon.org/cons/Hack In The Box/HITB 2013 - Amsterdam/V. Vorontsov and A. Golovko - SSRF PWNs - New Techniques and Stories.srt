1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,690
well

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,690
well

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,730
yes

4
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,400
right in home

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,280
pay hiding my name's by the Marin from

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
on sickle up company and a how onto

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,790
get this report because it was my friend
Alexander but his is a verdict that's

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,430
not so

9
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,150
good but also critical of course I want
to speak about the

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,260
so such a pest the forgery attacks on

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,760
phones using it but that sound and
something about

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,130
I new techniques and do something about
to a real stories from Mary what

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,750
programs

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,710
use in so such a course for jokes saw

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,490
its monster and something about us

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,619
on time and Alexander founder so far

17
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,080
small repetition security company in
Russia since

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,310
nine-year and am web application
security expert and the host a book on

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,320
the Analects under

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,530
he said network security expert and also
did down and I'm

21
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,320
and maintain your Nov packages no
company I'm

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,200
haver English walk began follow us

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,810
and also by Peter and the we alighted by
if something there are problems such as

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,970
Google and Dixon

25
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,830
another not another about problems also
want a great yet another obligation

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,890
federal solution

27
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,510
I think it's a sorting through and as
its all

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,640
and what about so such a purse fortunate
suicide because forger

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,140
X first son describe it in eight-year by

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,270
there'll kaelin at the smoke on
conference and then they reincarnated by

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,990
me during their young six-month offer
security box of eleven year

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,989
it's the Phils for implementation of
this suicide because for

33
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,580
thanks I using their X mixer on into the
viability

34
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,459
and then a and next year and the

35
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,250
itself via 10-game Sosa as for that
thanks

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,630
by you this gun guys Alex on the
political front me bitches talkin

37
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,010
and successfully exploited SAP system an

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,739
of course use in new techniques

39
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,209
of our go for political schemer average
from white house to make

40
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,830
party early party early if and any TCP
packet

41
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,870
in inside Ian and from there and then a

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,139
this kind of attacks no rediscovered by

43
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,660
areas billy conn and of

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,060
on Sophia owns an exploitive and custom
for CJ by Asa gains in tonight's

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,750
conference

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,889
and the at the final of our year

47
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,139
on our techniques so such a cause for
children

48
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,000
I was reminded by white fit security as
second place in the top 10

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,090
a pack and techniques of 12 here and the

50
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,139
for also go to

51
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,290
CV number of our 900 18

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,370
8 saw

53
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,950
something about

54
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,120
I as a sort of a game an lead to suicide
because forgery from what they care in

55
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,370
the

56
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,700
from a defender so senator just
fortunate and by

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,250
CV noon and it's not describe it

58
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,750
in and currently because on

59
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,290
because in again seen definition of city
is that

60
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,630
and suicide before Judge taxes that's
error

61
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:01,410
ability to use in their Uriel from using
parameters and their uses

62
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,549
as a source of rain and

63
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,100
and make it but it's not so

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,100
character Thames current definition

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,560
and because not only have serious are
vulnerable to so is that it was for

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,540
today and not

67
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,870
on leasing urals agency is simple
example of

68
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,300
peace because which vulnerable to
service at a press for truth is out

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,930
urals in their use the parameters I can
also

70
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,360
use circuit injection such as Cyril F
injection

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,730
to socket timeout to forge very crafty
can

72
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,690
and this case changes destination
address destination port but you can

73
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,970
chain share make it to most

74
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,290
and and get this over such a request for
that of course again because

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,319
it's so not to logic

76
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,300
in a publication saying simple injection
and the service had the good fortune of

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,740
course

78
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,479
polls saw before you start

79
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,729
found so said it was for Jeff X

80
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,500
and describe it to the some sluts ago
used to bypass

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,870
Force Base the sanitation it's obviously
implementation of this kind of attacks

82
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,629
and explodes

83
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,039
also use to for bypass farrell's

84
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,210
own and the

85
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,300
abusing that trust relationships and the

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,449
may be used for other as I have them
implementation some other kinds

87
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,919
of our expectations but is there other

88
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,440
and any other ways to does the same you
there

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,550
any other race 2 bypass firewalls to
bypass

90
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,979
and abusive cosby styles 24 chip packets

91
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,129
from an host which one see

92
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,810
abuse that's not a one method

93
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,139
and the for a long time ago and the
early

94
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,389
19th describe it simple techniques
called

95
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,400
often I think you off know of know this
dick nixon details

96
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,699
phone hello from the early 1950s

97
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,599
Beach works looks nowadays

98
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,409
and bitten mine main idea of

99
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:16,599
YouTube disproven based on at back and
forth between

100
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,759
and network interfaces at this featured
if you're in able by default in Debian

101
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,030
and preferably Nexus

102
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,220
and as a as the

103
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,510
and

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,320
abrasion systems I'm and you debate it
can be easily sent from a

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,740
internet and bike or 6 percent the pic

106
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,670
in nominee foster's an GDP and not the
load from a great network from internet

107
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,070
but

108
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,070
an it's very very security forces

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,650
in vid in this case began holes
exploited you DP

110
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,350
by a simple by in cash hosts

111
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,910
man's is forcing to abuse at out the
other

112
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,140
on as the customer service costs and

113
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,860
it's not agree an you can exploit your

114
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,230
S&P min cash than does the UPS plus
Force Base it's also worth

115
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,260
S&P not so was based

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,130
but you can exploit issues and public
key

117
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,730
its very own very common station to
protect from this

118
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,190
use the Seas sees city in it they'll

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,910
an net dot IP version 4

120
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,820
not gone your interface in a min RP
fuser from

121
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,580
sees City it's enabled by default and
abuse lookin

122
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,960
from there is 19 stone out its so

123
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,140
a density peaceful think exploitation
which

124
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,180
he is it duren I was curtailed if in
doubt the

125
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,740
search work based on exploitation

126
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,820
an services as said

127
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,940
this is so so so the best for you it's a

128
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,400
also known also called

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,190
a reflection on tax and and the on
well-known

130
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,500
since since 19th

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,700
but no you can exploits system

132
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,550
my posse in federal spending it I think
at next light

133
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,600
try to to describe this from a currently

134
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,550
and symbols profound effects reflection
affects

135
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,210
where service response use it ascetic
rest another service

136
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,960
useful fair initial picket and

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,260
and described and respected

138
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,340
source address to and as a host

139
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,550
reach you want to exploit and this
summer get your crest

140
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,660
and the generate an generate a response

141
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,580
to your so so this spot for the address
and exploit something

142
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,160
and in a deep network through federal c5
farrell's

143
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,170
heifer are all too does this of course

144
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,150
and put it back if I think if that
source AP port from a victim in them

145
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,580
also infinite implications security
remained guess that's my favorite

146
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,210
service

147
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,310
because use it used use it in

148
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,550
great number of our customers and the

149
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,810
for Force Base the fifth position in
most cases

150
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,010
am or and of course episode is

151
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,590
if you've if you've confined to a
service and modern infrastructure

152
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,190
network infrastructures and shows a
service is ideal for this purpose

153
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,160
because a service

154
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160
and January response as the same as the
request

155
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,420
sir nazis saw answer is simple
reflection

156
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,850
a reflection a bag

157
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,800
and though also may be known me may call
to service over such a cross-border

158
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,400
attacks

159
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,060
this is a monster and the monster 12

160
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,900
exploit forced bi on through Farrell

161
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,550
most have no ability to send make it
very clear to put be because farrell's

162
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,520
a federal hours strictest I could Musser

163
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,050
can use a techniques from here in
nineteen

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,480
and my sis Beaufort make it lead to be
picked it because

165
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,880
a you've crossed the picket I and the
next night I went to

166
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,250
speak about this if you also I'm
something about

167
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,420
just about you to be most suitable for
Beckett and

168
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,470
to force a and set them source address
and

169
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,660
destination address to cosby then forced
a generated

170
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,400
answer to response %um response to

171
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,610
this picket and sent it to cosby of
course because

172
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,680
because it's a for previously fact

173
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,920
some and in exploitation and guest

174
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,870
on we research ship in Ponca take

175
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,000
perfect of this exploitation simple way

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,060
time of course reflection effect depends
on your protocol

177
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,540
on your response for months on and

178
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,250
to do reflection a text and you must

179
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,760
you must find a service

180
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,540
and Beach music a relation between

181
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,690
responses and request and a response
request

182
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,830
on responsive but it must be

183
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,450
village as a request tools and as a
service it's a

184
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,010
some main idea of reflection takes

185
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,700
you want at Phils a at first point to

186
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,920
monster Spofford a picket

187
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,950
to set their key in memcached to post a

188
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,110
and K have a value starts issuing

189
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,980
can see legislate and then monster
against poverty you break it

190
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,600
and the kid that their get

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,810
get this key and gay have name

192
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,570
key keep and then this buddhist pickett
and

193
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,440
fed and a source on this picket of cosby

194
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,490
send a pic to first a min guest of
course and

195
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,660
for state generator Jr response to cosby

196
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,760
me the real you of States need to be
causes

197
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,440
as that was be parse this request as a

198
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,710
to independent Commons just common sense
value key is

199
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,030
for it's not correct Commons

200
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,880
but parson continue and states comments
executed at first be

201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,410
its main main idea of does this affect

202
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,490
but they're also not so would because

203
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,250
on and after this injection

204
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,320
cost a it was be in established a
infinite

205
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,480
infinite session and and

206
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,680
and by exchange it bites engine that
Hannah

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,480
era Commons and this is really if you
need

208
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,720
infinite circle and but anyway

209
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,500
monster injected the comments into cosby
and this is

210
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,550
this is working attacks saw

211
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,629
and and this led to conceive anticipate
them for for

212
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,439
this affects and the Red collar arm

213
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:24,430
me Madrid column marked

214
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,920
an initial request from the the
green-collar

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,939
marked in

216
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:36,170
main idea of the South Aiken's injection
and then you can see also a red

217
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,379
Attard collards a bottom-up slight an
infinite

218
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,810
infinite cycle of invest exchange

219
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,670
so and do you can see also simple common
to do this

220
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,810
and the the as a top-flight and

221
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,120
puny by a red red by the red color

222
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,720
on marked and the

223
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,850
injection data and green collared so
YouTube the Cedar

224
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,370
you be here each min cast understand so

225
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,850
hello from twelfth year

226
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,000
and itself yeah it is you first open

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,930
and collaboration and been implemented
in the Linux kernel since that's 3.6

228
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,120
just before stopping provide us

229
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,509
two-cent seen plus the to big tits in
there

230
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,639
one in when Beckett and

231
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,189
its look like am best way to spoof Inc
TCP packets but not so

232
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,670
go to because some simple as deter-

233
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,990
also require and special Kum Kee

234
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,079
drafted by server is a you show classic

235
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,110
it's begun action and sent to client to

236
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,370
Creighton's you connection by using to
be first open

237
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,309
it's not so good thought I care because
since the Linux implementation

238
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:04,740
kooky and generates by advance the
convictions tendered II region Dale

239
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,509
as you know a isn't picky and the client
AP

240
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,139
Keith ever and 60 bytes length

241
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,350
and it's not so brutal ball of

242
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,880
real-time on

243
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,319
but he is still

244
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,399
on isolated for OSA

245
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,910
defoe implementations an example
Microsoft Kin

246
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,959
do something Boehner bill on as a when
does

247
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,970
saw and to be first open

248
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,540
I also have a by design security
limitations

249
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:46,269
not some box but for only limitations
just limitations the 124 all client

250
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:46,920
sports

251
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,540
and if you

252
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,970
no kooky home tools is planned you can
forge

253
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,389
any big tits to any ports resulting in
sticks in by Sir

254
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,579
server validates only claimed the and
and

255
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,139
second limitée limitation this one
security

256
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,800
for us over for all plants if you know
it's okay you can

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,329
January default plants but it's not
possible at this moment to know

258
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:17,009
as its okay some

259
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,160
on and other next though

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,600
of attacks and network attacks in
general is the same offer

261
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,079
so is that a good fortune effect ECU's
Inc AP version

262
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,170
6 its implementation widely

263
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,279
widely in use it at this moment

264
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,910
and the the can be used simple to bypass
the first such a threat to expressions

265
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,240
which artistic

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,630
and local host min local host the

267
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,790
on domain name and the a

268
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,720
a few years and four 100

269
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,179
Brendan seeks the 0 that 0 the

270
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:05,689
one I ate the address may use into an IP
version 6

271
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,520
local weather is also can be exploited
link local farrell's bypass

272
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,679
and exploiting out the configurations IP
version 6

273
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,709
in detail said the this light first

274
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,839
just before stopping concept that excuse
it history

275
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,540
as a 2-1 cookin for client

276
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,600
and the any pots in the

277
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,149
faults and then it's only concept on the
for

278
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,470
my mind experiment not in real cases

279
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,230
in and can be exploited

280
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,659
the while the any manager in the clout
to change

281
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,770
ate the other is so if you're forced and
if months or have

282
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,110
assists to cost a visa AP address

283
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,639
eighty an he can I generated

284
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:59,370
to be first open kooky for the city
address and a it's a moment

285
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,399
in the future when on

286
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:08,730
both manager change if the address was
on monster ads and UAB addresses can

287
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,889
exploit the exploiters of

288
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,909
make it for for his previous

289
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,419
a bill dress it's abuse me and the I
think its the

290
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,120
not for another comments and some
religious be first opened

291
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,280
by design limitation I think rights must
be described in RFC

292
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,460
saw IP version 6 and local other sis

293
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,770
I when does it take while our security
audits and

294
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,139
exploitation oak lawn's based on

295
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:44,030
the based on

296
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,710
he'd need to think about link local
address is and because

297
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,850
many on system admins and forget about
this addresses

298
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,309
and the me good people fireballs

299
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:58,419
only only a.m.

300
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,620
by using currently in maybe there's an

301
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,850
before addresses or IP version 6

302
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,090
but not link local address and for stain

303
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,630
is a monster can and

304
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:15,110
can we use can bypass firewalls the use
in care

305
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,059
link local address is of course be must
have gone

306
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,290
try to sleeve broadcasters to

307
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,120
the to mine addresses link local address
is so far

308
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,780
cosby or but the of course it's required
privileges

309
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,120
ok can use in

310
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,920
you can use mmm AP

311
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,320
in global EP version fix by make
completer

312
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,910
but not in Zim microsoft network because
Microsoft oh no I'll get to

313
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,110
generates IP version 6 o'clock link
local address is

314
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,670
by Mick certainly on the from randoms

315
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,490
so nothing

316
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,820
yet another implementation of IP version
thanks to provide us

317
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,920
to do the same as a sister F so sad
because such attacks is the use in Cairo

318
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,930
to advertisement

319
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,870
me again declare an

320
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,590
months ago on their forced same network
segment

321
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,610
sir be composed and also require

322
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:23,020
religious because there no ways to forge
Road advancement bakit

323
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,030
without root privileges months a

324
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,770
ever possibility to lose this and the

325
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,300
me great and creative a repeat it
differs be

326
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,960
with you link local and you AP version
fix addresses

327
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,310
cosby by default any and

328
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,960
numbers of abrasion systems such as
they've been in there arrest him to gain

329
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,540
and have enabled a future

330
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,390
to a beer in six configuration bar buy a
router advertisement but

331
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,410
I try again is through as this require
is it was the

332
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,620
be exists in the one that works igman
not from Internet

333
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,940
only in the 1980 skin pigment and then
I'm

334
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,630
of course cosby receive cherry pick up

335
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,040
and at the UAB version 6 address

336
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
to his interface and

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,630
now there are no waz to block the Sun
dress because it's your address on the

338
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,340
farrell's

339
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,820
based on blacklists will be bypassed

340
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,700
Kansas case so was a conclusion

341
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,060
was based as much that of course there's
no way to protect your

342
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,600
because based on supposed use and care
for animals and other sets

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,560
North not so good idea to Street

344
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,030
network network firewalls

345
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,080
to bong to protect your services

346
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,310
am really a great idea to implement

347
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,790
its authorizations

348
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,780
cost and this really work

349
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,600
saw now we start now I can start about

350
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,040
thought about suicide circus foreign
particles scheme us

351
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,330
and tried to soaked you about this he
must and

352
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,090
also on 12 speak about Somerset

353
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,920
a good fortune not only in the
publication's that's not

354
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,740
good idea to describe suicides because
for attacks

355
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,680
as their as a treat of publications not
so on

356
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,110
correct because sp so

357
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm few slights ago

358
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,830
on so said before that thanks can be
also used in

359
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,290
exploited by symbols reflections perfume
cologne something

360
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,610
and other ways not only publications
some

361
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,610
protocol schemas

362
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,340
different protocols provides

363
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,600
do what I can different actions of
course because protocols

364
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,610
ever himself

365
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,810
make it for months and the any

366
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,300
implementation of this former picket

367
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,370
this from my dad picket famed and

368
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,750
not on the same data but also can leak
data

369
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,010
and if you have a so said it was
fortunate in in

370
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,860
and bake it to be is the to reach you
want to see if you can sneezes

371
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,020
simple by directness picket to

372
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,550
as the cost of orch destination address
for something else three

373
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,040
describe it in so sad because 4G people
22 it's a

374
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,670
chapter of exploitation original occurs
the Disney yeah

375
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,730
so not so you but it's on you

376
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,660
political c'mon donor and I

377
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,870
I think I really am a rare

378
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,400
implemented by out exists in coral and
the sand

379
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,330
in the Brewers there's an object of
course before global

380
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,670
fix of practical schemes and the
nettlesome

381
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,380
and donut political schema provide but i
cant to read data from

382
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,550
is to begin from is to the inn of
bronzes

383
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,680
which can be a sister effort by Tiger

384
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,940
it's maybe a its me bro I

385
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,030
to read all clients the time case of
common

386
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,080
jittery and if it's TJ but not so of
Commons whiskey

387
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,700
in in nowadays and so bad that

388
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,900
in what's mott beach P ways or

389
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,110
fast CGI and in

390
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,040
studious use the dow on 0 device

391
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,830
bites common to the interface issue for
interpersonal pups and

392
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,080
also with have dotnet implementation Jen
implementation

393
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,540
which defense or on the application
server and

394
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,610
now application logic it's a really am
nice idea to

395
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,340
focus sturdiness stood out process using
suicide because Georgia Tech's

396
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,570
and for not only make its my family and
the exportation just only

397
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,410
system system process data its really

398
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,740
must be under standard by Iris and who
want to exploit

399
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,170
so sad because for texts really possible
and really is a phone

400
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,230
many cases saw

401
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,680
I want to ask you which says whoever has
the most secure in your

402
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,090
environment and your network environment
I think rights

403
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,760
VPN server because the bins for and
basically front India

404
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,980
front-end however minutes to process
from Internet and the

405
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,580
you must the country over VPN server

406
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,380
is a maximum security with restrictions
there is a maximum security privileges

407
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,370
and

408
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,200
followed by security updates for the
service also weaken

409
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,480
transfers thats any of the security so
good last service

410
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,250
the most secure in the over public and
your network

411
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,790
environment it's a also be dismissed
because

412
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,520
I think that the security secret lair is
a must is a must for most

413
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,950
security in and security

414
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,170
go are for for any any in

415
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,930
in network services such as a birth such
as

416
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,400
VPN such as HTTP college de beers of
course

417
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,960
and other out the house in but

418
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,940
it's not so corner because saddam
because you can't wait to

419
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,680
sister republic infrastructure its it's
really great

420
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,480
and a favor to cats its would get its
not so good

421
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,110
on

422
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,920
climbed can great the

423
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,660
self-signed certificates and include as
service said request for genetics

424
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,270
vector insight as serial file to be in
the city to get

425
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,510
inside their on line 63 it's that this
political

426
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,850
Uriel filed inside the banks them
protocol

427
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,450
and the may be out there an extended
attributes of certificates and then

428
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,130
sends the city gates as a client
certificate

429
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,410
to public infrastructure who is this
elevated now

430
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,160
a cellular data ever to waste and maybe
three ways to

431
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,550
military justification in your

432
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,900
I think described as the

433
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,030
this a.m exploitation of course depends
on

434
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,640
service SSL and ability to logic

435
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,050
as a validation logic and check
certificates and trust for

436
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,780
relationships between between before and
validation of the ticket stubs

437
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,910
on its defense only by a implementation
of

438
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,050
as a cell and not described in RFC
something another

439
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,840
documents and instructions tomlin by
developer choose

440
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,670
that means system administration ships
external resources

441
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,250
say said before can be defined it in
certificates such as cereal

442
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,710
file policies be filed his the filed
euros and

443
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,810
me doubtless and defense on current

444
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,330
implementation of said and the calf
cause

445
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,750
saw different implementation of

446
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,900
K by a green-collar not Bonneville and
buyer at Colorado noble

447
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,760
on simple way engine its way

448
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,540
to check cereal cyst be not from my
certificates by

449
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,800
on the from and config and

450
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,840
there's no way to exploit engine
excusing disaffected actor because you

451
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,150
can

452
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,960
change engine ex-convict from Internet
I'm

453
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
also a good way and two check trust
relationships

454
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,130
a check sign she of CE immediacy and

455
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,190
you see use ascension I'm

456
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,590
before taken City tickets that

457
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,680
it's a good read but also can be

458
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,020
bonneville in Serie if you know where
private key of C

459
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,340
but if you if you know private key FAA I
think

460
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,800
so is such a quest for Jen tax it's not
needed for you can exploit things

461
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,060
resulted bed based implementation of

462
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,260
services because for Jim missus and to
provide so such a good stories chicken

463
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,750
certificates that was before trust
relationship such as C

464
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,430
and a intimated see and other is

465
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,330
chicken and immediacy certificates that
was before trust relationship because

466
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,430
immediate seating see also can be great
by like every still sign it

467
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,630
on a ritzy Sansone yeah

468
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,210
is a this light to conceive Anna

469
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,790
different for and different from

470
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,350
books he must've verify certificates
Algar

471
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,270
first columnists on in

472
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,320
I and even those asked me to

473
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,410
don't disclose a when this name which

474
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,810
vulnerable to this and I think this when
their pay

475
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:07,730
and the implementation first column
based on a simple check the first

476
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,740
uses certificated so find it
certificated

477
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,920
very addictive this rejected and if not

478
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,560
and certificates possible and the

479
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,680
start to certificates will be validated
and you can find

480
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,360
you can find his services before
Jackson's This case it's

481
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,090
is it too understand and because say so
the game

482
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,060
serial Uriel houses Purell and thanks
them for the call you real

define it mystification self-signed

485
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,400
such as South sign it's the exploit

486
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,120
rock and the second column

487
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,270
dance also on the bill I'll gun are
certificates the Phils stage in the

trust relations to be forced to consign

491
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,780
ship to force

492
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,890
compare and compares the sea

493
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,910
be there trustees store and

494
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,040
again at Becker can cell ok can

495
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,720

30s be in versus be

497
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,650
israel's in CE or intimidate CE
certificated

498
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,460
it's not so business of had to attack
your

499
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,580
from the stands and xenon

500
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,350
and assault golem and I can see a nice
in

501
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,920
SSL implementations to beach Phils
validated

502
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,920
and trust relations and signed should
before certificate status validation its

503
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,580
eg another vendors implementation way of

504
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,380
some chicken other and

505
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,310
think have slowed yes legislate against
the

506
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,780
mean a scheme of was a Starbucks

507
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,260
and months or issue is certificated
serial

508
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,430
an assist the NTSB files

509
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:19,060
which reference the to internal cosby
and sends a certificate to force the

510
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,470
maybe VPN server os: a server

511
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,210
Beach validated plan certificates and
it's not so

512
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,320
easy to and uses in the wild because

513
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,410
and Minnesota such as obligation service
by default

514
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,710
center to plant file sent to client

515
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,790
duren Association each

516
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,220
I'm not want to check your certificates
but anyway

517
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,900
a few much to head chanute elysa lazar
is a celebrity

518
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,980
who can anyway sent Anna City Fugate

519
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,030
to a server and any source and

520
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,660
i think is a must Gulf come number of
also lists

521
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,350
over self-service can poss this
certificate and

522
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,230
as an start evaluation process

523
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,340
and the same answer again exploited the
cosby

524
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,440
an in this case in in cash

525
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,310
area of guest its my as my break

526
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,060
saw something about arm

527
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,720
service at requests forgery practice

528
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,160
a size that again I can't disclose
vendors to

529
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,670
my head to go off principles in their
public infrastructure

530
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:39,310
attacks but you can tests as a type 2

531
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,300
on your on your VPN service on your

532
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,850
MapSource on your application servers
and other implementations

533
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:53,850
of salient I think it should work

534
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,360
now about something about our so is that
the best for you to practice

535
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,520
arm the

536
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,910
try to but respond

537
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:14,740
young X my bounty system and Iraq
program

538
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,500
and find something to Houston exploit it
memcached in the young vixen from that

539
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,960
you think so said it was forgery and
discovered a few internet services

540
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,419
and the young bucks network and also

541
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,740
discovered for main infrastructure box

542
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,890
which accepted by am texting as a
critical

543
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,700
and also got a fun skills of course
because service at a price for it thanks

544
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,399
its something you for us and the
something new for

545
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,770
for community I think and we release

546
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:52,110
try to shock young tech security some

547
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm our results 11 so such requests for
the box

548
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,610
without classic ways to use XOM XAR
ended

549
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:05,090
7 x6 here plus so said it was fortunate
box

550
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:08,270
and

551
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,370
much money and earth

552
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,840
I reach and so fun said

553
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,960
Sun 100 fixed in

554
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,770
dole Aspire One bach it's not so good at
not so

555
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,400
but not so on critical because some
Mikes much to my

556
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,440
about system in Yandex countries on

557
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,280
100 then fernando's saw

558
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,340
nice nice so sad because produce story

559
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,430
use incurred the news service young
Texas a Google have a

560
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,800
mosser must have service provides 10
young Texan Google have

561
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,630
really really similar services

562
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,670
and muster service provides

563
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,450
content receiving on but on leave from
your posts

564
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,580
your site's and is this validation
process based on files and yes

565
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,890
records not so good I did because
verification by the main

566
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,960
but not by AP and the you great supply
connector

567
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,370
not verified on when and then change a
record

568
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,620
to this domain inside the young Texan
friend to

569
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,620
fight receive content from internet

570
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,860
of I think it's obviously in

571
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,520
and use the text about a bitch work

572
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,830
mock you can see is this the slide a

573
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,520
saying the face of muster young sex with
my store

574
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,620
to and you can see

575
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,420
my domain it's mine post and you can see
is that my the mind

576
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,670
have it a record two young pics internet

577
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,859
and the piracy for content each market
by red collar

578
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,960
at the bottom a slight easy and relief

579
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,130
really car because now I have

580
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,950
assists to young Texans on it restricted
only by firewalls

581
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,900
but I have no voice to validate

582
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,230
parables rules I have only try to

583
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,170
to receive data from some hosts which I
can

584
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,370
can what I can use also of

585
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,960
a fun its con- using this as a ref it's
not say decal for me

586
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,290
yes because it's January ideas

587
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,640
idea solids and the it's not buyer about
program because throughout program

588
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,250
on mean that you can also explore it a
front and back for the implication bikes

589
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,940
no such as logic bypasses Xs and Os a

590
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,090
suicide pacts also but not by

591
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,190
not mean and exploitation of his box

592
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,190
I'm using group hug and experts not so

593
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,090
for not so hard to understand to find
forced internet and nothing more

594
00:37:55,090 --> 00:38:00,210
and exploit exportation of SRF 30
percent to start to its not so radical

595
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:00,880
for me

596
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,120
and I use this only for validity
setbacks

597
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,620
undersea for not critical and not
sensors

598
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,220
sent sentences data from internet but

599
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,470
but to demonstrate and that I have a
says to

600
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,750
are restricted by fireballs from from
internets

601
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,609
costs so

602
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:28,680
and this led to conceive simple way to
fine

603
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,760
config files in Google and

604
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,920
someone from young texting published

605
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,920
configuration file Google in

606
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,490
forum and the Google indexer this file
and I find this

607
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,940
is incurred a simple command-line I'm

608
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,050
I think it's not not a problem for
thicker

609
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,760
and I think it's ethical I N

610
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,620
couldn't use networks con and other

611
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:01,780
break black race 2 exploitation of
service as a good fortune and the can

612
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,210
validate

613
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,650
me this is kind of what I can validate
my so said it was forged exploit

614
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,520
there's a slight you can say the address

615
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,880
which and which holds a slight

616
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,560
song involves a domain name and

617
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,180
some configuration parameters such

618
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,859
I think you you know what's for
well-defined

619
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,980
this configuration file

620
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,609
not so easy way in but begins this is
not

621
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:39,940
and plus 60 said it was fortunate to
exist rabbit in the sea

622
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,210
because there are no Israel in general
if me

623
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,300
stated Uriel and only change
continuously

624
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,390
got to in front but

625
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,270
this attack walks and receive some data
from in front

626
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,550
saw I think means that I

627
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,980
safety or time to lunch and now we can

628
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,980
ask me any questions thank you

629
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:38,810
now right I think I missed something

630
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,280
what

631
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,830
Andrew ask me what way to

632
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,190
policy for data from cosby in Vista
attack techniques

633
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,240
because you can only for chip make it
and you have no

634
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,860
way to receive memcached keys you can
know

635
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,050
way to get to data from guest I think

636
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:08,120
on I think not so clearly

637
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,420
because my attic of principles

638
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,640
filth in case of memcached there's no
way to do this

639
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,100
if I know but at this case

640
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,290
and you can change in memcached server
to

641
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,190
I wouldn't know sequels server which
used to be

642
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,200
and in this case I can use em

643
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,020
special Commons in this no

644
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,380
sequel eyesore such as courageous

645
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,240
from couch to be in the other service
and

646
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,700
with sometimes in this logic you can
find

647
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,630
common I like been like like cummick to

648
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,310
external data and other and you must
exploit houses

649
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,820
as blame sublime by

650
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,280
techniques there's no way even using
time in

651
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,710
you can you have no weights to read data
in memcached

652
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,410
by this but in there real security
audits

653
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,740
now when we know application and

654
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,750
North something about my guest former

655
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,020
this way only for injection sessions

656
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,650
began exact on administration's
administration

657
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,680
session is great privileges in them cash
to using

658
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,640
respective and the then check this
session from

659
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,010
across from front-ends it's not only a

660
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:33,030
not only one way if I think but for

661
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,640
in case of an impressive I think I have
no ways to

662
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,360
get data and

663
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,630
in your last example with the young
dicks you used to webmaster tools site

664
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,550
and and by setting the a records to the
internal

665
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,570
I P and the device

666
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,609
tools would connect to the internal

667
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,940
internal IP address why would

668
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,359
day I'll their internal final allowed
his connection at all

669
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:09,800
i think you must

670
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,050
ask young dicks guys misrepresented in
this whole

671
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,170
about this its

672
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:23,170
sounds to me like a poorly designed
firewall there in really I have no way

673
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,640
to answer your something

674
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,730
it's a black box for me and the

675
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,059
I only tried to do something costing

676
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,339
and check if it's rock on Hanover's to

677
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,730
validate many parables rules another
because

678
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,800
hell naw sister spirals any other
questions from the floor

679
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,130
i think im really talk

680
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,970
I have a question about YouTube
reflections that you mention it earlier

681
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,450
on is there a way in to due to network
reconnaissance

682
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,599
to scan the network without knowing if

683
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,819
services actually on the tape import
because

684
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:09,280
on on %um

685
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,730
yeah here you must know their cosby AP
address and

686
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,829
the fact that memcached runs their mom

687
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:21,369
and is it possible to the do some
reconnaissance

688
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,640
the reflection reads impossible i think
you must

689
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,210
ask me about forge biggest to

690
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,430
looked like interface known

691
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,829
arm when you reflect back its you never
gets

692
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:41,099
any mmm information about

693
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:45,220
if the the service was actually there so

694
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:52,220
do have any means to find that out I
think you said that's

695
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,619
you have no I didn't know ways to force
memcached to

696
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,089
being your back for you to know

697
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:10,030
soul the techniques that your room you
did not disclose for

698
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,640
other no school mom databases

699
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,369
should be applicable here too B&Q back
to

700
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:20,430
for you to know that this service is
actually there yes for

701
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,480
mentor scans yeah I or the

702
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,670
talked about me no single database which
have

703
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,799
pingback: waste of tax is about

704
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:33,869
in memcached memcached have a simple
syntax

705
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:37,790
for comment jet comments and South
Commons

706
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,069
other simple common such as vision
states and

707
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:46,200
have no ways to great in bigger pics &
and maybe I I think Victor maybe

708
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,589
and based on and exchange data

709
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:53,940
from it and guest be to make your stay
and

710
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,990
maybe you can on you can crater is very
difficult

711
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:02,040
and the use is this infinite loops to
iterate

712
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,069
data from cosby but its looks likes
heart to

713
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,380
cut to create this exploit

714
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,079
and a I can to confer on spear

715
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,849
now but its look like possible anyway
and the second question

716
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:21,160
I bought the clan certificates his head

717
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,030
on even if there is a and you glean

718
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,400
HCPs website which

719
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,900
does not require cleanser get you can
modified

720
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,290
you are in your clients to send their

721
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,420
client certificate in the server room
will yes he'll yeah

722
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,690
is the common behavior or can you

723
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,360
did disclose any information it's really
common the and

724
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,680
I sort by that and

725
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,740
the last question is about the Uriel
scheme us

726
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,480
material out in

727
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,670
certificates now

728
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,710
recover the clan certificates are

729
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:05,040
other in a part of powerful schema such
laws such as golfer

730
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,770
like defense implementation but

731
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,700
I think that you next also

732
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,000
use it lead Curiel fourth all those
great thank you

733
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,740
yeah thank you any other questions from
the floor

734
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,770
no

735
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:30,910
if you have further questions let
America be around truck the conference

736
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,870
dis two days

737
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,550
keys to free to approach him if you have
anything further

738
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,740
thank you very much that it merits join
me thank you
