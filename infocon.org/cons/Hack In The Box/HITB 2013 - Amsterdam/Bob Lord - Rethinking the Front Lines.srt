1
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,920
you

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,619
thank you so how many of you are all
night rather than just up early as

3
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,200
anybody

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,369
that I C one one hand to hand so if you
feel how how really for people are

5
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,950
and you're still hacking away thank you
so much what's up

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,750
it's an incredible honor to be here
speaking to you it's actually an honor

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,970
to be here at the conference

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,440
and this is my first jack in the box and
a already have met several people who

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,360
might new

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,879
online and I didn't I've never met them
in person before so

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,519
a particular there was a one individual
who had submitted

12
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,960
ha security vulnerabilities to Twitter
and we worked with and a couple years

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,449
ago

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,470
time since then so it's it's been
fantastic I'll

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,670
so you know this is a keynote and so I
think part of what I want to do is

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,840
is %uh talk about some fairly lofty
ideals

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,570
and I also a practical person so gonna
talk about some these lofty ideals

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,200
and then I'm gonna try to tie goes back
to some things that we're doing

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,650
asked Twitter so you can see a little
bit above

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,130
5y why I'm thinking about certain facts
so

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,440
but I love this is rethinking the front
lines but really there are so many

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,689
different ways person to to think about
this

23
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,719
up it could be that were attacking the
enterprise

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,770
I could be that we're doing using social
engineering tools to

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,469
affect the company culture on and of
course

26
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:42,700
I'll talk a little bit more about why
this is fun so one of the things

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,219
that you should always do know what
about the shit never do

28
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,259
I was get those confused is tell a joke
at the beginning so

29
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,079
I'm gonna tell you which only the
beginning but I'm going to warn you this

30
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,509
is not a funny joke

31
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:58,170
Tom you've probably heard it before and
I actually don't think that funny but I

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,200
do think that it's

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,700
the sort of thing that %uh I think about
a regular basis because I see evidence

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,670
love this almost on a on a daily basis
so

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,930
there's the joke a police officer is
walking his beat

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,080
and he season man underneath the street
light

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,500
and the man is looking around things
looking around in the CAF watches this

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,580
for a few minutes

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,310
and then he's a hey buddy what is it
that you're doing it

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,210
men's as well I lost my keys I can't
find them

41
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,390
and the police officer says lol and

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,580
so they both start looking around with a
streetlight

43
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,790
network around and look around and then

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,830
filing a police officer says so but are
you sure that you lost your keys here

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,989
menses no I don't know I think I lost in
the park and the police are successful

46
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,269
what are we doing looking around here
and nasa's all the lights better

47
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:59,250
at its the jobs problem it's gonna be
like 100 years old is he wants to do

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,450
some research and find out how old it is

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,939
let me know but its it's a charcoal

50
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:10,349
but I think for me it's something that I
see in this industry a great deal

51
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,530
what I see is that we spend a lot of
time

52
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,689
looking where the light is better rather
than where the problems are

53
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,920
and what I said I think that's human
nature when this industry thing we spent

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,760
a lot of time talking about tools

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,689
we spent a lot of time talking about
technologies should I buy

56
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:33,150
this ideas should I use this open source
tool these are the things that get us

57
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,930
hired

58
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,549
these are the things that are bosses
greatness in terms our performance on

59
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,700
and so it's very natural that we think a
lot about tools

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,150
so opt-outs human nature

61
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,030
bought up but I guess the question is is
that really

62
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,340
where the light is the pastor is that
where the problem is.

63
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,780
so what I when I take a look at the
headlines of course when I talk about

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,579
headlines of course we might wear

65
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,480
news feed I see a lot of science so what
I see

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,610
are a lot of up a lot of

67
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,379
up glamour syntax licensing stuff I have
to happen to do with

68
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,730
the CTA's I happened to see a lot of
references to

69
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,079
jobs early days but what I think

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,239
sometimes get no to and I suspect you do
also

71
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,470
is this stream my love

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,910
news reports those lost laptops that
have

73
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,310
a company ID is on and I have social
security numbers on a half credit card

74
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,020
numbers on

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,480
and I see this stream it has to somehow
get tired out to somebody using a

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,690
password

77
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,700
or employees re using a password

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,130
and I think we tend to focus on these
classes tax because their glamorous

79
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,840
that's where the nature flower

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,400
and we sorted block out of our
consciousness

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,570
these I these reports of these very
Monday morning sex because we know

82
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,670
you're supposed to encrypt your laptop

83
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:03,150
with Duff we show that you're supposed
to use could pass for its of course

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,390
so that's not interesting these 0 days
are much more interesting

85
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,520
so that's what we remember and I think
that we think about

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,180
employees and the people who work in in
enterprises

87
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,450
I think that we're just I think that
we've just given up on a

88
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,100
and I think that you've probably given
up on a

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,710
and you may have given up on it
implicitly in other words the they just

90
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,910
may be fading with your consciousness

91
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,640
or possibly it's the case that who have
said

92
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,550
she'll never without it's just a little
act right

93
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,220
don't even try and so when I started
thinking about things that up

94
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,750
we were doing that I want to talk about
here I started to look around

95
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,930
raised my consciousness and I didn't
really know there is a debate going on

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,640
on it turns out there is a big debate
going on and so there was a prisoner

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,060
article

98
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,910
%uh never weeks ago and he talks about

99
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,180
employees security awareness training
and he basically doesn't have a lot of

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,780
nice things to say about but

101
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,080
he is very thoughtful in his his
critique

102
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,610
and when I think he does on a regular
basis that I find helpful

103
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,160
as he looks at these things from our
perspective so he doesn't just look at

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,130
from our community perspective he tries
to get analogies from other areas

105
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,530
and in this article talks about things
like exercise

106
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,260
we know it takes to be a to be healthy
were supposed to

107
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,270
%uh resposta exercised when people are
trained to do this

108
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,840
they just usually does and so that's
where the failure of training he talks

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,480
about

110
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,150
terms a thigh injury prevention that's
an area where is as we've had some

111
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,280
successes

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,250
up but the conditions in the structure
the training is just differ

113
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,100
we also he talks a little bit about
Picasa training people to learn to drive

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,210
it's a very targeted sort of thing I of
course

115
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,540
washing hands which is something that
helps spread

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,050
her to stop the spread love disease up

117
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,180
so you know here some to resolve things
to say David tell us what we're blunt

118
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,490
in his critique go security awareness
training %uh and basically concludes

119
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,770
that it just doesn't work

120
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,970
his I think German very good idea which
is that

121
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,210
we'll have limited limited number of
hours in the day

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,620
number of people in our organization at
dollars to spend and those

123
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,770
and those resources our best bet in
other areas

124
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,080
where we can actually better make
improvements others also with today to

125
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,700
the NRC conference

126
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,570
are where people were talking about
police security awareness training

127
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,700
and on the one hand we're all the people
who said that

128
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,940
didn't work and undecided on another

129
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,630
apparently was no way and so I think
it's very unfashionable to say

130
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,840
that you might be able to do something
around security awareness training

131
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,590
and I think parlay I think that has to
do with the Eagles I think people may

132
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,500
have tried

133
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,360
and it hasn't succeeded and overtime
they develop this of course is that too

134
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,090
I'll and I think unfortunately what's
going on here is a little like the

135
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,420
machinations a

136
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,110
and I'll talk about a look at some other
things that we're doing in-house

137
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,420
up along that line

138
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,070
so as I was thinking about this I was
thinking what what is security

139
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,130
awareness training is one of those
things that you have to go to once a

140
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,980
year where somebody who is the security
professional

141
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,560
is telling you how to choose a good pass
for its whatever that might mean

142
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,459
on is one of those things where a
security guy gets off he's really scary

143
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,339
and it just basically scares you for an
hour once a year

144
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,630
but you're not sure whether his action
always positive because that's what

145
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,750
we're talking about

146
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,830
and yeah of course that would never work
I don't think anyone ever things at work

147
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,279
but it's actually not extreme examples
just means I'll I friend two weeks ago

148
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,620
came to me and said of I just had a
security awareness training session my

149
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,570
company

150
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,569
I settled tell me about that he said
they taught us how to pick the passwords

151
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,790
I said this is great tell me what they
said

152
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,829
he said welp stuff what

153
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:08,410
take a dictionary word

154
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,480
and I said yeah this and he said

155
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,939
but that's not awful Harris so you have
to do something

156
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:20,089
said it's gonna be good he said

157
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,439
you take the letter aidid

158
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,970
to replace it sign

159
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,189
but you don't stop there there's a
letter L

160
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:38,189
you replace it with the number 12 in the
hackers will never figure this out

161
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,730
so yeah and of course is this guy has
ever copper I still say I did everything

162
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,730
they told me in the training class

163
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,120
%uh so yeah if that security awareness
training I think we can agree that

164
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,310
that's not a good day

165
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,000
people are gonna learn from that if they
didn't learn from it they learned author

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,779
of facts

167
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:59,709
so that's what we're talking about
that's not a good day so

168
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,500
what really know the goals that we're
talking about here up

169
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,589
I think that the goal isn't to talk
about security awareness training

170
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,760
up and try to hold at some level of
perfection

171
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,779
there's this thing and debates the
everybody else either

172
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,089
number of other number of other ways to
talk about that and basically

173
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:23,380
DL up the idea is that if an idea a
solution to a problem

174
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,610
isn't perfect tits %uh no value at all

175
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,260
and i think is computer professionals
and security professionals in particular

176
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,639
we love the idea of perfection we love
saying i cant proof

177
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,399
I can prove that know it's gonna be able
to take recess until after the heat of

178
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,279
the universe

179
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
and we're very attracted to this level
of perfection

180
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,110
and so we I think like to think that
we're hearing from these words a

181
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,449
these reasoning fallacies in fact I
think

182
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,870
were more susceptible because we
actually do have places

183
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,069
where there is perfection and we assume
that everything else

184
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:01,880
can be held that's a level of perfection
so I wanna talk about us

185
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,389
this nirvana I love making a bulletproof

186
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,490
amazing and so that a single person is
it going to be

187
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,910
attacked I in the enterprise that still
going to have to

188
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,440
out but I'm talking shifting the balance
and making sure that we're making these

189
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,290
little changes

190
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,370
because the little changes can really
add up going back to

191
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,399
stars analogy about being healthy you
know

192
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,850
if you dig if you serve you to be
careful about moving

193
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,440
trying to analyze and peace out these
metaphors a bit too much

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,350
but there is research that says if your
friends

195
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,889
eat right and if they exercise

196
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:42,089
you're more likely to do the same day
and if your friends

197
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,699
don't exercise and if they do anything
right you're more likely to do that

198
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,100
unfortunately the research also suggests
that it's easier to go down a dark path

199
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,069
that is the

200
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:54,390
path eating right up but there's
something about how it's

201
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,100
you know how to the things that we do
one run on autopilot

202
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,140
and were smart people so we like to
think that we are very

203
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,050
purposeful and that are prefrontal
cortex really controls

204
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,529
follow what we do it turns out it really
controls very little we do

205
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,390
most of who we are is what we do one run
on autopilot

206
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,839
it's time that we do what we're not
thinking ovitz was Laura severe brain

207
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,839
and so precision are also i will
definitely read article

208
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,970
and he says something very interesting

209
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,920
he says that and if the security
engineers for your job right

210
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,689
and use will get their awareness
training informally and we can't wait

211
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:40,350
from their colleagues and friends and so
that I think exactly right

212
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,899
it's who you hang out with and what
those cultures are all about

213
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,399
that helps giant what you're going to do

214
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,170
when you're faced certain kinds of
attacks I was even see where I'm going

215
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,430
with all of this

216
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,649
is a strong arm but I think to talk
about security awareness training

217
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:00,610
being in perfect in there for now
working I'll

218
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,569
especially if you're just talking about
people hi in sort of classes that my

219
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:05,360
friend was in

220
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,510
so I want to know how can we make the

221
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,269
the the culture within our organization
and the organizations where

222
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:18,029
you know I talk to friends however
remains at happening they're doing

223
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,350
things to secure way

224
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,649
the default wat you do thanks when
you're on autopilot when you're not

225
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:23,740
thinking about

226
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,220
security per se you just doing it
because that's the way we do thanks

227
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,860
up and I want with us into a cultural
security

228
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,040
Sonata training security but a culture

229
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,949
of security so

230
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,630
a little bit about about Twitter and
some of you may have read this the the

231
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,550
few articles on this

232
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,880
up but there was a some concern when the
company was going to require a growth

233
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,579
that the up at some point very soon

234
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:55,010
the number of new people were
dramatically outnumber the old people

235
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,459
and so that I don't like chronologically
esmine like in terms of their 10 year

236
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,230
the company

237
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,290
so the concern was that the people who
head

238
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,480
informally bill this culture which made
a great company

239
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,130
that they would be up that you'd be
reduced and percentage-wise in terms of

240
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,149
the overall company

241
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,709
and the culture that made clear great
might just evaporate if somebody didn't

242
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,380
do something very consciously

243
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,449
to secure that and when

244
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:25,050
cultures evaporator isn't the training
for what people say oh

245
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,890
yeah that was the day it's something
that you don't notice

246
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,429
its gradual that happens over the course
of weeks months and years

247
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:35,730
there's also the issue of my cultures so
you think about us

248
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,160
the fact that we're all in one building
but at a remote offices

249
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,760
those remote offices would likely have
their own micro cultures

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,449
so what can we do to make sure that
those people were connected to the

251
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,559
original culture

252
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,630
up company how do we keep the good stuff
good

253
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,689
and sober people got together to talk
about we know

254
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,360
call me core values and they spent was
like six or nine months

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,100
trying to figure out how to to encode

256
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,170
p the things I mean Twitter great within
the organization

257
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,929
how to write those down and so came up
with a a list of ten of those included

258
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:15,000
such things as grow our business in a
way that makes a sprout

259
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,540
so that has been the kind of core value
to on a number of occasions

260
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,339
has influenced and actually helped make
decisions for how

261
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,540
we go about hi engaging in certain
projects sir

262
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,140
partnerships and it's even stop sign
because we thought that was it

263
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,439
a waiter to gross our business in a way
that makes us proud

264
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:36,380
and another one is innovator
experimentation and so there's a real

265
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,420
culture of

266
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,620
up trying to experiment measured and

267
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,829
a and then repeat so are

268
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,649
so again I i'm really thinking about
this

269
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,679
security awareness debate about security
awareness

270
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,420
by the way was awareness meeting mean
that such a such a vague term for

271
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,100
TV where something I could be aware that
I should not mean all that case last

272
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,720
night but they did

273
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,850
I shouldn't have had that extra bases
pizza but did elsewhere that helmet

274
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,949
on so you know I wanna I wanna

275
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:12,799
take this cultural ideals that we had a
quiz and Twitter

276
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:19,760
and I want to make sure that we work
like that which and the security

277
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,540
so far there was another debate going on
when I was thinking about culture

278
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,799
and it's really fun are all up by Sean

279
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,510
are in Fast Company at its its kinda 3

280
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,949
title culture strategy from much

281
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:39,100
and his basic message is a is the
following

282
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,120
cultures about split a few psychology
attitudes and actions at least a

283
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,779
combined creator play-or-pay

284
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,279
serious momentum world miserable
stagnation

285
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,510
a strong culture flourishes with us
either clear values

286
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,000
norms actively kite the way

287
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
company operates and yes several
examples of companies whose

288
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,939
Pat superstar cultures and may not have
had this

289
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,370
strikes at a %uh strategic goals

290
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,679
but they do remarkable things anyway %uh
and the smaller views

291
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:15,720
out up and watercolor bottles but
there's

292
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,000
a rear maybe call a reply fire thanked
us for our

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,240
yes really great Clark interest by the
way

294
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,059
%uh and so he concludes that up the
lesson here

295
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,570
isn't that culture it's strategy for
lunch

296
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,720
fill us in a sec culture is what allows
adult out on a successful strategy

297
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,690
still in the not cultural parts a
strategy to create

298
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,090
your day I love you adult outcall

299
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,320
thanks and it's hard to find up a number
of other opinions on

300
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,419
about her up

301
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,220
so from the from the very early stages
one when I started the security team

302
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,280
up I thought it culture was going to be
important saying this is before the

303
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,030
court values it was a it was just
something I want to do because I

304
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,330
I thought I seen this sort of thing done
well as it seems

305
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,360
security teams not really successful I
saw him off to the side

306
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,210
and so I wanted to make sure that we
were

307
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,550
the security team that up try to say yes

308
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,389
and that's not always possible as
anybody here takin stand-up comedy

309
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:28,389
classes a few late anybody like

310
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,639
stand-up comedy with a up to 2 p.m.
products to help people

311
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:34,830
okay I recommends this highly

312
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,860
II did this for the long haul I found it

313
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,169
up very challenging by afterwards I
couldn't stop thinking about

314
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:44,790
and one of the things that they teach
you one of the first things that they

315
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,020
taught us

316
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,820
was that how you doing routine were you
house yourself on stage you have

317
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,520
somebody else on state

318
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,950
and your in process you're making things
up

319
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,480
you're going to walk to occasionally
hear what the other person says and then

320
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,159
say

321
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,980
yes spot and so they say

322
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,429
never do that here's what you have to do
which you have to say is

323
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:11,540
test and that's what you have to do is
use to build on what that person has

324
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,300
artist up so that person

325
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,550
has said something ridiculous thats you
would like to discredit

326
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,700
can't do that you have to sing that
that's the truth and you're going to

327
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,679
extend

328
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,970
what they're doing and up %uh

329
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,149
and so in this particular case I think
my motto is

330
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,399
to try to say well not yes and

331
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:35,830
not yes but yes if so yes you can watch
this product

332
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,210
if we can do the security review up
front rather than after you from the

333
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:39,950
code

334
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,230
or yes if were able to make these other
changes so the data goes over here it

335
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,530
doesn't go out there

336
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,889
and so we try to be very up yes

337
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,389
if life throw out all of our engagements

338
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:55,590
up and so I think that was an element

339
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,790
love security culture that we were
trying to build

340
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,850
so we had some things that we want to

341
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,070
up to think about our thinking about
training and

342
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,730
one of them is you know when we say
training Sox

343
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,570
what exactly does that mean up is it
that it's

344
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,669
never affected that people can't learn

345
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:19,120
or maybe it's that the material sucks

346
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,450
maybe we're telling people that use
passwords and a crummy way

347
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,200
or maybe to and this is probably

348
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,110
true much the time maybe it's a trainer
that sucks it's me

349
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,730
at I think people are really willing to
think about that how are we going to

350
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,120
measure effectiveness

351
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,330
so how we were wondering like hell how
do you measure the effectiveness

352
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,610
a training program worth culture up and
as anybody really

353
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,790
measuring any of this stuff in a way
that

354
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,300
there they're free to talk about how
much can talk about for doing

355
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,370
up and I measure cultures it doesn't
make any sense for me to say my culture

356
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,669
is a 4.3 in years is a powerful

357
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,370
I don't know how to measure about the
the culture per se

358
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,960
by I think there's some good things that
we might be able to build

359
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,600
up may be able to build up can use as a
proxy

360
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,260
so we wanted to find a population to
study a population is employees

361
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,360
we wanted to determine what to stay so
we do a lot of stuff

362
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,730
with our users but we wanted keep
something

363
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,899
naturally want to build a feedback loop
so we didn't want to do things just once

364
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:26,970
and then up and call it a day

365
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:30,179
we wanted to find a place to stay and
then

366
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:34,740
studying that particular aspect overtime
and then change what we were doing

367
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,470
to approve

368
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,520
so to that population so there's just

369
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,899
likes a lot of things going on at
there's no way for us to measure

370
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:50,480
I everything all at once so I don't
wanna traded travel company or something

371
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,740
and try to

372
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,230
that's just too much so should we say
men despite

373
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,559
apartment and that's what we started
with this thinking about

374
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,360
how different departments but those are
kinda day it won't be able to charge

375
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,600
people think about remote offices versus
headquarters

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,790
maybe something else hop but in the end

377
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,940
which shows the new hires

378
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,440
up and I think for lunch in retrospect
obvious reasons

379
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,889
I'll they show up on the first day

380
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:24,710
and they have to show up in order to
teach start to get pay

381
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,840
so I know that I'll be there on the
first day I don't have it any other day

382
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,740
and so a captive audience when people
start

383
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,780
they are fishy here and

384
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,050
very impressionable at they will really

385
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,929
do what I tell them to do on a first
date and they don't do what I tell them

386
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,030
on any other day

387
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,530
especially after they get caught up in
that and the in the weeks were

388
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,149
out overtime though we come to a cross
section of the company's so any given

389
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:53,980
new hire class like to have a
disproportionate number people sales

390
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,090
marketing or legal

391
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,149
but over time it'll actually become a
reflective

392
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:01,309
a a percentage wise everything else

393
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,450
all the other is the company and we can
track to

394
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,570
for their entire career some actual
number of people

395
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,179
it's consistent we have been coming
every week and honestly if i cant

396
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,970
move the needle on people who were just
started

397
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,840
that honestly not sure what I'm going to
be in the camp that says

398
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,090
that security awareness training can
move can't do something

399
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,139
so this was really is a place where we
were stacking the deck

400
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,480
in our favor the most so

401
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,210
who should do the presentation as I said
before other places where they have

402
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,600
trainers country and security awareness
training they're not security people

403
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,419
and so I think that they have no
credibility with the people who were

404
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:40,800
there

405
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,369
their teaching had so I decided to

406
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,480
I would do following you hire
presentations I had for some time

407
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,770
I didn't really understand I think the
reasons why I have chosen to do that

408
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,860
I think David started rich because
there's somebody else to do it had tired

409
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,980
of people team

410
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,460
but now I have a very strong came I
could certainly delegate

411
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,270
file on up presenting it cuts like this
personally lead

412
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,909
each of those new higher classes I think
this tells people that if it's important

413
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,669
enough for me to personally

414
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,080
time in my schedule that should be
important for hours out to

415
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,659
to take notice and hopefully take action
because that's what we're talking about

416
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:19,860
I don't know how much the values mean
personally showing up a.m. over

417
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,419
rating it may be overthinking it but I
think it does have some value

418
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:26,840
and up I do think that sparse texts
attack

419
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,869
in my favor so as we've heard up
throughout the last

420
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,679
10 years past because we got any day now
and

421
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,730
this is also the years marker by the way
up

422
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,809
so they're gonna solve these problems
are going to be gone up and

423
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,649
wanna talk to people at other companies
I say it's up to you

424
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,260
to teach up you know what sort of things
to talk about

425
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,590
talk about how spurts on you know to you

426
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,070
pocket passer managers you values are
you make people

427
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,000
use you have any other policies and
procedures around how people treat

428
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,110
housewares

429
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,500
and they say wait what we talking about

430
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,990
to make people pay passwords ago

431
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,619
okay well in my informal trials

432
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:13,740
I have I have found that out later or

433
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,309
house for its challenging for civilians
I found out there

434
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,070
they're really challenging for for
security professionals to

435
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,250
so when I go around talking to people I
talked to people this conference talk

436
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,809
other conferences star security
professionals over a drink

437
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,990
and I don't even have to have that many
drinks and before they start telling the

438
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,690
truth

439
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,879
at and what i think is happening is that

440
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,800
we're not doing a very good job of
choosing our passwords and I'm gonna

441
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,070
burst but if I stay here is your chance
but

442
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,260
up how but you know just in your head

443
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,770
how many you adopt a policy like this
where you

444
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,840
out up you have a heart remember strain
modify or something

445
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,360
and the URL something about the name so
is your

446
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,690
password some crazy stranger visiting
our movie you play

447
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,300
our hoover with the end on and and that
have suffered

448
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,460
I have a separate low-value password for
accounts

449
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,210
out that you don't really care about
kids make you have one

450
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,500
I'll so I I really don't think he's our
best practices

451
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,700
and and like I said I've talked to
several you in this room

452
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,230
and those were your practices and I'm
hoping that as I it's I tell you that

453
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,590
these are not good practices

454
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,409
think some you hustle miles nauseous
realize yeah

455
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:32,580
you could really do better on some
people talk about things like

456
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,830
xkcd passwords to people about that mean
sexy passwords were past races we have

457
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,290
I like four randomly selected word
search for five hours

458
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:46,260
up and password after some people to use
does not serve people using

459
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,299
a flat files on a thumb drives that are
accredited

460
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:52,990
all sorts of things and but I don't
think passwords are

461
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,529
really going away as much as we're we're
trying to reduce

462
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,980
up there their presence within the
enterprise and between businesses

463
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,110
I'll and so they're they're going to be
around for a little while

464
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,929
and so you know I think using a password
manager

465
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:13,039
tends to be a much better practice for
creating and managing and using

466
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,390
credentials up and

467
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,460
we wanted to know what what our place
we're doing all we thought they were

468
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,779
doing as we told them

469
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,799
to go is this we want to be able to
measure but they're really doing

470
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,279
I think security teams like to say a
difference several people oh yeah

471
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,519
we have an employee handbook despotism

472
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,539
up password vault same great like

473
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,909
do they do that I'll how I have

474
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,679
are you no shouldn't you know to use a
Taser call in and say

475
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,460
yeah I i talked to that we talk they're
supposed to every night at

476
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,960
up as anybody I've actually never teach
these things like

477
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,299
you know we say leary is what is
complicated pieces of software

478
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,210
to good luck with all that guy and sales
ops thats

479
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,330
that's not really very helpful I'll and
honestly to me

480
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,850
I just passed a call for a joint Twitter
ed

481
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,919
I had to switch to a different one and I
didn't get a flight two weeks

482
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:12,980
I was was so frustrated I was copying
and pasting

483
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,789
veterans I was just doing it completely
wrong and once I started doing it right

484
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:22,580
up I was like buses actually much better
so I want to stay

485
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,750
our users we told your spouse for false

486
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,809
are they actually using them the other
thing I want to do is

487
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,940
is what most enterprises to which is
fiche

488
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
how many of you are in organizations
where do fishing

489
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,809
you fish the employees I'll have to be
more Estacada

490
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,029
okay a few hires liars

491
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:45,820
I'll your company's role fishing if you
have even a mid-size company I think you

492
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,360
should be doing some fishing

493
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,769
up and so here's what most most
organizations do it

494
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:55,330
%uh security team well 50 employees

495
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,809
and then no wait a while and then option
against

496
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,220
and I just hope that a numbers are
smaller and that's not bad

497
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,870
that's not the worst part I forgive me
any worse security plans

498
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,710
I'll and the overall strategy here's is
to build up antibodies

499
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,890
and what that is this the sense that

500
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,149
by spraying out somebody's these
internal fishing

501
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,179
guy emails vast I and II trainers

502
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,100
people click on a link so they enter
their credentials and they get up page

503
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,950
it says hi

504
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,149
aren't supposed to do that this was a
training exercise not tonight

505
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,880
so get is that you're building a tease
antibodies overtime people start to

506
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,059
become a little bit more

507
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:38,220
suspicious and emails book I I wanted to
do better I didn't want to just

508
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,289
details expandable a bunch of emails the
way they do it again

509
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,590
I don't want to do that I wanted to do
something %uh a little bit more

510
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,039
strategic

511
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,740
also want to cross correlation things
and over time but i wanna start doing is

512
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,820
trying to figure out what is the overall
clearest so

513
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,240
can we throw it lost assets like is
there through

514
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,779
of people earn individual who's losing
laptops on a regular basis

515
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:06,519
not using password manager or as
susceptible to phishing and other kinds

516
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,779
of factors

517
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:10,990
what are the baseline all of these up
these inputs

518
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,360
and study them over time not just
between a couple points but I wanted to

519
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,990
get

520
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:18,600
you know a whole team quarter whole two
years for issue effects

521
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,970
and up of course running multiple
phishing campaigns at a time when I

522
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,340
over I just wanted to figure out how we
could just focus on

523
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,159
one particular area which is the new
hires and make sure that we understood

524
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,909
what was happening to and I wanted to
get a feedback loop going so I didn't

525
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:34,970
wanna dispersants a

526
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,860
naughty naughty I want to engage in the
process and so our team

527
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,240
%uh came up with some mechanisms for
getting that feedback loop

528
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,820
on and hopefully this would reduce the
chances that we would be at a

529
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,450
on payout up an us versus them

530
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,950
culture and again that this is all I
have is how we make it so that people's

531
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,510
habits when they're on autopilot not
thinking

532
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,370
but they are doing the right sec so
security awareness training

533
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,850
up and getting that from their friends
and their colleagues

534
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,549
like what tupper star mentioned that was
important

535
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,980
so we want to measure and study make a
bunch of changes and their EP we want

536
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,720
this constant feedback loop

537
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,429
not training to you and good luck with
all that

538
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:23,600
we've wanted to have some sort of thing
that was up

539
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,639
repeating a regular basis so we came up
with a

540
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,630
idler mailing list so people could
report suspicious activity

541
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,200
and up whatever guys came up with this
idea and I was like I'll

542
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,409
thats pretty clever I've actually never
heard of that before

543
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,799
and so we created this fishing alert

544
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,840
and so in my new hire training I tell
them if you see a suspicious email

545
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,600
even if you're really sure it's from our
team please send it to this mailing list

546
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,679
come and we've got to a guy on the team
who is outstanding at trying to answer

547
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,720
all of them so

548
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,519
every side every single time somebody
right said he will honor them by say

549
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,960
yep that was us that was a good cash
can't fool you

550
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,010
%uh but also say %uh itself hollis

551
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,649
but suspicious email up kill tell tell
the hell disinvest occasion and told him

552
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:12,380
that too

553
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,870
sometimes the real a taxable sales think
I didn't click on that link that was

554
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,970
about their

555
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,000
I love for spam looks like an attack if
you don't really

556
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,190
%uh if you don't really know and of
course is the training

557
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,000
attacks which which Ross and so we want
them to send us feedback on all of these

558
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,639
things

559
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:34,440
because it could well be that the one
email that we get the one tip that we

560
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,389
get from somebody in the field is the
thing that causes us to start pulling

561
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,409
out a threat

562
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:42,279
to unravel something fairly have various
going on we can't be everywhere

563
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,149
and ass seemingly innocuous tip may be
very very important to us

564
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,850
so we'll against the salt for the
feedback loop

565
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,139
get thing we do is we have office hours

566
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,139
so we set up in the cafeteria

567
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:01,679
and we wait for people to come back and
sometimes

568
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,500
somebody comes by with a random topic ap
out

569
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,159
up you know whatever it is that is my
hobby or the other guys hobby

570
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,419
and sometimes they come to ask is really
dumb questions but it turns out that

571
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,840
those dumb questions really are so dumb
after all

572
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,769
um it's all about building report making
sure that they know they can come to us

573
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:22,750
no matter what

574
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,659
and we've had people come and confess
sins obstructing at the worse and that

575
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,919
we have had in a really bad sense but
people do come up on a regular basis and

576
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,639
say

577
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:36,070
you know the other day I did yes and I'm
not so sure I was suppose so

578
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,789
and so we have you know try to keep our
composure

579
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,259
and we say okay thank you for coming and
we try to work through it

580
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,509
I'll and so again making sure that
people

581
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:53,509
are feeling like there's a feedback loop
is is really critical

582
00:33:53,970 --> 00:34:00,470
so some results so want to actually talk
about the things that we were doing

583
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,610
up and give you some some insights so
again this is some thought the lofty

584
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,159
ideals

585
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,169
let me show you how we're putting
somebody's in

586
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:13,020
to practice so as I said before

587
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,220
we ask all of our employees to use a
password vault

588
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,560
and the a when we started to figure out
how to

589
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,779
really analyze this we found out that
into big surprise I just told you have

590
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,009
to be space for fall

591
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:30,919
that increase the password vault and so
we made some changes

592
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:35,270
so that in the new hire class II medical
budget changes like cut down my

593
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,409
presentation

594
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,379
and we added a section where we
basically forced everybody to install

595
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,540
the password vault

596
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,919
and two activated and then to change
their Twitter password so we knew for a

597
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:46,889
fact

598
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,759
that every single person who came into
the company had to start off by using

599
00:34:51,759 --> 00:34:55,270
the password vault and then they didn't
know their Twitter password we made them

600
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,480
change the password

601
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,089
to something you know 25 characters long
upper and lower case

602
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,020
completely machine generated so they
didn't know the password

603
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,130
which means that not use the password
vault

604
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:13,150
they had to goes for some work

605
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,470
okay so what is this

606
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,359
so in the upper left hand corner

607
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,660
we see up that whole families are
starting off

608
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,170
on their first week at a hundred percent
so underside employers are using a pass

609
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,060
for fall

610
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,290
and if you take a look at what these
lines are these lines represent

611
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:39,440
different cohorts in a chorus just class
people who all started on the same day

612
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,810
and early in the program we had

613
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,370
this or a fall of great this

614
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,410
obviously it's sort of chair if I for
public consumption

615
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,960
but the basic idea is that there were
different cohorts

616
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,109
who were using house for falls for a
while

617
00:35:57,109 --> 00:36:00,120
and some fell off some other than up

618
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,799
used for quite some time so we had very
high our compliance with our request

619
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:11,380
up and others power fell off a lot
faster

620
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,839
and so later in the program after we
made some changes to

621
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,100
by presentation in the way that we were
doing the training

622
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,380
we saw some improvement so this is a
different set of course a little later

623
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,620
in the program

624
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,100
and if I flip back and forth between
these you can see that we're

625
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,549
were pushing these bunches up a little
bit

626
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:33,190
and so I think we made some good
progress by the way to the bottom line

627
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,299
there's fifty-percent

628
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:37,440
so %uh even in the worst-case scenario

629
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,330
for ever started we still we're talking
about

630
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,290
out worse case scenario over half the
people were using strong passwords in

631
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,460
the house for fall

632
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,750
and when I talk to other people other
companies I think this is unprecedented

633
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,640
I just don't know if other companies
where they have

634
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,779
outside military where they have the
slow compliance

635
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,880
up her around this respects and you you
also have similar

636
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,900
up winds in your organization love to
hear about those because I'm sure that

637
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,900
we've chosen to the things we're doing
so that was early in the program

638
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,960
and then later in the program where we
had some successes

639
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,850
so the question is what is going on with
these folks

640
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,450
who are up we're leaving so they're
actually going into

641
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,370
there and have to change their passwords
again that changed something memorable

642
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:29,750
night is the to pass for fall I we want
to know whether any trends

643
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:35,009
that would help us understand Bernard

644
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:40,319
and this is we found here

645
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:43,630
so what we're learning here is that

646
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:50,170
the the people who were able to survive
the first maybe three weeks or so

647
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,350
if they can survive the first three or
four weeks thinking

648
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,310
get through that Dolby long-term users

649
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,440
that first few weeks is really critical
so whatever task is to figure out

650
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,520
how to get people through that

651
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,660
first few weeks remember us talking
about measuring we can get better

652
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,740
if if we don't know where the problems
are

653
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,430
cure the problem is that first few weeks
or actively taking on

654
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,950
some awesome approaches to figure out
how we can make that first few weeks old

655
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,470
geezer

656
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,600
one example is we know sending an email
out to people

657
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,109
after the new hire class and we tell
that that they have

658
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:32,529
up thanks for the class and we remind
them a few things

659
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:36,060
and up to a staff member sense that out

660
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,130
is that in fighting a set of feedback so
we're starting to build up

661
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,299
or every pore totally make it so that
the fall of rebel

662
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:48,080
I'll will be compressed

663
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,910
so not taking a look coerced taking a
look at apartments for said before

664
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:58,910
whatever first thought was to measure by
Park

665
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,529
here we find three departments

666
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:06,630
AB and C and be of the top that's also

667
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,819
certain line there that's our common
goal which is the up

668
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:12,960
average for all higher since we started
tracking all of this

669
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,490
so those are all up very very very
tightly

670
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,529
movement and then there's Department see

671
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:24,370
so what I talked about my cultures
before my cultures don't happen just

672
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,529
in the remote sales office remote
offices

673
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,450
obviously can be very susceptible to
that but there are specific departments

674
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,140
you probably have one in your head

675
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,549
right now and they're just different and
you don't know why that they're

676
00:39:36,549 --> 00:39:37,290
different

677
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,620
and try to make them not different up
but they're just

678
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,569
different and this is an example in this
is probably

679
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:48,240
caused by them going to you hire and
then immediately going back to their

680
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,069
desks

681
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:52,270
and having I'm assuming course AIII

682
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,250
believes that you don't have to do that
my suspicion is that day

683
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:00,900
the informal up information they get a
train ticket from their friends and

684
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,620
colleagues

685
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,640
which is which are talking about is
exactly what's going on here

686
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,220
and so we've been taking some time to
try to figure out if there are things we

687
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,990
could do

688
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,990
to change that to reverse that and one
of the things that we found

689
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,560
was tasked up we could help

690
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,310
by having just another class we took
some time and one other staff meetings

691
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,589
we get everybody together and after a
single meeting we saw last

692
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:29,330
uptick gonna keep repeating until we can
figure out of Parliament

693
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,500
think that's all sustained a so disc

694
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,040
every bit the store in this segment and
this information is a little

695
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,089
on for obvious reasons up declassify
stuff is a little older not necessarily

696
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:41,750
current

697
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,779
and so this information up is

698
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:49,140
is all about how are trying to pull that
up again if you can't measure it can to

699
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,210
prove it and so we didn't want to say

700
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,589
screenwriters training is a value we
want to peel back the onion layer after

701
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:55,250
layer

702
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,600
to figure out what's going up okay

703
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,279
fish K so talked about some phishing
campaigns and so

704
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:07,490
when we set up these fish campaigns the
ones that we sent to the new hires

705
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,790
soon after the star does have to do with
clicking on all suspicious link

706
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:16,000
and then entering credentials and when
we

707
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,430
do that we see how this up

708
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,029
and again this is this weird sector time
that outline

709
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:26,310
that top-line coming down we suspect

710
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,480
that as in part to you too

711
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,480
%uh some the changes that we made in the
training so I became much more explicit

712
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,839
about we were going to do and what we
expected him to do

713
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,390
up I also started to be more I'll

714
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,750
more contracts rather than just telling
them what a fishing campaigners

715
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,279
I show them fishing for spearfishing and
asked for their opinions and so

716
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:52,520
the classes became much more attractive
obviously this weird spiked over there

717
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,609
and in this is where their the

718
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:59,049
the danger of using smoothing algorithms
as they sometimes

719
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,180
stretch things in ways that make it seem
like there's something more going on are

720
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,210
sometimes they hide things that are
going on

721
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,339
in this particular case we suspect that
what was going on is during that time

722
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,450
period we have

723
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,630
a large number of people from a
particular art department being tired of

724
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,810
the same time

725
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,259
and so it may well be that there
informal

726
00:42:18,259 --> 00:42:22,279
%uh there course that the other people
out there in the department's

727
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:25,279
up we're reinforcing some of these bad
habits and so

728
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:28,990
we're still trying to understand exactly
what that meant

729
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,490
but we do know for a fact that there was
one part that was over represented

730
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,750
up during that up during that time
period

731
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:42,750
something that part is just more risky

732
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:47,250
so we take the raw numbers so who
clicked on the links

733
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,339
if you take a look at that top graph
that top graph shows

734
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,220
30 people %uh Department a in apartment
B

735
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,470
clicking on the links had a
disproportionate power

736
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,770
well care to all those other departments
up

737
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,069
but then if you normalize based on the
percentages of those departments those

738
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,480
departments were actually

739
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,140
up mid- to large-size organization so
even though the new hires coming in

740
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,680
work looking at a rate that was
disproportionate with other people in

741
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,750
the class

742
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,830
if you take a look at it normalized with
the Department sizes

743
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,080
you can see they were not necessarily
the worst

744
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,779
here in this particular task %uh maybe
with FPG

745
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:29,839
and so that helps us understand and I
think looking at both of those

746
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,890
ways representing the data is
interesting both raw numbers as well as

747
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,890
Carlos for Department size

748
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,319
so each tolls a little different story
so again there's a difference between

749
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:40,319
the date

750
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,180
and story and in terms of people who

751
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,630
typed in their credentials here again we
see in the raw numbers for Sizzix

752
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,950
about the department size numbers that
are normalized

753
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,140
and here we're seeing that maybe there
isn't such a big difference maybe

754
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,220
up the people in these departments
really are

755
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,430
up a little bit more risky

756
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,230
so there's also will showcase up

757
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,440
we start looking at information a couple
different ways and one other things that

758
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,569
we found was that there's

759
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,690
gender differences there since early
March gender differences

760
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,400
up between the raids which men and women
click on links

761
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,599
but what's interesting is that they up
click

762
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,890
always a little bit more but what
happens is if you click on the link

763
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,150
you were gender doesn't seem to matter
for how you will

764
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,290
I'll a a whether or not you will then
enter your crash kills

765
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,839
so they enter credentials almost exactly
the same rate and we didn't really

766
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,010
expect this week

767
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,720
I try to figure out if there was some
other factor going on baby was that

768
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,140
certain departments have

769
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,339
more women than men or something like
that but it really just looks like a

770
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:47,700
gender difference so

771
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,220
I'll you know that's the data I dot
story I want told nixon so that data

772
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,710
but that is up something that we talked
all that surprising

773
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:59,730
so much left the back alias and up

774
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,280
against moving lines can be very
dangerous especially if there's one very

775
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,630
big yellow wire

776
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:08,760
of so you could tell two stories from
this one is that

777
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,460
to like this basically as the
exponential outgrowth

778
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,589
and they've got a big ball in the middle
is up or we started doing really well

779
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,640
for a while

780
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,030
and then something I than maybe I sucked
in and out

781
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:26,300
that purple weeks I was just terrible so
I don't know what story you can tell

782
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,099
the basic overall trend is we're getting
more feedback from people and we're

783
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,740
encouraging them to send

784
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,010
information to us so that we actually
see what's going on

785
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,400
and up it like I said we track all the
different kinds of you fact that we get

786
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,800
so that we can measure that's well

787
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,890
so up so we

788
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,240
we've all the training all this week to
week and

789
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,050
up we were we first started telling
people that they had

790
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,130
is the password all we went to a model
in which we work with them

791
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,609
to change their passwords and use the
password manager

792
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:07,050
and the people who did stick with
attended to love it

793
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:10,089
up I start to get much more en route to
with the

794
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:13,220
with the people and talk more about

795
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,200
social engineering attacks fishing so
that they were a little bit more

796
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,790
are in the loop it was just me talking
to that

797
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,770
I mean much more interactive and then I
gotta love it there on its merits a lot

798
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,970
of things I do is

799
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,210
people or often coming to class and
they've just got their laptops

800
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:33,240
sitting there a check in the mail for
the first time in areas male

801
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,540
creditors always re-telling what's going
on

802
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,130
and I'm anything close to what top sites
to do that here

803
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,059
went first ball up but did you make it
was a lot of strain to wait until the

804
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,260
very last person close the laptop

805
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,440
and so I through a little bit us up are
theatrics into it

806
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,859
just so that I guarantee that I have
your attention

807
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:58,300
at that there's nothing I like this
track to and the entire session takes 45

808
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,960
minutes when people say that this

809
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,450
you know that employ security awareness
training is expensive

810
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,609
perhaps but forty-five minutes is not
that big dick

811
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:11,089
expenditure trying to crunch the numbers
get that does take some time

812
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:14,079
thought to it I can see how we're going
to be more effective if we're not able

813
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,099
to measure

814
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:20,309
the results so we wanted to think about
more things we could do

815
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:24,480
are in the future

816
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,040
one other thing is a a clear spot so
when

817
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,839
you talk to friends rated and maybe the
stand-up comedy

818
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,839
aunt Phil sometimes say while

819
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:40,079
that crops dead night and there's same
song same joe said last night

820
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,059
and they loved it so for us one of the
things we notices

821
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:47,800
up there are certain certain parts where
there's a built-in Joe

822
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,900
in and what's going on and sometimes
they laugh and sometimes they don't last

823
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,599
so

824
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:55,910
wanna thanks for thinking about his
measuring up late response like was this

825
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:57,900
a good crowd this is not a good crowd

826
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,380
these the server folks were gonna keep
moving forward with things we talked or

827
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,579
are they not

828
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:08,470
I think we're leaving up up out whatever
got sucked and Taylor

829
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:14,609
did a up really great social engineering
video also shows video clips from movies

830
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:17,480
where people are using social
engineering techniques like you know

831
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,900
hackers are stickers

832
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,750
and so it's really great %uh Hollywood s

833
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:26,260
fewer social engineering so that we can
get people thinking about

834
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,450
what it looks like how do we measure the
effectiveness that

835
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,859
like tell people take a test to a

836
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:36,080
about that on but i wanna I wanna I
wanna figure out

837
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,690
how we help coming up and in terms of
communication

838
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:44,260
how can we I how can we make this more
fun so how can we make

839
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,720
it so that people get security points
for

840
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,720
doing certain insects up with this one

841
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,170
program up which we had another previous
buildings call

842
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:59,619
I was a social engineering sector and so
there was a person who we selected

843
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:04,099
everyone to be the following is a person
a gift card for coffee shop nearby

844
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:08,470
and that person's goal was to not wear
their bad shape

845
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:13,040
and see who would catch that and so
people would walk up to me it's a

846
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,010
if they saw you with all your best Saru
the mall and if you want to avoid seance

847
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,950
are exposed and iPad iPad

848
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,940
but they were the mall head over there
the gift card and so that was quick game

849
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,540
flying

850
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,460
up the physical security aspect so what
can we do around

851
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,619
game applying the electronic security
aspects that people feel

852
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:35,099
much more like it's a %uh something that
they want to keep building up

853
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:40,270
I'll other teams and other companies I
know they sent out personal and team

854
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,950
security scores

855
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,580
maybe that's winning the fight I'll I
don't think it's exactly what I was

856
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,760
looking for but it's

857
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,930
it's something that we're up they were
starting to think a lot about

858
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,109
so what would happen if you got an email
once a month what's important said

859
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:55,119
here's our scores

860
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,260
risk profile compared to all the other
people in the company

861
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,000
without change the overall culture
security

862
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,540
and bills up in some things that

863
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,099
may be very difficult cop like coming
here is the person has been in the

864
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:10,859
industry

865
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,520
it's not a factor how secure they are
was their first language maybe

866
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,020
if English is not their first language
maybe there's something else that we can

867
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,010
do to help

868
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:25,849
and there any other cultural differences
too so

869
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:30,030
trucks lessons what things that I think
ho might have done a little bit better

870
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,490
track exactly what I was changing in the
new hire class

871
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:37,280
I mean changes almost every single week
which made the HR people are crazy

872
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,660
because I had to use my laptop instead
of using

873
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,800
their laptop of presentations on at
half-time cable and battery cable

874
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,349
as with many changes on a regular basis
to be part of the feedback loop

875
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:51,530
up but as it tracked as well so it could
well be that some other changes that we

876
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,210
saw there were the results either

877
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,220
things I did better in the presentations
are things that I didn't do as well

878
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,589
out and I think we learnt feel a lot
more careful love

879
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:05,450
house the difference between the data in
the stories we tell about the day it's

880
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,930
very easy to help one story about the
data

881
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:11,770
that is not the right story in fact it's
completely rock

882
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,780
and one of those other the grass where
should you about it

883
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,780
the fishing feedback we have just that
dates where

884
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,690
I think that you can tell two completely
different stories based on that data

885
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,619
I i think we were surprised number of
cases and very

886
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,790
very confused out i think thats

887
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,990
a healthy part just getting more
information up

888
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:37,780
and you know we work computer people
aware of and our comfort zone is often

889
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,160
typing rather talking and I think that

890
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,650
we were in retrospect using up

891
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,930
certain skills right social engineering
have and pen testing

892
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,490
not for the purpose is a pretty it but
for helping

893
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:57,589
think about culture and thinking about
reading this so we had some successes

894
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:00,760
and we had a a whole lot of questions

895
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,810
up but basically I think we were
successful in thinking about building a

896
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:06,359
culture security and not

897
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:10,320
security awareness training and building
up feedback loop

898
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,520
so measuring making changes on a regular
basis

899
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,550
repeating we really found it to be
highly successful

900
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:22,290
an amazing I think I would up leave you
with one of two things

901
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,330
is that you shouldn't give up

902
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,770
on these employees are other people that
you need to influence

903
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:33,140
if you do give up on them it is a lost
cause but its only loss cause

904
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,420
when you believe that it is a lost cause
and you believe that there's still

905
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,849
something else that you can do to make
things better

906
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:43,609
I believe that's actually true and of
course the most important thing his

907
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:47,530
to look for the props where they are not
just where the light is

908
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,609
so without I can take any questions they
may have

909
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:56,970
yes a microphone being passed around

910
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:00,780
it about this is a question

911
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,560
Twitter was watching almost read tweets
your Perry's comments

912
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,610
for casper polls bistro slow

913
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,670
his multi-device to any suggestions ur
thought

914
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:14,360
management test results across the
midwest yes so %uh

915
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,950
there or different passwords also allow
you to sync

916
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,620
on you have complications when you say
so you're putting

917
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,510
the information either over the wire up
between

918
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:29,780
between two devices for you're sending
them over the clout so some other

919
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,670
I like to sing through Dropbox throws
things up

920
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,420
other ones surely cloud-based so you
know ask about what you're getting

921
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,360
yourself into

922
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,410
up by company things like lower house
all of the implications of putting

923
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:42,890
things

924
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,160
on the clout had to up so

925
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,180
your initial password is probably
critical to that the password that you

926
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,780
use to protect your password vault

927
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,140
is critical actually going to his we
started to

928
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,190
up pass out little fortune cookies to
people in our class

929
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:02,860
and they have pre-printed xkcd style

930
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,860
password past freezes and we just
telling their inspiration so you don't

931
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,620
have to use

932
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:10,000
you know pick two or three don't have to
use any other ones that we randomly

933
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,960
generated for you

934
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,580
you can pick either once but the search
inspiration for you to think about

935
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:19,330
created three strikeouts and

936
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:23,630
just or good morning

937
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,710
I really like your talk %uh

938
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:30,420
has a question about the the 10 years of
arms

939
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,140
extremely intriguing the fishing mailing
list

940
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,610
I really liked us and I think it will
work

941
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,290
if and you could stand

942
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,810
be used to work to the

943
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,050
archer oleandrin the reports

944
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,900
his sadness and somehow minimized and
effective

945
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,040
so how are you going to bed yet so

946
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,440
so it's a very good question is what's
while they worry about all of which is

947
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,770
that I want people

948
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,450
up you know we need to get better
automation around the phishing campaigns

949
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:10,040
and so up guys working on that is has
made great strides health on a mission

950
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,910
of sending them

951
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:15,710
but you're absolutely right it's a
labor-intensive up process right now

952
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,910
that's probably not ask a little as I
would like to do so then the question is

953
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,670
how can I

954
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,400
automate some of that and I would love
to hear

955
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,370
up ya there may be people here in the
audience it's all that kind of problem

956
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,530
the past but

957
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:33,450
don't have an easy answer for you could
well be that artists are thinking out

958
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:33,870
loud

959
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,880
I can imagine a scenario in which we
have people go to a website

960
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,710
I'll and copy and paste the information
and

961
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,990
and it doesn't sort of analysis and up
based on

962
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,730
other previous examples as possible than
the system could

963
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:52,150
to alert them I'm not really sure how to
go about doing that automation is

964
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,810
something that we think a lot about

965
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:59,180
up for Twitter that service request
think I'm

966
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,370
after the recent coverage tweeters it
will be implemented

967
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:08,290
two-factor authentication when will that
be implemented and what type of system

968
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,150
movie

969
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:12,200
okay what time is it so it's to okay
rates was

970
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,240
57 minutes and space station first
effect rest

971
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,990
are lots of I I don't have anything to
announce

972
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,720
today miss

973
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,720
funds

974
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:40,050
Yahoo thank you per station

975
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,060
and I'm interesting about mister
measurement techniques he uses

976
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,460
return wilbur's fishing and to use also

977
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:52,580
other kinds of measurement techniques to
yet to the word on the recent you could

978
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:56,560
could see which kind of departments a
are maybe year

979
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,480
a risky %uh so for example this

980
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,280
for example sniffing for example if you
if you sleep last words words associates

981
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,640
or

982
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,710
I'll so up we

983
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,380
are measuring a boat missing some other
things I don't wanna

984
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,520
go to the doctors and so this is the
limit of what I'm really prepared

985
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,880
to talk about America's Mustangs up to
and we do want to measure more

986
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,850
up but really the whole point here was
up

987
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,870
rather your processor have all the
things that we're doing to really focus

988
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,810
on us positive feedback loop

989
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,320
I love I love turning what we consider

990
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,960
security awareness training into a
culture security doling out feedback

991
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,770
loops or not

992
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:41,290
for a slowing people arrest for some
other kinds of things okay

993
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:48,290
pointers to aren't what information you
bring it bring yourself to use your own

994
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,410
discretion

995
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:54,650
gumpaste which technology worries and no

996
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:58,380
information I'm usually use information
does

997
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,500
could be non-singing sites Twitter boss
so

998
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,180
so that you know the construction of how
we are two sides to which campaigns and

999
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:06,800
so we have

1000
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,160
a number of different campaigns up
something

1001
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,870
I'll they tend to look more like Spears

1002
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,930
campaign so back to go into the details
of it certainly don't want to learn all

1003
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:17,700
the people who were

1004
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,310
for joining this week you know what's
coming but a pair of the spear phishing

1005
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,040
category

1006
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,640
at so they're not other Nigerian Prince

1007
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,740
categories there are things that up

1008
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,700
are conceivable that up you know the
right on the edge of

1009
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,880
what you know I think a good fishing
camp a good spearfishing

1010
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,870
%uh internal campaign is one that has
many elements of something that would

1011
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,350
obscure to only be available on the
inside

1012
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:50,310
but it factor for publicly available I
have two questions

1013
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:54,210
pay the best one one makes forget when

1014
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:59,660
ASO you you have made measurements on
how many people actually job of

1015
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,870
using it has been saved password Volvo
FH and I was wondering how you actually

1016
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:04,410
track

1017
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:07,470
just mad because that's something we
have a problem with the spot brightest

1018
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:08,670
person can't say

1019
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,830
yes actually I'm not using it anymore
because its crash

1020
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:17,210
as they know that we actually went his
so that's how we go about trying to

1021
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,230
assert

1022
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,410
right how dirty guy its making sure that
you're not be I

1023
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,540
yet I'll yeah I can reveal my secret
sauce

1024
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,950
we can talk about

1025
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:34,900
and segments names at and when he did
that actually a lot but I like doing

1026
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,090
requirements away you now grab the bus
goes

1027
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,710
kinda 17 and I for it for the company

1028
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,830
tries to pick up you know if he's B
thumb drives that didn't end up in a

1029
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:45,730
safe flight

1030
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,940
you know the wink today effect I am

1031
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:53,330
and the problems I'm seeing with that is
not not so much finding stuff with

1032
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:54,610
finding that stuff which

1033
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:59,110
which is good sector checking ask but
how do you react to such things so

1034
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:02,220
what what would you do a few

1035
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:05,530
would gain knowledge about us one of the
team members

1036
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:09,060
obviously going against the policies
that you set

1037
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,630
times so just around from policies and

1038
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:16,270
out up for cultural elements around

1039
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,270
non-compliance yet so up we do

1040
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:23,080
policies and procedures but for means a

1041
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,780
the thing that i i stress most is that I
want this to be

1042
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,190
something that people do by default and
so yes

1043
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:34,440
if there were if there were some sort
incident and we found out the person had

1044
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,950
not been following policies procedures
yes there will be some consequence for

1045
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,660
that but I don't want to get that far I
what up

1046
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,070
hollow love what I'm trying to to
describe here is this

1047
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,340
this mental mindset that it is possible

1048
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:51,470
and desirable to focus on those habits
the things that people do without

1049
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,140
thinking

1050
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,700
aunt not to focus on the character

1051
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:00,550
and not stick and I think its very easy
and effortless and many other companies

1052
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,930
for people to say

1053
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,050
well as in our handbook and if they if
we find out they're doing I was just

1054
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:05,730
fired

1055
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:10,020
I just don't I just don't think that
that's culturally for a way to go about

1056
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,630
things

1057
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,260
and almost any company %uh I think doing
things because it's either the right

1058
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,060
thing for

1059
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,050
our customers or because it's it's what
everyone does

1060
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:23,860
and it happens to be the secure think
that's what I I really want to focus on

1061
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,290
so yeah there are potentially other
consequences but

1062
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,810
up my mind is just purely on a trying to
bills positive feedback

1063
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,740
so people chess do things SecureCRT

1064
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:42,870
up we have time for one last question
asked questions anyone

1065
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:49,870
from all

1066
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,230
excellent presentation on I

1067
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:01,180
actually like the the charred he should
measuring the department's

1068
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,980
complains rating 1 i was just curious if
you utilize charts

1069
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:09,579
internally presented them to the
different departments and

1070
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:13,009
defense improved the the range so

1071
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:16,170
so we're trying to figure out exactly
how to present them in a way that's

1072
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,930
going to be digested so I don't wanna
just present the weekend

1073
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,190
awareness is it my all its its changing
behavior changing actions

1074
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,930
and so that's part of the conversation
that we're doing out so

1075
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,950
yeah circulated some other stuff to
sleepies really

1076
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,960
Paulo how do we change the

1077
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,809
see and to employees behavior over time

1078
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:40,069
and it's not clear to me that just
showing them Stace

1079
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:44,009
thing that gets them going of I walk out
to not

1080
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:47,160
just be right I could think it's and
everybody their scores

1081
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,779
night right I know you're not doing
things well are you are doing things

1082
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:53,650
that for me not interesting

1083
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,589
I don't wanna be right wanna be
effective and so I wanna

1084
01:02:57,589 --> 01:03:00,599
cause they're to be real change %uh

1085
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:04,680
even little things have changed that
help over long periods of time itself

1086
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,369
up to suspend their pressure take okay
