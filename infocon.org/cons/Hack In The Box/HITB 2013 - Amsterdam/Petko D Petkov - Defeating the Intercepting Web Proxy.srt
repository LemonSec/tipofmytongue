1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:05,910
Google

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,910
okay I'll

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,730
yes thank you

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,990
I am okay so

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,900
hold the title is pretty much just
self-explanatory

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,260
we'll talk about proxies we don't talk
about with security

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,140
it's pretty much my cup of tea if you
have to follow me for the last couple

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,769
years

9
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:40,859
I'm soul for civil we thought this talk
by

10
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,659
kinda discussing a little bit who is up
for my actually we doing these things

11
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,179
well first of all I'm doing it because
I'm replacing someone but that's besides

12
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:48,749
the point

13
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:54,260
I am so who is this stock for now for
civil war proxies

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,109
Mike how many have you using web proxies
as part of their

15
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,350
daily jobs or other nefarious purposes
and stuff

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,390
right okay some of pasta you pretty much
are familiar with the concept

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,130
so Jeff proxies generally awk

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,790
general purpose tools we use them to in
to serve the traffic between

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,350
Klein a server applications now we'll
talk about this web proxy sweet talking

20
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,680
about any kind of a proxy

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,840
could be also proxy doubts hijacks

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,140
calls from one applications captures the
data

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,780
says to these are these modifies it
pushes it back through the normal

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,490
streams

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,720
I similar to what some are tools like a
commune options the for doing right

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,560
soul based on this definition this the
target audience for this presentation is

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,360
for this presentation particular are
deep penetration testers

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,130
or as no misspent Estes testing pence

29
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,390
and of quality assurance people

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,530
people who use proxies on a daily basis
I

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,070
people who are generally interested in
security at and I wanna see how things

32
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,810
are working

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,740
and also I should ask people who are

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,319
or leave on the AH of innovation now
this is a big thing to say

35
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,299
some people disagree with me but what we
gonna show all today

36
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,739
are stuff that I believe personally my
personal opinion

37
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,829
haven't been done before and they're
pretty nu

38
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,640
on cutting edge and sometimes I find it
very difficult to explain more they are

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,969
because people already have to sort of a
steer type in mindset about this stuff

40
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,569
tools and how they should work

41
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,260
so I'm gonna show you tools star are
very very different from what he's too

42
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,620
ion services just a week in the talk
about

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,969
was upcoming what kinda publications we
are seeing to test in the near future

44
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,049
I or exciting stuff and

45
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:48,650
sup just as a as a a bit of a warning

46
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,959
if you actually don't know anything
about proxies

47
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,540
you much to find some of the slights
lucky from a ship good that's pretty

48
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,400
much what the flights will be like

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,760
picture with the census masa self

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,069
why web proxies alsace because they

51
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,430
actually suck as

52
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,680
up French people will say on I'll be
working we process for the past 10 years

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,939
of actually seen them

54
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,010
I see I know how they work every time I
get frustrated

55
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,790
a star writing my own proxy god knows
why never do that are you gonna

56
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,849
invest a lot of time into keep for talk
that's not gonna work is gonna

57
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,189
basically the same a Ino um you know

58
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:37,359
be suffer rethought its software

59
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,370
but of course it is it's made from soft
or so that's

60
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,980
that's to be expected I am and whip
racks is generally

61
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,189
has been parked a very very vital for a
big part

62
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:51,799
love the our web application security
personnel in also everybody's

63
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,139
everybody uses tools a commercial tools
whoops

64
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:00,069
the low

65
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,969
give me a second

66
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,069
ale so everybody uses tools like harbor

67
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,120
alsop professionally and I am

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,510
and the question really is for us guys
is up

69
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,720
why why we're proxies is there time over
and

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,000
the ass were and I'll give you the
answer right now instead of Kent

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,259
the answer is No so you can leave now
their time is not over

72
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,319
but and I recently in almost a gloss
persons can be seen not to use that type

73
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,210
of tools right

74
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,650
because I've actually rollet recently
two more proxies it how

75
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,889
just writing the for fun you know and
spread time you know it is gone other

76
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:38,160
one

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,229
and some up but I much to-ing support
for better tool some by saying better

78
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,860
tools I mean like tools

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,270
for me doubt are easier to use there are
more into a tiff

80
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,720
and for me personally a good too is a
tool

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,800
actually gives me a lot of context
information I honestly I'm not

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,750
one of the guys like from the movies
that look said hexadecimal called all

83
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,310
day long

84
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,930
you know I can do it you know I rather
have a tool that just tells me the stuff

85
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,720
that I don't know

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,560
me know so in other words the tool for
me is my left or right hand

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,020
so want I wanna to the provides a lot of
context information

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,860
but not too much because I'm not going
to be able to accept another West

89
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,210
so so begin to go along ok arm

90
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,400
beginner talk about the stuff saw basic
security tools

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,860
their general purpose the provided
visibility of the comp's

92
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,400
now is a some stuff and by the way

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,220
out why a process has been so popular
during testing

94
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,639
is because up I'm

95
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,909
not want to reason me are the humankind
will not rebuilding

96
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,379
very complex applications let's be
honest you know beach P looks a bit like

97
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,580
CGI

98
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,090
and Tom open you no reason the people
start building more complex efficacious

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,970
like

100
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,650
you know using WebSockets and in all
kinds of crazy technology so coming

101
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,830
right now like we've RTS and stuff like
this

102
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,430
soul free proxy sexy came in a in a in a
time

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,919
where there was actually very good need
for this type of tools and their work

104
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,189
you know they were doing a pretty

105
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:11,849
pretty good job because this in a way
proxies are also a little bit like

106
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,770
network sniffers the weather design you
know you got the

107
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,139
he got the you go the screen we can see
like all the traffic coming through

108
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:18,949
seeking

109
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,729
just go up and I'll about

110
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,210
we can now we gonna go on from the next
lights and we're gonna show you

111
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,569
is going to be a bit of a rant about
some of the stuff about my purse is that

112
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,919
unlike

113
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,939
so we're building up the presentation
gradually until I get to death

114
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,210
right so first thing

115
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,360
most of them are written in Java now

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,189
this is it because Joe is nice

117
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,229
my like Java but snow that's probably
not the case

118
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,169
is it because it's easy %ah thus
probably is the case

119
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,379
but more important is because there is
actually previous art

120
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,479
now if you look at any trace the history
of like some %uh this

121
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,759
most popular web proxy these days
actually based on Java tools

122
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,689
to have been written many years ago and
you know it doesn't take

123
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,810
a rocket scientists to sort of look at
the cold and see how this stuff works

124
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,580
on you can you can learn a lot from by
reverse-engineering

125
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,849
Java process we can actually create the
same mechanism seen on Java applications

126
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:26,340
it's pretty easy to start now jeff also
have a very good support for SSL

127
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,389
typically it's very high level a lot of
we know interesting and nice functions

128
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,479
to use

129
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,659
it's not like using open SSL Laura NNs

130
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,509
which is like more low level stuff that
you might actually North kinda

131
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,610
understand what this cost and solve our

132
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,800
on what is the right way we call certain
certain functions in the right order

133
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,680
at the for that so it actually makes it
easy to do intercepting process and

134
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,949
stuff like this

135
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,870
and also a lot of developers also Java
developers so that actually helps this

136
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,439
is one of the reasons why

137
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,689
approx is saddam written in Java

138
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:01,990
now um also because they're written in
Java my personal opinion

139
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,270
is out there pretty slow compared to
native applications

140
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,680
art that's because not because job
itself is slow

141
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,699
but because arm this type of tools they
actually take a lot of data the process

142
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,999
a lot of data that take

143
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,810
arm they actually use a lot of the the
heap sauce a look at it for the virtual

144
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,590
machine

145
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,340
and therefore sometimes when you're
playing with a proxy need to adjust the

146
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,169
right settings just to get it work with
certain types of applications

147
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,509
otherwise the crash for the perform
really really badly

148
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,409
in many situations the fine defined the
case that the proxy itself is fighting

149
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,919
always the kernel

150
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,599
in some ways so in other words you know
the current lease doing some stuff like

151
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,229
swapping pages from memory to this and
this and that and proxies doing the same

152
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,000
thing

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,089
and then they are all fighting for like
what the if she didn't know what they're

154
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,889
doing with each other you know one of
them is so I think that this the other

155
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,450
one is taking from memory than

156
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,529
writing to the disc any just confused
all the time

157
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,740
because they're motivated and actually
don't have this sort of work

158
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,430
performers he has mints in mind when
they were written

159
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,959
also going to the next like

160
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,200
most boxes a buffering this means that

161
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,260
all the requests and responses are
buffer before they display to the user

162
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,350
why this is down so well just purely for

163
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,170
you I perspective you need to show some
sort of a traffic to the STU the user

164
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,800
I see you want to actually see requests
I see see what topic wes is all about

165
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,920
wanna see an image you want to see what
the image is all about this means that

166
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,120
these data needs to be prefect first

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,209
and then displayed so they're not
screaming in a string from one end to

168
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:30,950
another

169
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,649
that makes arm the whole user experience
about process a pretty pretty arm

170
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,660
pretty badly my opinion right especially
when you work with the

171
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,630
very very complex applications that
generate a lot of traffic when it come

172
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,350
to this

173
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,010
our little um

174
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,230
job is also very very wanted to type a
platform

175
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,680
are although you can write Tom in on on
credit Colt

176
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,000
are pretty much like on the synchronous
code or something like this: but because

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,010
most people think in terms of threats
muscle the code is the near

178
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,010
in Java applications saw your sort of a
forced to think

179
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,230
in mentality of in a buffering data
doing for loops and stuff like this

180
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,079
it makes this thing quite slow I am

181
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,149
this is also why when you working with
large files

182
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,930
are pretty much it's a disaster you know
are most books is actually tend not to

183
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,339
be able to understand large files

184
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,540
you wanna pull like several gigabytes of
data to a proxy

185
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,240
approx is likely to crash may not be
able to display the stuff

186
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,720
or some other more clever proxies they
just ignore the request is almost like

187
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
it never happened

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,240
is just like okay there is a large file
coming through the pipe

189
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,930
I'm not going to talk about it you know
I just slip it through how almost like

190
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,690
it never happened at all you know

191
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,160
are just too just to make it make the
whole pic Asian work

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,029
now two structures can be implemented to
can overcome this type of problems

193
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,029
on one of them use to up for example
what i've seen in the in the

194
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,600
in a while is that one of them is to

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,089
to take the comp the lender just ring
the response I

196
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,760
but actually this sort of stuff don't
work when using more more

197
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,589
different 57 conflict and thin coating
stuff for this because you actually

198
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,279
wouldn't know

199
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,720
the total confirm that you know before
you actually receive the stuff

200
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,170
you know from the from the server and it
doesn't work really really well for

201
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,290
interception

202
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,019
some just laying out all this promise
right the second

203
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,240
for you know up in on the second
structure which is one useful proxies

204
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,519
is to use offering and to buffer the
request or response until

205
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,029
you know everything is in memory and any
shift to use it

206
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,670
because it is also on this brooks' don't
have any pipeline

207
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,139
built into them now a lot of proxies
work on the bases up you make a

208
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,959
connection

209
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,269
and the connection is pretty much a
request the

210
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,690
request is satisfied by response on you
terminate the connection

211
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,420
it makes it very easy to program the
whole thing the reason being is because

212
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,040
ages it's just simple unfortunately from
riles prospectus like Chrome and Firefox

213
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,620
they don't quite work the exact same way

214
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,680
they are designed to be a lot more
performant so for example if you look at

215
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,310
nicole

216
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,480
or someone in autunno the name of what
chrome

217
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,779
is using as a network library and any
but what they do they try to pipeline is

218
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:14,209
much

219
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:18,310
requests as possible but I'm not talking
about the fish nice to be pipeline am

220
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,070
talking about like keeping the same
soccer

221
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,940
opened just put one request so despite
but next request satisfy put that the

222
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,529
notes section on the next one and so on
so forth

223
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,490
it makes it really difficult to write
such a piece of software for proxies

224
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,370
because arm in my experience what I've
done this in the past is that you've got

225
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,800
this sort of a

226
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,060
really basic books though we used to
have sweet

227
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,170
you know like squeezing stuff like this
like cache poisoning attacks

228
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,720
I actually happened on their you know on
Fox like purple stuff like this

229
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,180
so that's why there's no pipeline just
keep it simple

230
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,880
but also is not very very performance

231
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,560
next WebSockets are basically not
support

232
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,930
now y de Boer than the WebSocket is
pretty much the next

233
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,930
the next wave up development have a very
very

234
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,850
a possibly cations and and the support
at the moment for WebSockets pretty poor

235
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,389
the reason being is because keeping mine
all the slides before now

236
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,820
right there's no fight lining he doesn't
support larch

237
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,920
requests right the small steaming its
buffering

238
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,370
sorting in in theory WebSockets cannot
be supporting traditional way

239
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,060
proxies a written to just come work that
way seen it design

240
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,180
not only completely different using its
face but also the proxy will need to

241
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,490
work in a completely different way

242
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,110
because in a WebSocket world establish a
connection and then there is a cost a

243
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,670
communication a message is sent from the
server

244
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,949
to the client back and forth you know so
what's ok it's a basic not support that

245
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,490
now

246
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,730
I'm not saying there's not something or
support at all in fact if you look at

247
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,990
some of the open-source boxes like sup

248
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,740
they have some kind of problem in to
reply guess that work with the most

249
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,720
basic

250
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,750
arm sort of which socket implementations
but the more the bus once

251
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,420
are be much more supportive on the top
without

252
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,220
if you think about it what's boxes are
designed to analyze a stupid traffic

253
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,009
now when you talk about WebSockets it
could be something that is clear taxi

254
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:09,800
may not be

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,709
could be some kind of a binary particle
that actually never seen or you don't

256
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,209
even know how it works

257
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,829
so week we backlink to I'll

258
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:21,170
you know sort of to to look cooling

259
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,149
dot big you know that a helpless to do
more advance reverse engineering

260
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,259
that's that's what we basically need on
this tougher not support

261
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,569
also not to mention it does I have they
don't have support for stuff like with

262
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:34,440
RTS

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,730
stuff like this you not think that the
okay they're not everywhere crime has

264
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,350
been there in like a hour

265
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,680
development channels but you know it's
the stuff that will likely show up

266
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,920
everywhere and people start using

267
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,350
play not indication you with proxies is
to

268
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,449
he's usually are quite faithful arm

269
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:56,959
in a in a way that for example

270
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,480
I because something said efforts up some
some applications do much to support

271
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,630
authentication so in order to enable
them

272
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,350
some clients you need to set up onto
gation at the proxy level so the proxy

273
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,639
does the heavy lifting

274
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,459
for this client application very often
you much you want to create something

275
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,019
like a bus script that doesn't know
anything about cookies

276
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,779
doesn't know anything about session
management doesn't know anything about

277
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,699
SSL

278
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,120
but you still want to use it to test an
application that uses on Sat

279
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,089
authentication or something like this:

280
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,259
then you know you think that okay are we
gonna set up

281
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,180
8 a.m. Halloween a set up a
authentication a proxy for sure quite

282
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,600
difficult to configure be guessing it's
actually do with this all these realms

283
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,259
sometimes is not that easy I am and

284
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:43,300
some because I dot

285
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,759
because the Brussels education schemes
and the price wasa home

286
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,560
you know a in a things can go goal when
you're testing

287
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,279
are you know the election of work the
only problem the problem with this

288
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,949
is out even though you think that he's
probably working but actually dawn on to

289
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,019
star on the lysing

290
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,920
the data at a more granular level so
sometimes the sexual even confusing

291
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,490
so the more to use a support in in in in
proxies for modification for you

292
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,639
is also pretty about

293
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,490
going X SSL authentication is also
pretty faithful

294
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,420
you know yeah you can set a client
certificates you know most books allowed

295
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,769
to do that sort of things

296
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,920
but you know Java as a framework itself
doesn't actually give you a lot of

297
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,350
a axis actually its job is based as far
as a note to end it NNs

298
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,050
sought the basie credit the very nice
rapport around the netscape secure

299
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,170
socket libros and

300
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,579
are you can do a lot of things with it
but he doesn't

301
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,819
I've from my experience on their custom

302
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:46,230
what indications using hardware tokens
and things like that

303
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,050
especially when you do banking and or
for example

304
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,240
a team some banks in UK the actual
chippy

305
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,339
a device to you not the ones that are
completely wireless but the one that

306
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,329
text me to plug into your computer

307
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,500
and then yes she meets its ok for
corporate banking stuff you know

308
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,640
this stuff actually use um more advance

309
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,169
hard with talking base of of tutsis self
indication

310
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,189
and therefore proxies by the fall they
don't work so people who working in a

311
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,400
bank in this study they face the problem

312
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,679
that they can actually use these tools
the they simply comp

313
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,819
you know so they need to rely on other
other techniques

314
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,919
to being overcome this problem I am

315
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,880
sawing from Dover perspective mixing
manage Colt with what Chavez

316
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,530
with native code is perhaps arm I've
seen a lot of hacks

317
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,110
but none of them are stable

318
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,190
now custom authentication is also not
quite nice and procs it's now

319
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,500
if you do with the very very simple
applications simple form based

320
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,289
authentication

321
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,440
you what's really well if you do with
applications that just requires

322
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,590
you not the cookies and stuff like this
which is the majority of the cases

323
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,630
online then that's fine but

324
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,140
you know E as a pen tester I've seen a
lot of the cases the action not return

325
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,630
like that

326
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,289
and they all customized if you actually
a move you know goal from my arm

327
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:06,320
Europe to our Asia or something nice
Yousfi

328
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,780
you fine actually working with
technologies that are not given familiar

329
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,280
to you you know it's a very foreign
stuff

330
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,450
using ActiveX controls fortification and
what not to not not even actually using

331
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,010
cookies itself on using something else

332
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,700
I'll see if you taking about
applications done a more high-level like

333
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,750
for example

334
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,510
up petitions return on flashed up to
communicate over a

335
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,850
and their the martian not use any
session management system the system is

336
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,020
missus improper use

337
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,730
is issue a license for the MF messages
but I sent back and forth from the

338
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,570
server

339
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,870
are if you something like GWT can also
the sort of thing so it's not

340
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,049
necessary when we talk about whether
pick a shit doesn't imply

341
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:47,330
that actually there's a session
management system gonna you know

342
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,330
especially with the new facebook
application is that I've seen lately the

343
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,140
stuff that a basin WebSockets

344
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,260
that is totally optional you know where
they'll do it as a cookie so with all

345
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,520
send this data

346
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,919
over a WebSocket it's completely
optional

347
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,409
therefore proxies actually don't have to
sort of support for custom

348
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,630
authentication

349
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,720
and perhaps you can expand proxy to some
sort of appliance

350
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,659
which is an option but then you need to
create a plan you for every single

351
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,620
custom altercation at the scene while

352
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,049
and sooner or later that becomes are
quite a burden

353
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:22,760
is also there's a mint anise problem I
also need to know how to do it properly

354
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,140
and so on so forth

355
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,510
generally speaking proxies are pretty
much

356
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,549
up

357
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:40,190
Fox is a pretty much up time-consuming
setup

358
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,630
everything is just a request and
response not just any of their purpose

359
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,480
and function

360
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,780
by saying this is about from the proxy
perspective every application what's the

361
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,169
same

362
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,110
is just as serious a request and
response now that was finding the C Joe

363
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,120
world

364
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,370
but it's not fine today because most of
a justice they stare not render

365
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,299
as external pages they actually not you
hold up a cation perhaps not even from

366
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,039
the several orders from cash

367
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,620
so actually there's no request made to
the from server all the functionalities

368
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,320
are

369
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,330
just fewer client-side JavaScript stuff
like this

370
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,830
and then the cation makes just some
calls maybe costar which is a WebSocket

371
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,590
for fast communication

372
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,070
and it takes us from there I am

373
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,350
proxies generally don't pass

374
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,549
d grandma test for ease of use that's my
opinion

375
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,390
and as this next slice s

376
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,559
from Charles long as a quote that the
most intelligent

377
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,200
up the most strongest not the most wrong
a species

378
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,409
or the most intelligence a life but I am

379
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,470
but the one with the most the the one
that most

380
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,130
a duck responsive to change generally
speaking

381
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,350
proxies are stuck in H when a key piece
was popular know how many if you

382
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,870
remember Keith

383
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,320
there was one of the out say probably
the first practice

384
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,740
me quote be formal maybe there is there
was another one before that so

385
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,150
police apologists you know but I was one
of the first popular once

386
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,740
soul we are basically stuck in a key
slats a few see a Keith

387
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,090
I don't know when it was written but
every member like

388
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,630
I vaguely remember using this in 2000
want to or something minus

389
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,590
you know so maybe I'm wrong up but if
you see

390
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,710
from this the fuzzy picture and I did a
fuzzy because action

391
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,299
the XK show was pretty fuckin also had
to make it because it's a look bad on

392
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,350
the screen

393
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,570
um it's pretty much the same stuff that
we see today

394
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,330
so for the last eleven years no
innovation

395
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,860
whatsoever we using the same rudimentary
tools

396
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,360
we have been using for the last ten
years to test applications

397
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,230
drastically change shift that from CGI

398
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,010
to completely Molden client-side

399
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,330
stack with all some awesome technologist
right

400
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,720
now what is this climb 5 likable some
technologists

401
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,000
this okay this is basically a game

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,679
that is called all two of them a few
this is a game called banana bread

403
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,690
effectively that the PD shooter s pretty
good by the way

404
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,320
it eat it is out safe from from

405
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,850
I E arm a

406
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,919
I don't know from our of 3d graphics
point of view

407
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:30,190
using just wave GL ET's a then good

408
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,150
you know implementation other gay you
know its he does he has a

409
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,179
you really good what affects he has a
very good why you know what love FX

410
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,880
he said just the prof casa but basically
gives you an idea

411
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,730
where it is browser technologies is
headed effectively the browser

412
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,390
is that will team up client you know is
the most general purpose

413
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,159
client arm house

414
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,940
'em a a

415
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,279
so so imagine that the situation way
with testing

416
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,350
maybe two years from now you know we're
testing actually a proper games

417
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,950
and you know this games there's not
going to like RPC requests

418
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,510
to it you know some Jason serialized
data stuff that is the disease for us to

419
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,200
see

420
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,770
you know everybody who has seen like
some other protocols that but on it he's

421
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,330
using this is not quite something that
is

422
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,049
readable he can you eat anyway you know
you need to actually understand the

423
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,809
particle because it's pretty much see
life

424
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,650
you know some civilized Eddie know when
you transfer your number you're not

425
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,669
actually running

426
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,440
the number let's say 1 in ASCII which
takes eight bits

427
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,520
you much you you know write something
smaller that just takes one bit like to

428
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,020
go up 4-2 bus

429
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,679
are horrible into just the stuff is

430
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,360
and %uh also is confirmed by this thing

431
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,679
now this my friends is the Unreal 3
Engine running on

432
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,990
a up project called a sound .gs

433
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,580
ID works really really well often Realty

434
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,130
you know so we're talking about like a
really high and Gaming Inc

435
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,230
potentially running on browser
technologies this is

436
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,980
absolutely possible even with today's
moderate hard work

437
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,000
you know you need Flash

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,779
you have a good acceleration up 3d
graphics file with GL

439
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,980
have a very very powerful client like
Google Chrome and Firefox

440
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,340
a Google Chrome JavaScript engine is
really fast

441
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,360
it's not an interpreter this knowledge
on skype interpreter

442
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,409
it's just be compiler it doesn't have
interpretation of

443
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:31,620
it doesn't interprets anything it
doesn't parse thinks

444
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,970
the Parsis thinks the first time then
after that is basically

445
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,669
memory you know so basically the

446
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:42,330
the stuff that you loath even if it's a
lost of in into

447
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,590
a a lot of cold the too low he can run
as smoothly

448
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,600
as you as you want and we today
multiprocessor architecture browsers

449
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,080
day the pre much right there

450
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,720
maybe with the okay maybe not exactly
right there but the improvements that I

451
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,279
see happening in the next one or two
years

452
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,450
is going to enable this topic
applications very very rich occasions

453
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,570
to work in a browsing farm

454
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,340
the to test the application like this
one that's not gonna work in a web proxy

455
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,429
you know but is still required gonna
saying that all the British is gonna be

456
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,610
TD

457
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,809
but some of them will be you know
someone there will be games

458
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,080
so home we are left with two choices: we
either need to engineer something

459
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,100
completely custom

460
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,370
all we need to shift our focus from

461
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,450
the way we perceive web proxies Inouye

462
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,880
to the new way where we perceive the
proxy tools in a completely completely

463
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,840
different

464
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,760
I am and riff you know refreshing for
you right

465
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,130
saw as I said before the whole team with
client

466
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,510
is really the browser the most powerful
clan ever built

467
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,230
just to give you some statistics I

468
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,220
Google Chrome breeding your browser at
seven million Lasko

469
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,750
indoor on the same the call the call
comes know that as a packaged

470
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,700
application

471
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,730
but you know thats of the rough it wants

472
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,210
a Firefox as nine million bicycles
unless colonel has 14 minutes ago

473
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,779
to dashing north of our from being
pretty

474
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,360
bake in or in terms of like the you know
I'm on work that has been put in to make

475
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,929
this technology is right

476
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:23,399
also if you look at it like her I i
tryed

477
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:26,840
reason need to download the cool chrome
compilat

478
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,450
and I gave up you know weicker's the
sources like one point something

479
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,230
gigabytes

480
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,330
compressed or foc who does that

481
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,179
you know you'd imagine the source to be
a lot less in this and they say like

482
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,940
yeah we need like a quad-core processor
with an of 16 gigabytes around to

483
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,950
compile it

484
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,700
and I cannot thank you goodbye to
dispense

485
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,549
your rights you know there's some guys
on get up the composite so I don't want

486
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,770
from them

487
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,570
so long so in all this is not really the

488
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,710
you know it's not a is known and as far
as I know on on Firefox

489
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,260
day actually con compiler if my memory
correct

490
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,130
you know I designed this evening but the
con compile a time when the study to

491
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,240
mean 32 which is not possible because
the and never had the need to locate for

492
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,919
some operations so big there I'll space
immediately

493
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,330
you know saw them tried to do some hacks
by splitting the working interview

494
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,649
I mean I'm not I'm not an expert in
ordered of actually compile

495
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:30,320
lover of components for Firefox and the
muscle up you know runtime:

496
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,769
and some of my projects and he was
working fine but you know by reading

497
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:34,850
some forums

498
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,190
people work is something was saying OK
we can support this

499
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,159
a you know version of Visual Studio we
can support the architecture because we

500
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,470
just can't compile for this

501
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,700
you know it just sarkodie so much that
the choice would fit into

502
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,769
memory enough so

503
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,970
yeah lot of it's a bit slow numbers

504
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:59,010
means lines of coke so because this one
I'm trying to come here

505
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,100
is that the browser as a client already
packs and

506
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,779
all some power you don't like a a
technology

507
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:09,799
not he's pretty much universal me many
many ways

508
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,990
source EAS all applications though we
were talking about like

509
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,350
you know de mi you know all kinds of
applications smolder

510
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,899
you've CGI or whatever they are the
moving to the web

511
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,909
uneven most basic on the men three types
of hardware

512
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,159
you buy today like TV's like get posters

513
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,769
they have web interfaces the you access
via web browser

514
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:33,350
it makes perfect sense to shift doc
proxy thing

515
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,679
now we're talking about from paper party
client

516
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,039
into the client which is doctor brother
so that's what we gonna be talking about

517
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,179
next

518
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,659
salt some of the stuff that I built it
surrounds got extra five

519
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,760
good for render I'm going to talk about
it so much

520
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,559
but it's pretty pretty good the be good
to the technology for building more

521
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,039
types of applications good-looking go to
a script

522
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,289
JavaScript it's not my favorite language

523
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:03,399
it's not a programming language it is a
scripting language

524
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:06,850
it's a huge difference between them

525
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,110
I am if you go to

526
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,279
%uh Mozilla one of my favorite platforms

527
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,710
he packs to really good technologist
Nick 1x Bacan

528
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,100
I hear the Allscripts become I hope they
don't do not but this is like

529
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,460
one of the most in or extensible things
that i've seen

530
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,630
on my knees but its goals after the
Microsoft com technology

531
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,210
but it's even better because it's a
crossbar from it's not binary compatible

532
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:30,870
anymore

533
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:34,169
from POF someone versions of Firefox
have another but

534
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:37,529
effectively if all the components a
Firefox a return this compares

535
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:40,419
if all the features a Firefox everything
is components you can you can

536
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:41,429
effectively replace

537
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,960
every single feature we dock recompiling
the whole Firefox

538
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,700
so let's say that I wanna replace the
way FTP

539
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,929
works in Firefox it just right and you
you know Firefox compound registry

540
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:56,059
without with the ID and then I can
replace did

541
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,320
sauna FTP function on to sweep all
fucked by two so allows greater

542
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,850
accessibility

543
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,299
know if legal tool the consignee things
calm exposes love AP ice

544
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:09,659
the usually very high level and that's
why a lot of people say a crime is

545
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,899
really really fast

546
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:13,750
me know when there's no plugins for the
reason being is because they actually

547
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,460
gonna lie to Mike about

548
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,110
with their architecture too much to just
give you some user-friendly APIC call

549
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,309
this function

550
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,799
pretty much kids play and then you have
for some functionality

551
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:27,409
nevertheless even with this limitations

552
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:33,010
chrome can do cross-domain call seeking
to Sauk it's like TCP new TB sockets

553
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,070
I can do request a response monitoring I
am

554
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,990
and you know whatever I cannot support
in my eyes and party plugin

555
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,010
and you will you will work fine in this
environment

556
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,059
so technically speaking we got this this
pack

557
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,570
%ah a for browsers up

558
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,669
all them working in its own way that

559
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:57,139
we can probably left their all their
power which uses for

560
00:30:57,139 --> 00:31:02,200
fourth security testing and what not he
also if we develop everything

561
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,539
as a browser sort of application a new
thing in that mentality

562
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,610
because %uh very very portable piece of
technology so I'm gonna show you next

563
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,870
is actually a pic /a should also running
a Chromebook and the Chromebook only

564
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:14,710
house

565
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,080
appraiser it doesn't have anything else
but I can't quite

566
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,490
easily take a Chromebook and go to a job
I can do a job by Chromebook

567
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,529
no problem you know not want to reason
you wouldn't be able to do that

568
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:29,909
you could probably use the debugger
tools and stuff like this but

569
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:33,779
that's not going to be very nice so just
to show you a little bit

570
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,799
of this so the progress the technology
I'll show you later

571
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,500
if actually knock one you because some
of the work that I started

572
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,490
it took like a almost seven years the
form you life

573
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,950
in my head generally how it's going to
look like so back in 2005 2006 circa

574
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,880
there was a lie read on to develop call
the talk API it's dead now

575
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,210
com first for good but then

576
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,799
in 2006-2007 there was a a tool for
Firefox call Technica

577
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,120
which is like a browser security
scripting environment again this is dead

578
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,480
then in now in the also house

579
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,580
ulcer I think in 2009 I demonstrated is
to call weaponry

580
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,750
which was written on top of the actual

581
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,190
now it's another was a look technology
which kinda was expanding on idea using

582
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,840
browsers

583
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,549
a security testing tools that one is
also

584
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:29,210
I in some ways that for good and

585
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,700
what we aren't working right now is a
set of tools I'm gonna talk about them

586
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,760
dot lifts all the stuff all the

587
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,510
all the techniques that I've learned
from the previous years for the last

588
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,409
seven years

589
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:43,809
and puts them in a completely different
dimension and just show you some modest

590
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,529
tools and how they work

591
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,929
saw that's basically is the suit now
what is the city

592
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,760
the city's effectively just like 15 coat

593
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,320
so you go to website website gives you
peace a function on T a lot of course

594
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,090
are showing on the screen how much is it

595
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,380
is locked and it the browser Texas

596
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,539
be some functionality and it starts you
know pending an on-screen

597
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,130
there's no client there's no server in
this case sewing other in other words

598
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,549
all the stuff that we gonna be doing

599
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:18,639
the gonna run effective from your
browser see somebody thinks all we can

600
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:21,269
use these tools and we can hack someone
and then

601
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:24,299
is gonna look like you coming from a
different IP address not we can actually

602
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:25,570
come from your network

603
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,580
you know so don't do that and up because

604
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,769
all this stuff actually execute from
your browser

605
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,730
just to give you an example up the
differences between

606
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,669
this and that software as a service is
out one of the most in the browser

607
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:42,860
the other one was in the clock some
pretty simple once one of them was in

608
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,490
your harbor

609
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,230
the owners in a different car it's
instant persecute you know if you

610
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,429
something like Wallace or maybe

611
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:54,120
some of the other stuff up you know you
basically put a job want us over the 70s

612
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,350
to perform the job thing comes back to
result

613
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,649
DUP basically doesn't use this
effectively a

614
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:03,769
eighty a provocation you know I'll take
certification is not a website is an

615
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:09,130
application

616
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,410
so what do you do come to talk a little
bit about architecture

617
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,740
and then I'll show you some demoss so
first of all

618
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,780
the way the whole thing works is doubt
by

619
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,020
you can ride it just lined up you might
think that I'm gonna start reading joe

620
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,090
skip tomorrow

621
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,740
and he's going to work after seven years
of trying to do that I realize that's

622
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,520
not possible

623
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,770
on a stress again just get is a
scripting language is not a programming

624
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,030
language you can program

625
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,460
you can good things together I it is a
very good for assembling stuff that's

626
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,210
why a lot of people say you're just
copies the some love the web

627
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,930
they're pretty much correcting of a Sam
is also pretty good

628
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:48,340
and neat archetypal language but you
know it's not for like the faint-hearted

629
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,430
you not so you can write the for complex
piece of software

630
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,010
so in order to make all this stuff work
up

631
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,700
we had to effectively scrape the use of
JavaScript and ride home

632
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,020
compiler on be on the top %uh vaguely
custom programming language so we found

633
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,570
familiar and easy to use

634
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,860
so we use a geek %uh something which by
the Korean

635
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,740
to all the unit testing on the stuff
just like in general purpose programming

636
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,590
language

637
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,690
then use a compound of the compound is
translated into JavaScript

638
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,090
and puts it into into the browser

639
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,310
unfortunately not everything will work
this way

640
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,380
because as you mind no the job in a
browser have their own security policies

641
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,210
and and security restrictions

642
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,220
so therefore we need also a very
lightweight extension

643
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,400
on the top on that what this extension
dust is just

644
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,650
kick seen in a situation is where we
want to perform an action that is

645
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,890
usually not allow

646
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,040
for us to do so just keep in mind
everything the city from a website

647
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,040
therefore you need to allow that website
to Duke lacrosse to make communication

648
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,500
unity socket saying that this sort of
stuff are typically not allow for the

649
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,340
petition to use

650
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,000
yet you know our team was only seven
this a

651
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,780
this thing in a pipeline the muzzle a
marketplace which allows you to create

652
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,250
with applications and you can define
intense

653
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:04,120
on one of the tenses like me know use
sockets for example or something like

654
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,520
this:

655
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,870
so that when he stole the pic ation is
gonna ask you what do you want to stall

656
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,140
this application to use

657
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,440
the socket and then in on this or a
high-level API is gonna be provided to

658
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,150
the suffocation

659
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,790
so you know we don't have this function
ninety at the normal browse us but we

660
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,240
will have

661
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,080
maybe the next couple years so the way
this thing works for market actual point

662
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,840
of view

663
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,970
you got expansion in the middle
extension taxes a some kind ever bitter

664
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,580
so we actually send a lot of commands
from the extension then they go to the

665
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,860
let's say the fun you know with testing
stuff come back

666
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,750
may go back to our core also

667
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,860
we can this this whole situation can get
a little bit more tricky year

668
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,210
when we use something called with
workers the reason we use web corpus is

669
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:46,720
because

670
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,030
you want to make it look more
multi-threaded just if you do a lot of

671
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,940
our

672
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,190
a a lot of stuff you know in a in a in
an environment like the browser

673
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,740
im actually locket and he's still got a
lot to render properly indefinite you

674
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,230
getting up

675
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:03,200
one on this nasty boxes 26 terminate the
script seen or to avoid this you need to

676
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,080
run it into wanna dislikes a process
like worker

677
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,590
but to do a worker then you need to do
also more

678
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,830
more levels of indirection but to
actually get all this likely will parts

679
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,260
work in a in a in a good way and thus
cannot be done enough

680
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,300
human way Ino any to almost

681
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,710
compile it somehow enough to make it
work

682
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,300
so using this are set up for thinks

683
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,550
we can do we can send requests on you to
any arbitrary point

684
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,870
we can intercept in his actions i think
is actually in two separate questions

685
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,250
bosses

686
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,280
and we can also access low-level IPS

687
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,530
so what I'm gonna do next for the next
20 minutes

688
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,840
is just show you are some of the stuff
in action

689
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,030
now ass off the phone to show you

690
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,680
we we use this tool so by the way to
discover all ability sing the buckboard

691
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,810
bounty programs

692
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,650
you know and one of them was seen paper
which we go pay

693
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,030
and then a I was this the yesterday and
those are they still there

694
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:08,730
some still thinking should I show it to
you under

695
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,500
we'll see and I'm

696
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,770
K first will be for move on I wanna show
you this

697
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:21,870
this is the our banana bread application
was talking about

698
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,070
safe I if I do this

699
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,110
okee in the resolution is pretty crap
because I need to I need to do it here

700
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,750
up I but you know that's a pretty sure
that runs from a browser

701
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,750
pretty good K

702
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,960
the dojo vehicle control over the mosque
isms playing on on the

703
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,050
on the secondary monitor for

704
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,710
you know you have to admit this is a
very very good implementation

705
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,470
you know again

706
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,000
no this is the kind of soft white speck
too happy not to our

707
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,410
start seem very time over and you you
know soon

708
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:04,470
now tional

709
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:11,470
options

710
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,350
a a

711
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,970
ok im gonna try to cure my this place
just to make it easier for me

712
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:24,660
the worst thing about having a written
displays the

713
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,280
know everything looks reba arm

714
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,400
okay so hopefully that's work

715
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,880
so I'm gonna show you

716
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,440
some of these tools so

717
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,760
now this song is effectively just the
scanner

718
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,270
no one ish gonna show you some of the
sources

719
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,650
a file this too is made

720
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:58,650
it's pretty much the code

721
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,130
somos de Guise almost there they are
okay

722
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,849
now this is a lot of Kansai Co and needs
to be processed

723
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,049
I'm interesting enough

724
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:24,400
group

725
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,589
I don't have internet sorry about see

726
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:35,589
its

727
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:45,130
its

728
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,390
no going to net up

729
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,420
icon use cable on this Mike you know EPO
eliminated all the good features

730
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,750
so what is these days

731
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,650
the do not fear I'm gonna watch via

732
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:22,650
E

733
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,800
meanwhile show you something else

734
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,520
talk reasoning

735
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,050
can tried sawyer

736
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,410
I know what I know what I'll see what
I'm using actually displaying here

737
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,670
I'm gonna talk about it later it's
basically Poor's men bpm

738
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,450
extension out just the kind of know we
can do it

739
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,750
okay so

740
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,950
thank you be responsive the

741
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,109
you know we can do whatever we actually
asked to talk to the cation we don't

742
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,859
think K

743
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:12,040
and you know all the stuff for running
from the browser

744
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,210
which is this normal you know any other
pic asians thank you

745
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,570
and but what we have fun here

746
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,640
you know define sick when Jack shins if
I cross a scripting

747
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,050
you know we find whenever some other you
know stuff

748
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,570
snow all this stuff actually run as this
point on application

749
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,830
we have any stole anything apart from
this like with extensions just to make

750
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,730
the whole thing happened

751
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,650
rights so everything is pretty much
running the client and that's the main

752
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,040
thing

753
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,170
now because we're talking about Fox's on
the Sri distal

754
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,030
which basically it's a is like a proxy
it is a proxy

755
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,359
but effectively it's not really a proxy
because nothing has been proxy

756
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,540
so if I want to go to go gonna start
searching for some stuff

757
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,970
Anna no Starbucks the recording dis
requests here

758
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:59,450
in Austin I can basically analyze them
in a typical way

759
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:03,340
to on on lies any other application
right the only difference is

760
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,609
is that we know is falling a proxy the
other differences

761
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:09,869
is that we don't care for example

762
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:14,780
are give the proxy will support this SSL
authentication on that custom parkour

763
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:20,100
on cash if the browser can actually if
your application can display and work in

764
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,970
a browser

765
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,680
is gonna run through this to just fine
in a safe use let's say some kind of a

766
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,320
custom

767
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,520
client-side authentication using a weird
technology and then poppy plants and

768
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,609
stuff like this

769
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,700
that is not a problem because all this
stuff will be visible

770
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,730
straightaway and I don't need to arm I
don't need to do any sort of a clever

771
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,240
magic

772
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,670
on the top of this you know how this
summer

773
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,930
this summer a usually most useful
displayed because this feature is not

774
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:47,619
return your

775
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:51,250
but typically on the proxy level you
don't actually know

776
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,710
what request which week for what reason
the request was made for

777
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,310
you just need to be quite you see a
request any serious policy don't know

778
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:58,720
why

779
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,250
you know you don't know if that was a
let's see an embedded image

780
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,470
you don't know it does actually comes
from a subframe you don't know if that

781
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,460
comes from a tap

782
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:10,510
that is late to the Picatinny or pop-up
window you have none of this information

783
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,160
why would I need this information all to
filter the traffic I certainly not

784
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,520
interested in static images

785
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,280
maybe can filter them out by a doctor a
pack and stuff like this and by content

786
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:19,680
type

787
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,340
but actually sometimes some images a
generated dynamically

788
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,390
so not all images should be excluded I
need to look at some images

789
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,670
that are generated dynamically because
potential there's a bugs in them

790
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,400
right up to how will they do that econ
filter by mime type:

791
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,180
right so one of the easiest ways to do
that is because we run in a browser

792
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,350
we have all this mess deformation there
was not available before

793
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:45,100
we know which stop made this information
we know which supplied medicine this is

794
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,720
this request we know if that was
embedded in the dome

795
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,780
when the dome was retriever as a study
page was generated

796
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,810
you know by some be so jealous guy fucks
martino we actually have this sort of

797
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,310
stuff so now we can not only about the
Picatinny thumbs up all this is the

798
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,550
topic to restructure

799
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,190
week an awesome app to condemn sup this
is how the pic Asian works

800
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,340
so we can actually create a work for the
says this function at least that request

801
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,170
police this list that right so we came
up this how the software for this sort

802
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,510
of stuff is not written yet

803
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,020
but you know if you if you wanna ride it
mean the with me you know them a few

804
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,770
feet to

805
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:22,170
a you know talk to me after this a

806
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,130
so so as you can see we can do this
stuff

807
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:29,700
and weekend we can for example while
it's a

808
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,740
a in or do the same stuff like a proxy

809
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,970
excuse the second ex rel

810
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:41,359
and you know I can get the same peaceful
shot a complete player request

811
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,250
I can modify it you know the same same
stuff I can

812
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,920
I can do whatever I want here you know
similarly to what proxies are

813
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,480
with the exception that if there was no

814
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,040
a client-side authentication going on I
don't have to set it up

815
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,080
because I've already the browser has
already authenticated in other words the

816
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,859
application so it's for BT's

817
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:08,680
a now

818
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,290
he's another piece of a Picatinny which
is one of my favorite

819
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,390
so what I want to show you is

820
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,660
how we can we can find some books

821
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:26,480
and potentially make also some some
money out of this

822
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,589
no I do this sort of stuff for fun
Malaysia don't have a lot of time for

823
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,560
research on

824
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,140
I'm writing process a but the

825
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,350
for example a few if we if you want to
do

826
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,470
it's a paper ok

827
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,260
that is an interesting faith party why
is because this a pic ation

828
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,330
if looking fruit discover

829
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,630
you know it takes like two seconds to to
discover tanks

830
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,230
and it just looks were looking for there
is nothing really

831
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,380
amazing about in a I'll spot

832
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,440
it when it looks for dislocating fruit
he also looks into every lever

833
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,950
very large scale so just because I type
a part of calm right now

834
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,960
it doesn't just look at papon of call
action looks it

835
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,160
everywhere up although up a Polish state

836
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,900
affecting it's a public ext
eight-and-a-half of different kinds of

837
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,030
applications

838
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,230
so it's going to look at virtual host as
you look like sup to Macy's can look

839
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:20,970
this stock

840
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:24,400
and he's not gonna perform any types the
scouts like for example cropping up

841
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,150
fussing 2.61 gestion cross a scripting
stuff for this is not gonna look for

842
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,630
that some stuff is not intrinsic

843
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,880
in anyways but what he will do you will
try to define

844
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,700
to find some sort of a in of maybe miss
configurations maybe I mean pages

845
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,210
maybe the fort default credentials and
things like that

846
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,310
see find the existing open and meanwhile
I can just another one

847
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,089
and 21 for Microsoft and all that some
people

848
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:54,950
from the public he s gonna be excited to
see no

849
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,750
and to we cannot do one for

850
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,089
thats cool bud part programs you know

851
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:07,030
young dicks justin Maxwell

852
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,510
Facebook

853
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:17,510
saw this function like this just
learning the process

854
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:26,769
it's a

855
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,440
no he saw the peace accord that you know
you this peace accord I soldier before

856
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,340
that sooo so you know I told her I

857
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,500
shortly before her up the SIS even with
this

858
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,780
and we went with so many from you know
things running at the same time you

859
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:48,780
still behaves pretty pretty nicely you
know as a as a as a client application

860
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,380
now

861
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,700
this is pretty much all the the for
example the domains that Facebook at the

862
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,450
moment house

863
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,610
are their offer to host saw over I
sticks you know

864
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,360
that maybe who want to explore
interesting enough for some weird reason

865
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,840
media center dork is also

866
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,240
a Facebook thing I don't know and some
other stuff

867
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,369
you know some question this is part of
this CD and so something

868
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:25,010
woman Press thought com why to know okay

869
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,950
and to obviously this too is a said its
low hanging fruit tool

870
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:32,030
so basically he pinpointed the right
direction but actually doesn't tell you

871
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,050
what the whole abilities

872
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,850
sometimes in the case of paper I did
discover some issues like this than

873
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:38,500
yesterday

874
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,540
it was a problem to a

875
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,950
this is the one it's a little really
really stupid problem it's basically a

876
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,280
costume an XML file

877
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,980
which is like her it's like is like easy
money

878
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,330
you know if you report this to pay Paul
but the problem is that this though

879
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,220
is still an issue you know effectually
you have this on their website the

880
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,310
special in this place

881
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:01,450
this means that their website is gonna
be cross a script the warren of

882
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,310
a which is effectively within the rules
so the bug bounty program

883
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,900
you know so well you know you know its

884
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,540
you know my point is upbeat us to
leverage the technology that is already

885
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,369
in a browser

886
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:18,070
to perform testing on the large-scale in
fact as one of the 10 the stuff that we

887
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:19,830
did a search for the research

888
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,420
is too I use April so base are

889
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,730
technology running a headless mode so
essentially at this what you see here

890
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,810
but there is no visual interface is
running in a in a headless

891
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,070
xserver effectively rock to scan the
internet

892
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:37,190
so that was the idea that was the
challenge to use a browser

893
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,440
discounting Thai internet and find all
the law can you from

894
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,090
you know the reason that and writing
this was piece of cake

895
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:49,570
you know a runtime for the whole thing
took about 30 minutes because we were

896
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,890
just hitting the front page we were not
actually doing expired in 2011

897
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,060
just like no downloading a LexA 1
million

898
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,780
in or I read you know it ain't over this
subdomains

899
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,890
I'll find their virtual hosts in on go
on like this in their recourse if mold

900
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,950
and just gone this far as deep as we can
in office

901
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,020
and some other stuff that you discover
absolutely hilarious

902
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,130
you know I am you know there's nowhere
to explain you know

903
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:19,540
you have to see for yourself a soul

904
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,180
now we can also

905
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,350
do some more the past upset thats like
for example fuzzy

906
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:32,440
you know now this is not going to work
is so much testing against the service

907
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,770
that doesn't support XML

908
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,330
adjacent but for example weekend you
know we can do

909
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,480
like some stuff that will require lower
for mutations

910
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,130
and mutation updater so you'd expect
everybody who is familiar with the

911
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,190
creek crossing products will probably
know all that one of the biggest promise

912
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,420
we will pick a shins

913
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,640
testing locations is that if you want to
be cooked

914
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,280
complete in your tests you need to
perform

915
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,960
tests on all the permutations

916
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,410
combinations uva for we all the payloads
that you wanna send

917
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:08,810
don't know imagine the situation you
might imagine the scale this

918
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,910
if you have a form that allows you to
select a

919
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,410
the country you know CFT fields and then
there is a drop down for country

920
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,119
are not thousands of requests

921
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:24,300
by their you know so it's a it's
basically a very very complex Barack

922
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,619
confessing product tonight and the way

923
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:30,960
he has to be done econ pre generated
because of the lower values

924
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,580
because you're not competing some kind
ovary will table for the values a

925
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,580
yes actually need to generate on the fly
so yes you don't even know how big

926
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,070
the courtesy more yeah she can compete 8
there how big the court asking for it

927
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,490
will be

928
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,810
but he still very competition intense
process

929
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:50,200
and the skin on this sort of stuff you
know we can actually do

930
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,760
quite easily using JavaScript you know

931
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,000
he works really really well it's been
designed to do that sort of things

932
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,310
absolutely amazingly well you know see
if I can if I want to create like a very

933
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,960
complex

934
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,520
Jason structure that has a in all some
stuff and

935
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,280
in only has an array and they re has an
object and doctor has

936
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,160
in value and divided as an array and has
an object

937
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,050
has a value you know you'd imagine this
is pretty

938
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:22,300
a a pretty complex to fuss because
there's a lot of computation

939
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:28,540
that needs to be fall all that you

940
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:35,540
I made a mistake

941
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:40,630
not quite sure where the mistake is

942
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,180
but it somewhere here but the

943
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,739
ladies that we can weekend

944
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:51,759
we can be takeover diz one is something
with them on this

945
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:55,759
is on a choice amongst the now we can
also do

946
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:58,890
lot of other clothings such as for
example

947
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,180
to this is one of my favorite once
because he allows its creativity complex

948
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,039
types of course across forgeries now

949
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,450
typical Chris a request for just so a
quite simplistic in by nature

950
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:12,440
but you know if you want to do something
more complex like for example

951
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,200
the you want to send some sort of a the

952
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,589
XML payloads to for example arm

953
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,809
SOAP service of some kind or something
like this: up that's not

954
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:27,559
doctrinal to in normal web browsers the
reason being is because

955
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,709
a 'em Nikon fool the balls to send that
sort of stuff

956
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:36,099
and not be attending the same origin
policy some stuff

957
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:41,369
but using we could be seeking actually
to the soft XP need to write a lot of

958
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:43,089
clients like coats actually

959
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:47,339
uplift the function Altium make it work
even on the brothers that'll have this

960
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,180
type of place

961
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,339
and to and ok it is another example

962
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:55,559
is very good this is a tool that is cool
Bieber and the reason

963
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,299
the reason we're oldest to it because we
also borrow use perk

964
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,890
me because this is a good talk you know
is better for the time but the fortunate

965
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,829
burp cloths for false pretty slowly

966
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:08,039
I hate ahead so that's why we're all too

967
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:12,099
but lots for files like that you know
quickly I

968
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:15,140
and he's basically you know

969
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:21,430
is the same file but you know is loaded
by JavaScript and to its really really

970
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:22,229
really quick

971
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:27,119
to note Jul function on Tina and two

972
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,039
there's a bunch of other other thinks no

973
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,979
this is kind of a Don oh yeah this is
Microsoft again

974
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:38,440
the is a they have a similar problem and

975
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,829
to again if you look at their state you
can match

976
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:45,400
discover more folded doing for example

977
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,440
what sort of stay the half you know what
is public

978
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,849
and some place to discover a minute
faces

979
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:57,219
I found out something quite interesting
I want to share with you arm

980
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:00,479
it there's a there's a lot of web sites
all their that

981
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:03,549
Pete SSL literally as a secure

982
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:09,130
HTTP so on or watch TV there's a normal
web site but we've changed to https

983
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,319
you look then and to we file spy just
gonna internet you know for some reason

984
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:19,430
to know works saw ating a got a few
minutes to wrap up

985
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:22,769
so gonna skip this

986
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:25,949
actually wrote a proxy which is cool but
I struck to see if you actually still

987
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,549
want to it's it's a free tool

988
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:31,859
a and if you want still looking to our
the sort of stuff the only difference

989
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:33,029
between this proxy

990
00:56:33,029 --> 00:56:36,130
and the normal process industry
screenshot

991
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:40,209
because I don't have it installed here
it's this hard looks like

992
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:43,349
the only difference is that what you see
here the sort

993
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:46,630
always turn on JavaScript and the whole
proxy

994
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,359
is written in such a way that there's no
buffering happening at any stage in time

995
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,569
so when you select the particular
transaction is not guaranteed the truck

996
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:56,509
she see the whole thing

997
00:56:56,509 --> 00:57:00,199
you may be seeing the whole thing he may
not be Knaus

998
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,130
you don't know you know so if it's a
large request that is 5 gigabytes or

999
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,009
something like this:

1000
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:08,440
you just see partially because they
request is still pending you know

1001
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,319
a book but there's no point in the whole
situation where we actually

1002
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,940
offered the requests 25 not the way this
thing is done

1003
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,269
is that you got a back-end server which
is written in a in node.js

1004
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:23,559
and we've got a little fuck be some
utility which is also free which school

1005
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:26,249
proxy fights like a it's a city to
c:\program

1006
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:29,569
that does the heavy lifting from the
proxy gonna be so everything's chained

1007
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:30,160
together

1008
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,809
we communicate the whole thing for
WebSockets and he's actually really

1009
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:34,489
really

1010
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:38,089
up a responsive to all kinds of changes
so this is

1011
00:57:38,089 --> 00:57:42,719
if we stick to making proxies what we
need to do is to change the way we

1012
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:45,759
we make them so instead of actually
having to sort of a buffer

1013
00:57:45,759 --> 00:57:49,269
Dane gone on with no way of your
vacation working on this

1014
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:52,289
we need to change to me the way that its
is steaming

1015
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:56,259
all the time so the proxy itself has the
function 94 St makes over

1016
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:59,430
and

1017
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,869
what is next I'll thing is that I don't
know what is next

1018
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:07,739
the Wii XD I'll in all cooperating with
the

1019
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:12,789
a lot of guys from a UK work researchers
on writing tools and stuff like this

1020
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:16,469
and wanna find and the NEX necks
expecting

1021
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:19,809
you know we fare found something that
for us is the next big things like a

1022
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:20,589
it's like a

1023
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:23,989
it's a new way of doing things but we
also working to

1024
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:27,410
on to deliver more interesting solution
so just two

1025
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,279
a bit of a secret which not gonna be
secret anymore in this is something to

1026
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:31,009
share with you

1027
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:34,449
similar to this gonna I'll come ups
gonna be related sick when gestion the

1028
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:37,719
stuff like this so you can have an
entire sequence actually farming

1029
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:40,829
now you know is almost like sicko map or
sick or ninja

1030
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:44,699
that will execute entirely from I from
the

1031
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:49,049
bills itself horse you know very very
complex workflow applications

1032
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:53,150
the for all kinds of stuff

1033
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:57,019
and I've got the ago two minutes pretty
much

1034
00:58:57,019 --> 00:59:00,839
for you if you have any questions

1035
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:05,559
any questions from the floor

1036
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:09,949
no a PDP will also be available for
these two days at the conference a few

1037
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:12,910
feet approaching directly if you have
any questions

1038
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:16,309
0 sorry

1039
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:20,049
I'm thank you for talking about

1040
00:59:20,049 --> 00:59:23,180
during your talk at this that your
foundations Karen

1041
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:28,249
very nice and manifesting how does this
legally work I just and

1042
00:59:28,249 --> 00:59:31,479
some website I knew did that was
horrible when

1043
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:35,299
who's responsible at this point for
anything that might break

1044
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:39,819
right so is a good question right I
think it's a very very good question

1045
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:44,599
and that's something that they are I I
also very few very personally

1046
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:48,390
Camino Real eighty my work right knife
city to take tools like recall

1047
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,949
for example there's no way the pic as
you could break

1048
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:55,140
on the recall because what we call it
does is a passive and analysis

1049
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:58,150
Ino you fact Google Voice probably more
intrusive

1050
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,809
in the way it's by the website you know
so it's a very very lightweight

1051
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:05,299
and he just tries to figure out was the
one abominable based on the information

1052
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:06,279
is given

1053
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:10,390
in a base on versions basil stuff like
this if you something like the scanner

1054
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:14,739
well you can just use it to guess any
website is gonna be completely a legal

1055
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:17,739
in of I mean if you break it you pretty
much responsible for

1056
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,239
you know I'm I'm pretty much sure that
most so the web sites will have to serve

1057
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:23,380
as the prohibits you from being a suffix

1058
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,440
now obvious the and he took make a
caveat where the you know if you use it

1059
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,349
if you use to test that says something
like a SharePoint web site a wordpress

1060
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:32,170
website or something like this:

1061
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,019
if you if you login with admin
credential York potentially destroy

1062
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:39,109
the site you know you delete it and
things like that now this is a problem

1063
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:41,420
that every single scanner haz

1064
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,999
and he needs to be configured our
solution to this problem is that

1065
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:47,749
because we've got this on a framework we
don't think in terms like we're gonna

1066
01:00:47,749 --> 01:00:50,299
ride the general purpose can we write
specifics gonna

1067
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:53,549
so that's why once can is that the I'm
currently working on

1068
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,999
is so what bresca and one other one
which is the SharePoint scan

1069
01:00:56,999 --> 01:01:00,019
there's no way you can break the website
under the SharePoint Scout

1070
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:03,339
because the SharePoint scan is actually
appeared in such a way that is looking

1071
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:05,589
at their SharePoint specific function
nineties

1072
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:08,989
but it's gonna test only for the
customization is ship which is a lot

1073
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:12,559
lightweight so therefore the Chasa break
it

1074
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,719
you know breaking something itself a lot
less

1075
01:01:15,719 --> 01:01:19,679
muchi this also see question

1076
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,079
impart I think and well

1077
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:26,369
this can actually happens from my IP
address from

1078
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:29,989
by you make it very easy for anybody

1079
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:34,049
out Dec 2 Finland the euro and scan it

1080
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:38,660
its you should add this passes the
grandma

1081
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,859
best I think for now anyway can actually

1082
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:45,779
just start scanning and render yeah of
course because everybody can start

1083
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:46,339
scanning

1084
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:51,009
the soda is no different than this car
situation just makes it simply enough

1085
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:54,999
you know I mean before Metasploit you
would downloading

1086
01:01:54,999 --> 01:01:58,819
you know most people watch the either
right to exploit or download it then

1087
01:01:58,819 --> 01:01:59,819
compile it and run

1088
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:04,049
tsunami enough the Metasploit everything
is pretty much a Subversion update

1089
01:02:04,049 --> 01:02:08,759
enough and then you got the tools you
know and you can just watch them

1090
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:14,420
you know you can write a simple UI that
your grandma can you see no

1091
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,150
basically we're

1092
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:24,199
out of time for questions we could take
a shot when it is anymore from the floor

1093
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:29,420
fees than it once was your

1094
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,890
I'll of course it's a client site also
the code is here

1095
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,019
I mean we can see the cold but is a
really open source like

1096
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:40,170
a bill my sons have you release that
like on get home or something

1097
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:44,849
the the a marquee it's interesting
question we've got opposite not of a

1098
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:46,359
source to snow

1099
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:49,819
Scopus source why I

1100
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:53,739
you know securities has changed quite a
bit since the the days when people were

1101
01:02:53,739 --> 01:02:54,789
doing it for the glory

1102
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:58,749
in how these days to Ino at the scene
some other presentations the actual

1103
01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:01,349
takes a lot of time to develop a proper
tool kit

1104
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:04,440
it does not something that's gonna write
in your spare time over two days

1105
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,910
you know are we can something he spent
seven years developing the concept

1106
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,410
and a new you wanna you know do
something great with it

1107
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,259
in order to do for something great would
it basically need some kind of financial

1108
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:16,199
support

1109
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:20,369
so although we want to enable tools to
be used and by the way we speaking to

1110
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,440
universities

1111
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,809
in now in the Netherlands to give it
away to students for free

1112
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:29,299
you know to use we speaking some
universities in Italy again

1113
01:03:29,299 --> 01:03:33,039
Ino although we wanna be the goods a
service Mariana swanee support the

1114
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:33,880
community

1115
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,319
for corporations and individuals there's
only one to wear the moment that is free

1116
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,979
