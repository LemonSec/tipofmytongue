1
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,050
she's

2
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,190
mineral

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,359
uh... claims processes karthick

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,729
and we're talking about security
response in the age of mass customized

5
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,090
attacks

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,960
overdue reduce their can give you a bit
introduction to work

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,210
uh... mass customization means

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,060
and that's the sensations actually
business term

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,590
uh... sorry to be a little bit of the
business background

10
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,120
but don't worry this is a hacker box
talk we are going to

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,250
show details from the exploit even
allies ng

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,950
and

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,790
do you take a look onto the cervix
peckham peckham box

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,290
the resort reserve looking at this from
business perspective though is because

15
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,190
everybody servlets a_b_c_ threats from
different angle

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,660
right if you watch a soccer game in
ninety nine one goal in carthage another

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,409
goal

18
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,539
what two completely different views of
the game you know we're watching the

19
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,880
same of that

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,500
and the security industry as we watch
you know if you tax while much of his

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,130
birth propagate the wild

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,920
this is very thing happens like eighty
people have their view from where

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,620
they're sitting vendors have

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,430
argue where we're sitting

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,790
and

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,020
uh... but taking a look at uh... at the
concept of mass customs asian business

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,060
you get different view in terms of where
exports are going that u_n_ normally get

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,320
just through technical analysis

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,830
and we can use that to inform how we we
do some of our security response because

30
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,340
certain businesses

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,260
involve in certain ways regardless of
the product they're selling

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,190
so

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,440
weekend

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,020
we expect

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,490
easier day

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,150
uh... commercialization although certain
business trends

37
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,960
uh... please you know stick with us
there is definitely technical content

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,540
packed with majority of this
presentation is technical content per

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,600
and start to get here

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,460
a brief intro into

41
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,069
at what it means

42
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,590
for background president i both work

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,839
uh... as per adobe's past courteous
response team beaufort

44
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,489
art students a response team copy cert

45
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,729
so if you send is your day

46
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,609
uh... to dubey

47
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,209
either he or i will be the first ones to
analyze it

48
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,699
uh... so we have spell our time with
these are days where the people that

49
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,579
take a look at

50
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,949
at these attacks

51
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,849
uh... that squash player to do any of
its readers usually karthik uh... in

52
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,429
some cases we've both jumpin work on it
princess in the readers here they were

53
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,179
served racing each other

54
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:42,709
to uh...

55
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,239
deceived analyzer first use of personal
comfort shin

56
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,589
uh... but basically at with people find
softness in the end of the search

57
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:52,489
covault so crosses you would expect for

58
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:54,649
for most companies in terms of

59
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:58,629
uh... coming in to us you create
tracking number either back to you

60

uh... if you haven't had a every
situation with us please buy this

61
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,049
afterwards

62
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,049
uh... when have you talked about

63
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,199
uh... and we also work with at the
larger team called asset which is

64
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,269
the practice team with adobe that were
surprising secre fixes what we've done

65
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:15,659
the analysis

66
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,079
uh... market researchers verified
published bolton's

67
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,680
uh... we're partner in the mid mike soft
active protection program for

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,010
getting on the bill the information out
to be denied yes anderson

69
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,189
the ideas please

70
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:31,269
uh... part of what we're doing you know
we're doing this research we're looking

71
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,089
at the easier it is from february

72
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,959
is now it's in your account technically
crafted

73
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,849
we also trying to figure out what we can
learn from them

74
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:41,899
in terms of

75
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,909
that we could feed back into our are
secured on the life cycle processes

76
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,329
toots mix offer better

77
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,469
so now measure everything over the
karthick he's injured in the background

78
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,569
on

79
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,729
uh... masterson zation

80
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,699
articles

81
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,939
every lawyer reflect

82
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,859
to the first part of the stock is uh...
spots of business concepts and uh... the

83
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,689
trams were seeing in uh... export
creation

84
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,679
we think are related to some of these
business concepts of let's begin with

85
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,059
mass customization

86
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,959
uh... was best customization

87
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,819
leviticus you before we get started

88
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:20,089
sexy concept attributed to stanley davis
a business consultant and uh... former

89
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,340
business professor at harvard columbia
in boston university

90
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,939
he first pages this concept in a book in
nineteen eighty seven the title the book

91
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,919
is future perfect

92
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,360
so heavy defined

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,560
mass customization

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,650
were defined as the customization

95
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,389
and personalized asian of products and
services for an individual customer

96
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:40,550
at a mass production price

97
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,090
another way of saying that is a
effectively postponing the past uh...

98
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,879
differentiating the product

99
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,379
for specific customer until the latest
possible point

100
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,009
in supplier network

101
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,000
traditionally customization

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,639
and low-cost have been usually exclusive

103
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,930
mass production was cheap but it didn't
go hand-in-hand with customization and

104
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,330
customization was the mainstay of
product designers

105
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,979
and craftsman

106
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,520
so let's look at a classic example uh...
from the automobile industry to

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,629
understand

108
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:11,339
mass customization

109
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,639
mass production and customization a
little better

110
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,979
and his example comes from

111
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,729
the ford model t

112
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,310
there are many of the same time

113
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,669
with little or no variation

114
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,900
uh... and henry ford is uh... famously

115
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,139
uh... such as that

116
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,559
but model fee you could have any color
card what as long as it's black

117
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:35,210
now contrasted the uh...

118
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,159
massive numbers of replicas of the model
t_

119
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,530
is a different kind of example this is a
a custom replica

120
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,210
of a cutting from an auto show

121
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,979
what's different here is that

122
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,749
there is not uh... there is not the
houses are millions of copies would

123
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,399
rather just ahead

124
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,460
as an example customer's issue in
contrast a mass production in a multi

125
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,529
and other business consultant joseph
pine discusses the spread of mass

126
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:00,719
customization

127
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,139
into other industries on this book
entitled mass customization

128
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,069
it can to example have mass
customization entered the financial

129
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:08,879
industry

130
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,440
now with your a_t_m_ card we could go to
any bank

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,669
what was in the world

132
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,169
experience customer service from your
financial institution

133
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,559
which is only one of thousands

134
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,379
eligible here have designer on p_c_s
luzia

135
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,809
children some of the people of design
their own pcs

136
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,660
uh... but twenty percent

137
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,689
so that's an example of mass
customization in then the pc

138
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,930
hardware industry as well

139
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,729
cd designer pc

140
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,929
from apply different companies from a
lot of different suppliers

141
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:41,539
so it's a business idea mass
customization uh... unified automobiles

142
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,660
manufacturing

143
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,220
electron ics analyst really goes on

144
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,910
and that the premise of this talk of
closing argument is that this trend

145
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,809
uh... we can say is now applying to
explode creation

146
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,369
what we're seeing is that

147
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:57,449
the beginning of massive our becoming
mass customized attacks

148
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,949
and the rest of the stock market

149
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,620
give you a bit of evidence that thinks
that that shows that the strain is

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,089
beginning

151
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:05,990
art

152
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,889
so let's let's cover whether groundless
view should be familiar with this

153
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,179
already but uh...

154
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,400
mass mahler is an example of something
that's that's mass-produced and uh...

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
like most of you know uh... some
examples of export case includes black

156
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,740
hole phoenix

157
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,699
anticrime package eleanor

158
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,309
uh... course exported support local
browsers multiple versions of browsers

159
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,240
and uh...

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,199
different versions of parkinson java
doing reader to view flash

161
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,909
uh... anything about exploit kits is
that they're very much for

162
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:37,909
you know you could have a few you you're
the back i was making these export kids

163
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:41,999
you create a new module and and plug it
in its plug-and-play for any module

164
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:46,199
and not only are are that modules that
that uh... induced a crash and uh...

165
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,479
divert code

166
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,180
execution modular but also the payloads

167
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,839
so whatever's delivered to a victim upon
successful compromises also modular

168
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,029
uh... either not one of the uh... the
the ideas irda exploits being repurposed

169
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,169
as modules

170
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,430
uh... comes from gabriel's exploit algis
projects lots of useful reference if

171
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,029
anyone is interested

172
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,219
but it's a export kits can be served
from anywhere and them our that's uh...

173
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,819
served on successful compromise could
also come from anywhere

174
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,729
the relatively cheap in the order of two
thousand dollars

175
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,719
at this time we agreed that new criminal
enterprises organized groups are gangs

176
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,389
are behind these things just last week
there was a

177
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,969
uh... history on cd net about the
hackers behind the uh... harper partner

178
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,650
uh... who were arrested so it's an
organized group that's uh... points out

179
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,260
that the business

180
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,340
over that long

181
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,180
this paper by covert at all attacks on
the of office getting transformations is

182
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,010
a wonderful reference on

183
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:42,800
office kitchen

184
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,310
and it provides a common terminology for
discussing office kitchen

185
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,920
so these guys provide three
characteristics

186
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,240
uh... concerning the quality of office
kitchen transformations

187
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,560
and we'll discuss these and life of the
office cations we see in mass malware

188
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,550
and which we do not see and targeted tax

189
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,250
so what are these characteristics one
couldn't see

190
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,570
this refers to the degree to which and
analyst who's diaz is getting exported

191
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,500
frustrated

192
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,320
second resilience this refers to the
resistance automatic the office kitchen

193
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
of exploits

194
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,330
and third cost

195
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,600
this is the overhead to the application
of the suspected skin to cover the

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,480
tricky

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,800
concept uh... to grow up but uh... let's
say uh...

198
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,420
export covers mobile different versions
of application

199
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,890
in terms of this terminology the cost of
the application would be high

200
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,990
so you hear me refer to uh... allow
these from knology

201
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,650
uh... in the coming side so it's good to
keep these three terms in mind

202
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,790
now on another axis um... in contrast
the colbert terminology

203
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,840
but you just look at basic pick your
characteristics of next week

204
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,230
doesn't support mobile operating systems

205
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,340
local kinds of payloads multiple service
packs

206
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,830
this is more common discussion industry

207
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,290
and how complex is the office kitchen

208
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,210
somalia walk-through

209
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,920
uh... the process of diaz a skating

210
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,130
appease them our cv twenty ten

211
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,040
there one kate did which according to
the contagion our top is found and all

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,940
those different kinds of export kits

213
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,830
does a pretty good example represented
example of the characteristics en masse

214
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,830
malware

215
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,420
um... that are indicative of complexity
and and uh... obfuscation

216
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,680
elections for president learned that
uh... despite this export being almost

217
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,790
three years old

218
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,170
section of the most common exports to
wean adobe pc receipt

219
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,730
on a regular basis

220
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,470
so it's a representative sample

221
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,779
so if you recall her dolls paper he goes
through

222
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,330
so difficult that terminology to uh...
to describe him

223
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,790
and capital correctly the types of
office kitchen

224
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,870
j_v_c_ some

225
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,860
variable names being split

226
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,080
uh... scattered all over the place so
there's there's day office cation uh...

227
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,880
there's a little bit of lay-up
confiscation because it's hard to read

228
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,480
the code so let's call this layer one
right so if you spent a little bit of

229
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,240
time

230
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,289
within a javascript debugger

231
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,070
you can arrive at something like this

232
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,250
it's a little more readable basically
the same tells rewritten

233
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,190
uh... some of the variables are renamed

234
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,350
javascript is normalized and the layout
is a lot more friendly to avert reading

235
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,020
it

236
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,150
and from from this representation

237
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,769
it's possible for us to induce or
deduced easily

238
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:16,990
so kinda functionality

239
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,810
usko salir too

240
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,490
took part of the what the export is
doing is clear button what knowledge

241
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,810
so we've got a continued the office
kitchen

242
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,880
let's go this layer three so we get to
this where there's a for field name

243
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,710
who's

244
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,540
uh... whose purpose is isn't known gotta
continue chiapas station to get to the

245
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,440
bottom with the six was doing

246
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,590
and we continue down that path you
relate to other variables looks like a

247
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,890
string of uh... hexadecimal numbers

248
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,910
was out there

249
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,620
spend more time on a at the later five

250
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,540
art so quietly you know you you spent a
bit of time on this

251
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,160
it difficult to five layers of office
kitchen

252
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
and uh... it's not clear what is what is
its export to excel

253
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,670
uh... interest rates for it with some
some chocolate

254
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,769
and then there's a variable niles an
easy uh... was that

255
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,790
so within deductible object model of
uh... just opened tedious it's possible

256
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,600
for variables to reference other parts
of the ppm

257
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,060
at your only analyzing this train

258
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,690
uh... there was no other reference to
any z

259
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,400
soviet is he was actually variable that
was from a different part from different

260
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,270
strain

261
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,339
in the top

262
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:28,240
and and that's where uh... tiff image
which was triggered a book and reader

263
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,550
was being loaded from so they keep it
been prime which also

264
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,770
and then a different part of the the
p_f_ was invoked a lotus to finish which

265
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,250
cracked crash leader

266
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,819
and uh... win control of flow to the
chocolate so

267
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,810
it's a to relatively complex uh...

268
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,140
exporting to reverse engineer but

269
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,530
dick sweat file here so

270
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,390
in kohlberg ulster margin you would say
that this is a highly potent and

271
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,040
resulted exploit

272
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,990
dot so we just looked at the technical

273
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,240
walk-through of cv twenty to answer what
he did was that tell us about

274
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,950
mass production

275
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,820
export kits

276
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,140
you could say

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,890
or specialized machines with barry
sanders changeable parts

278
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,350
and example we just saw cv twenty does
he want haiti

279
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,890
you could say that isn interchangeable
parts

280
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,420
within any kind of export kit

281
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,860
because it anywhere answer mahler from
anywhere

282
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,380
as low-cost partly because

283
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,550
uh... the module for the export can be
changed and i again the exploited houses

284
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,690
project is it

285
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,140
is good reference for that

286
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,870
some of the contrast everything i tell
you about the features of mass lower by

287
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,509
giving an example of the target is early
attack

288
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,560
talking with some of the features that
are unique

289
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,760
to that kind of attack

290
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,140
so back in december of twenty eleven
uh... weirdo vacations were sent

291
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,739
malicious pitiful

292
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,160
by a partner

293
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,370
and the company message which is
something like

294
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,100
looks like is their day

295
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,310
uh... crashes rate of nine four six so
at the time you turn on for six was the

296
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,770
most current version of reader and uh...
when when analyzing bushes p_b_s_ if

297
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,780
something is affecting the most current
version of your platform that's which

298
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,230
are most concerned with

299
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,410
right so we took about their two
brothers exploit uh... there is some

300
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,790
uh... tickets free stuff going on not
very complex yet because they smoke

301
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,590
wouldn't see

302
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,250
there was some variable renaming so
wasn't immediately clear with the

303
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,690
control flow was

304
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,670
however which is the single line of
uh... uh... pearland train matching

305
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,549
replacing

306
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,480
you can easily get past that level of
office kitchen

307
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,880
and so it is to give you say there's
just one layer of obfuscation ats look

308
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,020
for dancing in the loop resilience

309
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,380
effect out conjecture that

310
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,890
this little office kitchen was just
enough

311
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,879
to bypass teristics checks and have ours
at the time

312
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,819
and there's no need to over engineer
this export

313
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:51,290
to go past any other kind of haiti

314
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,380
well about version checking

315
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,850
when it features a massive our that will
talk about the cost

316
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,060
is proportional to the number of
versions that are supported by

317
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,840
competition

318
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,079
at first i think it may seem like this
targeted tax support smoke will purchase

319
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,150
but the fact

320
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,760
that's not the case

321
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,160
were the first people matsu lividity
independent researcher

322
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,590
to also uh... take apart this exploit
uh... brenda dickson

323
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,000
he said something like like most
javascript served in other malicious

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,800
files

325
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,080
checks are done for the proper version
number performing routines are executed

326
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,960
what is interesting about this document
is at the church diversions that do not

327
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,080
exist and makes a point to redirect the
user to an infinite loop assuming

328
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,530
they're running a version greater than
ten

329
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,900
so it's a to recap that

330
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,930
there wasn't too much complex office
cation

331
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,630
in a way to get spring was done

332
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,480
and then only a particular version of
rigor was targeted the latest version of

333
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,330
the year

334
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,120
nine at that time

335
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,170
in conclusion

336
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,470
thus export contain features of the
target sort it out

337
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,440
and uh... the people wrote this export
perhaps did not need to support other

338
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,130
versions of reader because the
organization they were going after uh...

339
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,529
was only running certainly turnitin
there is no

340
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:07,070
economically or otherwise to the target
reader ten

341
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,209
so my head back to posts and uh... we're
getting a discussion of

342
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,310
feature specific to are considered the
apex

343
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,750
sorry thus far have been talking about
readers here it is the it's in the wild

344
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,580
uh... but the features a karthick at
this has described parliamentary here we

345
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,960
see this another

346
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,540
now or that we analyze for instance this
is from sea beach wayland cleantech

347
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,990
that's when when ten

348
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,560
and this was a flash players their day

349
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,660
that uh... we dealt with in twenty levin

350
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,490
and they had a couple uh... internal
parts to it

351
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,950
the first was that the your l for the
payload was passed in this is not the

352
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,170
skids train

353
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,010
uh... to this with so they could re
purposes flip over and over again with

354
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,610
different religious by

355
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,090
are changing variable that they pass and
do it

356
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,150
um... and they also

357
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,630
i did version check and make sure that
they are worked most recent versions of

358
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,730
three uh... flash player

359
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,790
so eg

360
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,790
these these techniques can be seen a lot
different hour if you look through it's

361
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,770
it's fairly common for a lot of

362
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,270
other groups

363
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,620
uh... so it was the difference here for
mass customs issue most of these things

364
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,460
here to do all parts

365
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,140
the opposition those are things that are
event mass production you can see those

366
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,300
in our

367
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,010
but whether the things that actually did

368
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,910
uh... make this malware

369
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,289
in these attacks

370
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,600
classifieds mass customs asian

371
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,590
ant

372
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,670
this table here is

373
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,100
uh... from just the pines book and ask
us ionisation talks about

374
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,810
uh... features we could have landscape
of nineteen nineties

375
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,530
help drive mass customization

376
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,100
uh... whether those was cycle time
reduction

377
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,530
uh... another one was quick response

378
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,500
uh... wanted things that need to go for
mass production team asked customs ation

379
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,890
is the need to be able the meet customer
needs faster

380
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,940
right with mass production invites up to
you

381
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,830
to a large number of people but they all
get the same box

382
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,710
like you to go into if you're into a
gross beyonce's

383
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,410
store

384
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,140
whatever's on the shelf is what you get
lucifer from desktop p_c_ market where

385
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,000
you can sit there and every person order
their own version of

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,650
of their dell pc here

387
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,799
gateway pc

388
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,559
uh... we'd be able to provide people
with the customize response and much

389
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,960
quicker rate

390
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,410
and his security industry where the
things that's been happening on the

391
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,820
defensive side

392
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,960
is the need to turn things over more
quickly

393
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,430
this is a graph from

394
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,409
that covers all they'll be products in
terms of

395
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,860
our response time too

396
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,029
obama abilities are reported to us

397
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,970
uh...

398
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,460
back in two thousand eight we're are
ever trust company was around two to

399
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,539
five days

400
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:41,350
and now we have the driven down to under
fourteen days for

401
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,480
preserved a response time said the

402
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,840
uh... zero days eckardt in february they
were dealing with the three partners

403
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,609
here it is that the readers your day

404
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:52,799
although israel dst around lesson
fourteen days

405
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,049
in addition to that

406
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,659
the bilby for us to distribute patches

407
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,140
to a large customer base is also
increased

408
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,380
presence within flash player we have a
background updated now

409
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,820
that background updater will check for
updates every single day

410
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,840
so

411
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,970
young yesterday we refresh up actually
had to come down fix

412
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,890
uh... from cancer quest

413
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,160
and

414
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,669
private industry pour all flying home

415
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,620
uh... right up three quarters of

416
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,620
of the people around plus we'll have a
patch of dirt

417
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,920
during the background updater

418
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,160
so what we've done this for the people i
create asp our kids

419
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,430
those surveys have a much shorter shelf
life

420
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,420
friday

421
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,580
your zero base

422
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,190
it's much harder for those ear days have
effective ur longer period of time

423
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,200
because vendors responding quicker

424
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,370
and we're also shipping updates to to
end users faster

425
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,020
so

426
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,240
that's research gets is this mass
customs ation idea

427
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,409
where

428
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:55,710
you have the platform yep you basically
have these frameworks for delivering

429
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,410
exploits the customers in the they have
their changeable charts you can

430
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,720
you can dynamically passing payloads you
can cheese which office cation technique

431
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,270
you want to be able to use

432
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,630
uh... you have been

433
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,500
so michelle codes of your size for
different versions

434
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,610
and now a cd mass production a busier
days to get them out there

435
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,610
uh... your crime where kids

436
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,220
for the people are their marketing these
are days

437
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,060
they need to be able to be mascots
ionisation maybe able to plug in

438
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,059
your day exploits

439
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,240
and fairly rapid basis so that they can
do to turn over they need

440
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,220
such that

441
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,620
customers uh...

442
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,370
can get exploits working

443
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,669
and much faster rate

444
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,030
because he says i give to one guy in nyc
i gets caught

445
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,210
zero days bird

446
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,800
so i i get another zeroed after visit
difference here did get to my other

447
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,960
customer

448
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,039
because

449
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,630
the first one got burnt and i need a
little over a fairly quickly

450
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,990
uh... so if we take a look at

451
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,840
icb ex-wife thirteen a six to three did

452
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,080
never send it to zero days that

453
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,590
i were in february

454
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,490
there's a lot of attacks going on
february there are three different plus

455
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,460
players their days in arrears their day
all within the very short period of time

456
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,140
uh... not sure who was mad at you but
they're definitely shoot each other and

457
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,800
vigil work for a game

458
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,640
uh... this one was plus square

459
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,930
up other buildings on the first ones we
patch

460
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,370
andrews of is attack against box

461
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,640
uh... the

462
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,970
they found the fun parsing bowed uh...
if i called diablo

463
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,250
and the exploit that and flash player

464
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,840
they had some of the things you would
expect mass-produced swim for they have

465
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,700
diversion checking their

466
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,120
and they have a compound

467
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,140
uh... they have things working down to
punch another aspect it

468
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,850
a mass production so

469
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,460
if you look at the shelter care and if
you look at the action script code here

470
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,130
big it got there layout of the attacked
her lol segmented they have bill drop

471
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,710
their build shelled code

472
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,620
him every applicant react

473
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,350
a lot of these functions get repurposed
saliva lots with sealed

474
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,480
you'll see them from from time to time

475
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,590
and

476
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,120
the part that

477
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,380
as pacific to desert is basically looked
a lot of fun

478
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,510
uh... because that was with the need for
this particular instance absurd

479
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,370
see-saw have those uh... a return to
parts for mass production along with

480
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,289
verde attacks

481
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,539
another one that we dealt with became an
almost exact same time was cv twenty

482
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,260
thirty of sixty four

483
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,179
this is known as the lady boil attack

484
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,200
and this was really really interesting

485
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,870
i in terms of its overall sophistication
is definitely

486
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,559
the working uh... people that you what
they were doing

487
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,900
taking the time to kiwi and everything

488
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,460
and creating a truly vicious uh...

489
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,660
so

490
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,640
one of the things that uh... it uses
this is the exploit that used

491
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,280
uh... the doctor he trade methodology
that hiked a labor

492
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,900
route a paper on

493
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,180
on the campus newspaper and it was just
read it

494
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,809
it was a if they're a complex relatively
new

495
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:03,490
uh... method for doing keeps raising
flash player

496
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,050
attacking part was relatively new i was
able to tie it back to one swept from

497
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,679
twenty twelve sector in the navy group
you liked it

498
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,170
site accident or

499
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,510
uh... the same technique was used in
twenty four fifty fifty four

500
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,220
fidelity that's only when they recall it
being used in and i wasn't used to say

501
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,070
we're doing extra exploits

502
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,220
uh... this was the first five square
exploiting the six and a half years i

503
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,070
did do a b_ where there was easier day
found in the wild that was actually

504
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,750
turning max

505
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,360
so they were targeted either firefox or
safari imac

506
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,190
you're able to

507
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,080
test at their if it was on windows to be
delivered in office document

508
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,870
that bothersome something new their
uh... this came out just before we

509
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,919
release foot to play for office for
flash player

510
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,039
now if uh... kevin recent version of
flash player

511
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:51,170
and and office document tracy
instantiate

512
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,610
we throw the dialogue saying hey we're
not as chances are this wasn't

513
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,880
what you meant to do you please click
close

514
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,510
uh... trade block office taxact com as
means to build rinpoche exploits but

515
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,399
this came out right before it sanders
window version delivered via office

516
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,530
documents

517
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,690
payloads on it

518
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,240
ross a fairly sophisticated

519
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,120
they had

520
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,080
different payloads embedded in the
square for both thirty two-bit sixty

521
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,950
four-bit operating systems

522
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,950
and two thirds of that version

523
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,580
was actually digitally signed

524
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,630
uh... from bay

525
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,299
certification by five resigned to it
regaining company

526
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,169
it was actually out of date

527
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,050
those still visually signed by some but
thought so

528
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,590
uh... they bothered decided payloads

529
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,190
psa uh...

530
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,290
as you can see from this attack actually

531
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,600
spent a pretty decent out time coming up
with something that

532
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,910
works where every sentence furthers mac
or windows

533
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,830
additionally sign payloads to try to
bypass as maybe checks

534
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,780
uh... they accounted for different
architectures for thirteen sixty

535
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,990
four-bit

536
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,179
this was somebody who who's spent a lot
of time

537
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,630
uh... working this working that's out
making its first kid

538
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,970
and when i see it supported windows

539
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,820
and just mean xp vista and when seven

540
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,630
they actually made it work for windows
server versions

541
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,529
so its word server two thousand three
seven two two thousand three or two

542
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:14,610
server two thousand eight server two
thousand eight thirty

543
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,360
also in terms of plus playwright a
support export wa six persons a flash

544
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,600
player

545
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,750
and this is interesting because

546
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,700
uh... at right now we're shipping plus
for updates once a month that's her car

547
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,810
currents uh...

548
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,110
goes to

549
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,160
ripper coelho much bucks or shipping
things someone's let's month scale

550
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,810
that's way have three different versions
of one up for three different versions

551
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,360
eleven up five

552
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,059
uh... so in order for somebody to right
felt good to be able to test insult

553
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:41,930
versions

554
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,080
you have to keep up to date right you
have to you

555
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,290
make sure you keep copies of the every
month ago download the latest flash

556
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,430
player version keeping up the around

557
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,360
you have to have

558
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,650
bme set up to do the matrices of all
these different combinations

559
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,190
discussed in this environment

560
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,800
said most will be m setups natured
stable and any configuration that's

561
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,330
discipline

562
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,730
and so

563
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,770
um... if you're used to

564
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,029
the idea like a diverse ever worked as a
consultant you've done consultants uh...

565
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:11,830
you prefer companies of the rights backs
and had answers

566
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,789
looking kelvin in for what the spec
lines

567
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,789
right and from looking at the cd
actually look at

568
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,780
look at that was to support versions and
say

569
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,480
are eight somebody can declare customer
requirement

570
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,740
uh... from whether customers at the
sport all versions of windows

571
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,200
because otherwise why would you support
foster and server

572
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,570
well houston office documents to you

573
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,420
two square windows server version is out
and that made people opening malicious

574
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,140
email attachments from windows server

575
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,960
you know if the customer requests all
versions of windows you make sure it

576
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,050
supports all versions of windows and so
that's a still all the windows server

577
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,690
versions as well

578
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,750
so very sophisticated tak

579
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,320
uh... that we saw we spent some time

580
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,330
analyzing

581
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,920
beter foursquare budget review is in
february

582
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,950
in just two months ago was uh... reader
ansari prosperity b_-twenty three

583
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,150
tweeter t

584
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:09,530
i succeed by the size of the readers
their day

585
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,840
so wondered about three of your was

586
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,050
uh... the readers are dead

587
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,409
and

588
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,990
it was very complicated and that's not
just one box set is skipped the sandbox

589
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,760
ands

590
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,100
uh... so they had more than one bugged
danielle actually harder for us to test

591
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,840
as we have to test both uh... original
passage was a sandbox uske

592
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,590
uh... one buffer overflow them when
informationweek

593
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,260
and they have the sandbox uske

594
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,490
sos stall of three bugs that we had to
go through

595
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,490
and pull out the sheltered from that

596
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,900
and test the patterns for each one of
those

597
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,940
uh... is made

598
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,460
so it will be more time terms now also
schism subduing one but if there were

599
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,230
three budget three different layers of
of execution

600
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,590
uh...

601
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,210
and just was heavily office kid

602
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,539
and now let's uh...

603
00:27:58,539 --> 00:27:59,950
prototype epistle of it

604
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,260
sewers

605
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,240
some brief

606
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,250
so that's a switch uh... so much else
were from the export and uh... you know

607
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,200
very complex high potency high zillions

608
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,980
there was some variable name rewriting

609
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,530
and has with some of the target is there
detective was possible to

610
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,880
uh... you some prospecting to get
through that layer however it was a

611
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,299
comprehensive and and they were still a
lot of

612
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,120
uh... layers of uh...

613
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
diversity hearing in the debugging

614
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,269
uh... to beat dot at that point

615
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:34,540
was interesting was uh... a lot of air
balloons uh... was devil

616
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,039
you pay attention to the other

617
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,490
uh... five sorted the font thing though
that that was the awful

618
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,930
at this point postmaster to the weather
which call the exorcist ur

619
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,260
continue debug to debug it

620
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,370
and of course uh... the six point used

621
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,040
opal uh... readers and it features

622
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,750
and this was a record in terms of how
many different kinds of versions of the

623
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,370
year

624
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,240
were supported so edition of the edition
to the uh... particularly

625
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,729
what product versions

626
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:02,859
there's also some versions with three
different languages arabic creek and

627
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:04,019
hebrew

628
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,450
uh... and uh...

629
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,880
versions ranging from nine which uh...
polish doesn't have a sandbox attend

630
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,390
which does have a sandbox eleven which
has a two percent box all supported

631
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,560
and all those folks that post talked
about the informationweek

632
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,700
uh... crash amazon box by passport
change effectively for all three for all

633
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,170
these versions of uh... fixed-point

634
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,869
so we drove back to post to talk about
the fort circuit we had to contend with

635
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:35,580
and uh... incidently reserve is a big
presented in the order in which we

636
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,049
so

637
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,320
is very impressive that

638
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,400
separator sandbox escape

639
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,880
uh... to serve in general because it was
the first uh... redirects zero day we

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,580
had seen two years

641
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,210
aikman karthick head

642
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,480
talked earlier about them the ones that
we've seen the most of these from twenty

643
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,600
ten is because is the first reserve in
the wild and over two years

644
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,450
uh... so they'd be spent some time
actually crafting it

645
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,340
the right after we got the cd twenty
thirteen oh six parade

646
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,960
aunt this was a flash players in boxes
so we had some oxes

647
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,340
for flash player and chrome and firefox

648
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,980
and muse protecting those in explorer

649
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,240
uh... so this was a pleasure mocks
escape targeting firefox

650
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,410
and again uh... this book was a little
interesting in that that we think we

651
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,900
caught in the wild

652
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,450
uh... on that we the person reported to
us because wild

653
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,659
servos still under development because
in all the parts were quite there yet

654
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:32,840
uh... in terms of

655
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,059
of what was there but there is enough
there to verify that they did have

656
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,100
easier than that

657
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,780
uh... there is not there for us actually
issued patents for it

658
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,420
there is life into a cylinder
developments does not be targeted one

659
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,910
single version of flash player

660
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,040
so i think that was the version of watch
where the guy helen's machine used in

661
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,149
the development with

662
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,460
and heat

663
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,140
adding spurgeon support for uh... five
persons by love come mex stage

664
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,020
can get working for someone version that
extend out

665
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,200
uh... billy targeted firefox

666
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,600
um... because those have oxes are
different between the differ browsers

667
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,320
and so much for years and

668
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,980
in firefox is different than the one we
use the groom's different than what we

669
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,440
used for protecting

670
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,390
on saturday disembark ski cap ticket
which browser into after taking sides

671
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,830
uh... universal different browsers

672
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,590
the action script for a supported n_s_a_
chrome

673
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,269
math

674
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:25,870
operant firefox

675
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,799
served actual initial shell code you
know

676
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,240
that for

677
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,740
gain control inside the sandbox

678
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,860
they were developing out to be
university working all browsers

679
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,549
uh... we only found one that had the
fire trucks and buses texas is a budget

680
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,770
they're trying to be resolved craft work
for all all all browsers including

681
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,180
prominent

682
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,419
they're facing it together with the
sandbox escape bad

683
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:52,210
one that we found was so much skip for
firefox

684
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,330
uh... is a fairly complicated so that in
order to get to work

685
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,990
in order to uh...

686
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,720
this is not a tactic delivering office
document because our party to have a web

687
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,900
page in twenty two different slips

688
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,580
uh... as per the attack

689
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,149
and partha each print etc used

690
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:11,550
so this was uh... going be deployed via
the web because you'd be able to

691
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,460
sadness setup

692
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,470
uh... the accuser vindication that
people are saying that you so much the

693
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,070
skates is trying to deploy multiple bugs

694
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,000
uh... that particular

695
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,240
cv either way to go to sam box wasn't by
finding

696
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,440
about him plus player with the
discipline in other product

697
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,409
uh... that suffer from flash player

698
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,170
and they have all the building that and
then they got out that way

699
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,220
so

700
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,530
uh... it was also a fairly interesting
exploit in that they're at the same

701
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,690
issue multi product is

702
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,570
attacks

703
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,360
where they're combining bugs

704
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,289
from different products different
vendors

705
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:51,399
to be able to secret explicitly need
it's not just like one self-contained

706
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,640
bubble where it's completely all

707
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,220
inside watch where to put the onsite
reader is trying to mix and that's what

708
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,810
that guy

709
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:04,170
isn't sexist section we've covered the
difference here it is an example that up

710
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,620
some additional events commercialization
that you can see

711
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,789
uh... india talk i use the phrase a_t_t_
if even industry for a while you know

712
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,249
that you can see service overused term
with

713
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:17,860
sort of a definition

714
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,300
if you're going to do with media as a
frazy throughout to explain how you got

715
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,510
attacked

716
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,420
if you're selling something this is the
magic threat that the security which it

717
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,610
will protect you from

718
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,290
but when the interesting things that it
will be interesting quotes i have from

719
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,240
some of that as talking to her for three
layer agency

720
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,480
was he basically concerned abt

721
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,050
but any attack at malta program manager

722
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,469
exactly a guy group of people we've got
program manager driving it

723
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:48,059
dev goals and objectives and timelines

724
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,039
uh... excedrin

725
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,040
ads

726
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,850
from the sports here it is that we've
looked at you can see evidences of

727
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,780
begun evidence of product manager

728
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,520
your if u if you look at the code in usa
trade-in for back with the spec was

729
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,029
there in the code

730
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,720
i you can see requirements like support
all versions of reader

731
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,349
the readers your data karthick talked
about scored twelve different versions

732
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,079
including uh...

733
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,919
sub versions for different like yours

734
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,299
uh... spring all versions of windows
even the server version

735
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:20,589
may not be practical to explicitly is
running server two thousand three

736
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:24,909
they sail versions of windows squirrel
versions of windows

737
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,709
all coverage of the flash

738
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:29,459
uh... spring all browsers firefox hawaii

739
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:30,320
opera

740
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,800
right you can see inserted reflect out
the players uh... the phillies server in

741
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,459
the specs are things

742
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:39,099
and the publication behind these
explosives

743
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:40,109
by getting more

744
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,159
uh... is growing as well like the
slammer worm i think

745
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,409
does not like three hundred seventy six
bytes total zoe prints and six bytes

746
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,000
uh... the reader zero day when perfect
i'm going through that

747
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,719
uses javascript portion

748
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,220
not the the c code for the shell code

749
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,709
in the same way that went behind that

750
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:02,419
just the javascript going to the
javascript off obfuscation

751
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,859
uh... depending on how you

752
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:06,229
deal of carriage returns in javascript
code

753
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,140
it was roughly uh... it's nine thousand
ones

754
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,009
just jumped

755
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,749
two to set up the heat

756
00:35:12,749 --> 00:35:14,509
and

757
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:17,710
get everything ready so that you could
then do the shell killed by air

758
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,299
of the attack and it is simply layer of
the attack

759
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:26,249
isola spent some time developing that
players because

760
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:30,739
that doctor karadzic you because unlike
the easy javascript code either

761
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:33,799
right cuz you're trying to be memory
manipulation doing things laid out

762
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,980
referencing things the document model

763
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,250
this isn't just like the imported jquery

764
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,459
and account for like

765
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,099
ten thousand wants this is

766
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:42,639
uh... hand-written

767
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,549
uh... office dated

768
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:46,629
i've heard that they put together

769
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:50,869
and i look at these were things i
sometimes thing about this

770
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,640
as the complexity of all this gross as
they start writing

771
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,369
ex-police suspects like a lot of people
are familiar with this this cartoon

772
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:59,749
about how software development happens

773
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,599
uh...

774
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,609
where you know

775
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:06,189
this is what the customer needed this is
how the customer explained it

776
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:10,229
uh... this is how the project was
described right like every live people

777
00:36:10,229 --> 00:36:13,479
of releasing this this graphic you begin
to wonder

778
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,649
effete officially development

779
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:18,909
uh... becomes this this complex where
there were convinced backs in their

780
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,819
they're having my model products and

781
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:24,429
uh... is is what's gonna happen see to
group in the companies they're actually

782
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:26,949
doing this time

783
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,079
professionally

784
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,979
area end up with like twenty four seven
customersupport hotlines for group in

785
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:32,879
writes like

786

00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:55,739
you're starting to to expose the serb
look like means

792
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,779
also looking towards a future

793
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:00,399
uh... as i said uh... talk

794
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:02,629
if you understand the business
traveler's he would get from business

795
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:04,239
perspective you can actually

796
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,160
use that to try to uh... come up with
some conclusions about how you change we

797
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,530
do things technically

798
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,830
how do you change a response within your
company

799
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,939
which can be coming down the road

800
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:15,159
because

801
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:18,719
all businesses or if all the same model
regardless of the widget they're selling

802
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,869
weathers and exploit or to chair our car

803
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:23,859
they'll go through the same evolution

804
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,519
when it comes to you

805
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,119
uh... to business development

806
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,069
so what sorts of future was that

807
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:30,259
was at noon with

808
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:33,019
was all this mean other than the
intended interesting

809
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,430
uh... way of looking at things

810
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,560
i think one of the things are in
caesar's he more focused attacks grouper

811
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,129
services will be now where

812
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:42,679
in the past reader flash player were

813
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,349
targets of choice because

814
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:48,409
uh... the dignity of the software right
microsoft i was very vigorous everyone

815
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,969
that mark suffer while

816
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:52,169
it's marked up to her that they were
after

817
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:56,179
uh... washburn reader because we had
ubiquity

818
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:59,289
but if you have all the small grows a
shit you have the ability to turn on c_

819
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:00,509
ritika

820
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:04,109
uh... fairly quickly you can do this
urge speedy response

821
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:07,249
and you have all the parts and to meet
you can assemble suffer really quickly

822
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:10,900
going after larger young going after
smaller targets they don't have the same

823
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,240
ubiquity in the market

824
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,489
becomes much easier

825
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:17,359
it's just there changeable component
that point so

826
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,259
uh... for instance and you know there's
a flash players here day that the

827
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,929
targeted max

828
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:25,169
in the past there weren't very many zero
days of the target maxim

829
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,319
because

830
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:30,809
uh... their ubiquity wasn't there wasn't
very still from asp our market

831
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,429
uh... but now it's your days are good
we're gonna start to see

832
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,829
uh...

833
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:37,059
attacks that

834
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:40,839
can go after backs and they can take the
time he observes the else's uses

835
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:43,099
energies will part unplugged play

836
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:48,269
uh... into these into such attacks

837
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:49,349
and

838
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,309
uh... whether this event is for ever

839
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:54,949
for vendors money than just a national
or market

840
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,909
is that these interchangeable parts also
make it much easier for the mask our

841
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,549
guys for downstream

842
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:02,829
into surf copy and paste whatever the
saturday manufacturers are doing

843
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:06,539
will be much easier for them to compile
incisive for their devour capture

844
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:08,159
eleanor you're black

845
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,799
your blackwater

846
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,410
uh... and we actually saw that with the
readers here it it because it was the

847
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,949
first readers your day

848
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,379
uh... in two years and that's how our
market

849
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:21,139
log on to a and spread fairly quickly
because now be finally had a p affects

850
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,469
what to get used again

851
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,970
everything else that they were using
word

852
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,519
was like a card to describe from twenty
ten twenty one in now they had actually

853
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,069
something new that they could go out no

854
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:33,329
an exploits of the first generation of
this concert called we need you

855
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,929
and interest by did you which was like
another phase of the attack exciter

856
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:40,479
sofa mask our guys is that all these
things become more concise

857
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,789
uh... it should become so easier for
them

858
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:46,369
now the point about uh... copycat
attacks is the uh... about gwendolyn

859
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:49,089
bout timid about george crops uh...

860
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,379
use the february readers here david
assets template so it was a different

861
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:56,809
booklet and some other techniques work
copyright off whatever here

862
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:57,539
yai

863
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,970
basically dizzy to the python scripts
and to substitute out

864
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,449
javascript from the readers here then

865
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:08,109
uh... copy stuffing zeroing out the f
file formats history unscripted

866
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:09,899
move apart around

867
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:12,179
because i think i'm a funny way too

868
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,890
to make it work but you got to work

869
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,389
uh... another thing that issue evolves
compositions yancey

870
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:20,560
more multi bender multi products

871
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,539
attacks

872
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:22,959
as

873
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:29,459
apple and then in microsoft adobe as we
all make things harder to

874
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,379
to attack as we become harder to attack

875
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,499
really raising the bar his

876
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,119
apple has an boxing

877
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,969
applications have much now mix up when
the state has him boxing rear floss wear

878
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,119
hats and boxing

879
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,329
i say they need more bugs to be able to
to achieve your tax

880
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:46,249
and

881
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:49,509
if you just look at many of the reasons
uh...

882
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:52,389
attack seventeen some midtech
resistivity

883
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:55,819
use and it's a small side and a multi
product

884
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:57,249
areas uh...

885
00:40:57,249 --> 00:41:00,079
uh... pun dents way thirteen

886
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,489
uh... the crumbs embarks bypassed by
going up through through the windows

887
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,309
kernel

888
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:07,720
defy square exploit also had eight ten

889
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,499
aspect to it when they went out through
uh...

890
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:14,279
phosphoric acid craske demanding aptech
mcsweeney denied

891
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:18,479
to team the attack

892
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:22,119
fleiss players here day for the sent
firefox inbox escaped actually involve

893
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:24,089
two different doubly products

894
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:27,409
foster cause crash that happened the
initial a control it in the sand box in

895
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:29,609
the hamlet another adobe product

896
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:31,999
to skate december x

897
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,159
and

898
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,109
uh... pure burgerville

899
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:36,329
you uh...

900
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,209
who gave a talk on

901
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,559
p_f_ sam oxes and can set plans

902
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,589
what it's actually he demo was aid

903
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:45,309
multi product attack

904
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:48,019
unified telegraph reader is able to get

905
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,139
i control that way but then

906
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:54,249
we got out there as he had no user tear
day which used to to break up

907
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:55,319
reader sandbox

908
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,949
by going out to write

909
00:41:56,949 --> 00:42:00,179
so

910
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,039
the your answer to seize more more
complicated tax where

911
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,649
it's not going to be one product to
sacbee

912
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,349
i'd just one under

913
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,969
estimate things harder in terms of
tragedies these attacks

914
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,500
uh... there's a couple

915
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,249
more examples

916
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:18,869
podium from twenty as well

917
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:23,369
he defied update from sandbox using six
different gods

918
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:26,399
who has not got out using fourteen
different ones

919
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:28,159
tutsis get sam

920
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,999
rights as a vendor that's a lot testing
you have to go in individually

921
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:33,059
identified each one of those bonds

922
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:34,979
you have to be able to then creek

923
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:38,449
units that's that's hard to get on the
spot to greet you tests isn't always

924
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:42,469
easy because some of those u_p_i_ spin
weary twenty uh...

925
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:46,519
uh... binary local control insights and
box that you have to write

926
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:50,719
uh... custom code to be able to hit all
those layers and contests those

927
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,569
says those buds

928
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,819
uh... it means we have to take greater
attention to

929
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:58,699
this shelter that we take a look at for
instance

930
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:02,889
whether things i was thinking about from
the toned down exploit

931
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:04,999
uh... from built-in is

932
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,520
assert ask myself with that caught the
i_d_

933
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,579
aspect of that here

934
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:13,079
right similar says me because they would
see the flash player crash

935
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:15,999
i would like if i thought for a crash
would identify

936
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,529
depository keep spray

937
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:22,099
you know that i have to sit there and
actually go through the assembly of the

938
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,700
of the exploits actually see the i_d_'s
european diem now that i have to go now

939
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,259
fine microsoft is ninety two point

940
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:32,889
uh... is i'd like to put to test and
explore uh... yet so

941
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:36,429
it means that we have to continue take
deeper and deeper looks at at absolutely

942
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:38,699
understand every aspect of exploit

943
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,859
because they're going to use more sample
books

944
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,599
the first lady's always easy to seize
the

945
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,069
but the way our bugs like information
leaking the readers your day

946
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:50,659
those are things that you can always see
if you sit there and roy spent some time

947
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:52,720
to show can understand what's going on

948
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,730
eight each phase of the attack

949
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,610
and

950
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,370
pointed out is that uh... with mentors
who uh... work with bugs that involve

951
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,639
multiple products

952
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,509
we might get false-positive reports so
someone submits a book tickets for it's

953
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:09,229
in flash player but in fact it's and and
other partners product and uh... we have

954
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,799
to do the due diligence in technopark
but uh... indian it's really something

955
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:16,679
involving another vendor and we have to
hand over responsibly writen we've had a

956
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,729
case that justin paschal they mais pas
prayerfully each day because in a flash

957
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,920
player yew trees and plants player

958
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,549
but it was actually a browser begun sasa
lover to two brothers

959
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:31,109
uh... because we were just part b_
straight

960
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:34,129
so uh...

961
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,019
immediate sorry i have to have always
partnerships people talk to all these

962
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:38,799
different teams and also

963
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,739
it made the point earlier about

964
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:43,619
being able to you

965
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,329
started things and

966
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:51,069
for spicy don't have too much popular it
will have the penetration

967
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,639
so

968
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,069
dugan's body psychic if it's microsoft
at their relationship with microsoft and

969
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:59,679
a dozen of the people in called but
microsoft lake

970
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,569
if its actors get better and better at
targeting specific individuals and

971
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:05,359
knowing the initials uh... specific

972
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,319
machine information before they is in
the exploit

973
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,149
you know that that the other software
may be very

974
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:14,969
uh... it may be a vendor that we've
never heard of before that we have to do

975
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:15,240
it

976
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,369
reach out to them

977
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:18,829
as part of this year they response
process men

978
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,449
that stuff since the early response
process

979
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:24,660
uh... so we have to be able to ran for
that we have to be uh...

980
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,849
diligent what we do

981
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:31,979
the complexity may lead to some bit
efforts for the book uh...

982
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,969
fermented people on the defensive
reasons that

983
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,689
uh... will remain to be seen whether
these actually uh...

984
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:38,919
helper dot

985
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:42,469
uh... for instance when you have these
bugs switcher you know these attacks in

986
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:44,439
for fourteen months long

987
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:46,899
yes sir i have to address all fourteen

988
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:49,939
uh... in your immediate response where
you might get packed up their they'll

989
00:45:49,939 --> 00:45:52,719
kill woods the budget's out there now

990
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,910
uh... t_v_ have a little bit of time
progress in the rest of them and so i

991
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,279
googled it this way

992
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:59,499
the podium research where

993
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:00,569
they

994
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,709
devoted to turn around twenty four hours
at a twenty four-hour markham volume

995
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:10,719
digest the couple bucks and then some
the other more selected rest of the time

996
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:13,809
vendors we have a the capability of
picking which bugs that they're going to

997
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:18,899
use to uh... strategically copy exploit
too little

998
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:22,709
whether this is a help t_v_a_ ideas
vendors will be remain to be seen

999
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:25,880
as everything gets component eyes it's
gonna multiplied number signatures that

1000
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,289
you have to have to see a passengers
from different parts

1001
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,450
uh... but on the plus side you might be
able to be smart about winfrey

1002
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,029
signatures on might be able to create

1003
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:38,069
seizures on essentially the frame

1004
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:40,520
that everything is bolted onto you as
opposed to you

1005
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,619
the things they are big bulls onesie

1006
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:46,679
so there might be something and help cv
ideas lenders surveys he seems possible

1007
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,219
benefit

1008
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,009
and then the one hopes that i have is as
they create more complex software they

1009
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:54,789
will circulate having the same bouts of
medium we create complex software

1010
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:56,899
sp service mall hope of mine

1011
00:46:56,899 --> 00:46:59,849
we'll see how it goes that we could
always hope that the bad guys

1012
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,569
pushed the button a little too quickly
and there's no actual

1013
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,429
expedition to only we get the bug me fix
before there's an actual

1014
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:09,609
wild

1015
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:12,939
sort we look to the future foreign what
hope is there for for defenders in

1016
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:13,849
academics

1017
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:15,620
there's actually tradition of research

1018
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,239
into normalization of malicious six
pupils

1019
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:19,579
to make my our

1020
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:22,459
more easily detectable by antivirus
programs

1021
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:25,559
so i'm gonna talk about three different
research groups and some of software

1022
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:26,420
done and uh...

1023
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,389
i think there's uh... something we can
learn from from these people

1024
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,849
to chris address with paul's normalize
or uh... handles three kinds of put

1025
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,899
office kitchens

1026
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:35,729
korbi ordering packing

1027
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:38,559
and job search

1028
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,749
this other group accordion mohammed
introduced azeri transformation of uh...

1029
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:45,399
marcos into normal form

1030
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:49,469
in other appreciate all perform actor
outbreaks of cation and echoed

1031
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:50,459
elimination

1032
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:54,649
now you can look at the center of the
house as a part

1033
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:57,249
uh... it's that uh... the research in
the direction of these people of the

1034
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,539
debts can be applied to

1035
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:03,949
lessons in the office getting javascript
and normalizing javascript and compile

1036
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:07,739
actionscript and uh... these are open
research topics for defenders in

1037
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:10,689
academics

1038
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:14,159
so conclusion

1039
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,379
which summarize and you several case
studies to point to a trend

1040
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:22,589
that mass power features sparking
combined with mobile zero exports

1041
00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:26,369
and we're trying to label that trend
mass customize the tax

1042
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,939
now this is a page out of the business
textbook

1043
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:33,559
and the reason fed surety attacks have
become a mass customize it acts or maple

1044
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,619
but they're compare to the reasons for
the evolution of mass customization in

1045
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,649
other industries as listed in the sample

1046
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:43,809
from joe's a fine spoke mass
customization

1047
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:48,369
now defenders and other software
companies could look at this and uh...

1048
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:52,139
and go you know patil explain the
challenges in my to do the job with

1049
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,269
n_b_a_ types

1050
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:56,779
and then do some of the terminology here
so let's let's walk through a few these

1051
00:48:56,779 --> 00:49:00,559
and how that are going to be made to
people of the management chain to look

1052
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,749
at cycle time production quick response
and shortening product life cycles

1053
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:08,709
palace talked at length on this topic
but what comes out to is that uh...

1054
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:12,359
adobe's uh... patching and quick
response is putting pressure is on the

1055
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:16,219
export orders to do things a little
different

1056
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:20,039
conjoined purple post october zero date
in flash player

1057
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:23,859
which was originally targeting max but
later was repurposed windows that's an

1058
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:25,650
example of continual improvement

1059
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:28,039
might have been a customer who was only
running

1060
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:32,049
windows and not mac and so the people
wrote the exploit repurposed that for

1061
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:35,199
windows

1062
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,089
regional marketing globalization

1063
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,929
for several the exports we discussed
there's customize sapo inoperative

1064
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:43,609
timbers and supported including language
pack

1065
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:47,009
differences should and that's an example
of globalization and uh... regional

1066
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:49,649
marketing

1067
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:51,589
just-in-time production

1068
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,719
we noticed that an export kits you can
swap modules and uh... some of the same

1069
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:00,369
things are being seen with uh... exports
these days when local exploits being

1070
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,919
bottled to to one attack

1071
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:06,449
so conclusion was saying that the
features of mass power when combined

1072
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:07,489
with

1073
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,449
zero date targets are the attacks

1074
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:12,529
and the bombing a multiples are the
attacks into a single attack

1075
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:17,409
are the next coming trend of mass
customization exports and uh...

1076
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:19,449
what we do is defenders

1077
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,209
house is going to uh...

1078
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:28,209
talk a little about that

1079
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:31,909
some resemble residences a similar
concepts is you know

1080
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:32,780
political mayor

1081
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,019
effective systems and packing

1082
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:36,329
authorization

1083
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:39,189
and so we have to use all the mails
uh...

1084
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:43,059
mass customization our sites be able to
to match the the invasion that they're

1085
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:44,759
doing on their side

1086
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:46,369
and

1087
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:49,079
uh... there's a missing challenges ever
going to have to deal with concerns

1088
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,029
uh... being that cool

1089
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:54,509
for instance when you're dealing with
these multi-party tax response sent him

1090
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:58,099
some muscle slowed because you have to
be able to go and test the lows

1091
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:03,069
uh... bikes find them all research the
mall is second his quick as

1092
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:05,909
uh... you go find the crash it's his
turn copies

1093
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:08,109
changing from a string copy to uh...

1094
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:11,939
string and copy or some other function
and and ship it out the door guy ruby

1095
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,879
spend more time

1096
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:18,359
taking a look and see him part easier
days before we which around a response

1097
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:21,489
as we need to be able to make sure their
responses can be proportional to the

1098
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:24,159
complexity ever see

1099
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,909
we have to look through all the shell
code make sure that we reversal chilka

1100
00:51:28,909 --> 00:51:31,799
breezed through so thick you know if we
have a place where is your day nelson's

1101
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:34,969
now use their day that we are able now
fine microsoft in time

1102
00:51:34,969 --> 00:51:38,929
uh... so that they can get pet store
owners their portion of the response

1103
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,159
there we have to prepare for the sets in
situations like the yet have a game plan

1104
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:43,569
places that

1105
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:44,589
you know to

1106
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:48,069
how to be able to contact the sender
other vendors

1107
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:51,489
have those relationships built up
they'll be easy if it's you know on the

1108
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,059
top companies because we have
relationships with apple microsoft

1109
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:58,109
and and in google

1110
00:51:58,109 --> 00:52:00,090
but it may be harder thing

1111
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,690
if this has become very target if they
start to

1112
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,779
head uh...

1113
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:05,449
very specific

1114
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:08,469
software because then we have to be able
to go out plans to use by merit the

1115
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:09,699
response teams

1116
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:10,889
exciter sir

1117
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:14,069
it'll be interesting to see an instance
changes going forward

1118
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:17,619
uh... in terms of cycle time reduction
answer in prague

1119
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:18,459
products

1120
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:22,069
we have to be able to

1121
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:25,069
the ourselves at all times people have a
quick response right

1122
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:29,119
if he scaled up and i think we have but
now for user the that has the bugs

1123
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,299
we have another team members in place to
be able to go through

1124
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,130
finalist bikes test those dogs

1125
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,750
in roughly the same of time that we do
for patricia lozier dare erlich two

1126
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,369
dozen the survey worry

1127
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:40,589
answer

1128
00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:43,720
so that we scaled to deal with that
uh... ends

1129
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,620
part of what we're doing is increased
rate of updates so frances with flash

1130
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,780
player or repression once a month now
some practically patch it up

1131
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,069
fairly quickly

1132
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:54,129
uh... but that also gives us the ability
to you

1133
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,449
have trains which are going out the door

1134
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:00,509
every month so we do gives your day
there's a train

1135
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:04,140
uh... it's likely to be coming
significant asset pattinson ended up

1136
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,819
where the customers will protect them

1137
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:09,449
dad's

1138
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:12,559
this is really gonna push vendors
towards defense in depth

1139
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,929
uh... for things i remember bugs for
instance

1140
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:17,460
uh... keeps praise

1141
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,559
its present technically a bug and of
themselves uh... should serve the

1142
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,719
byproduct uh...

1143
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:27,699
working with virtual machines there is a
paper recently and how do you heaps

1144
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:29,509
raising the issue now five

1145
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:32,719
this we can do these films a virtual
machine and it is

1146
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,329
uh... defense definitely in place

1147
00:53:35,329 --> 00:53:38,639
the as we move towards these multi by
attacks

1148
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,619
it he i said we fight used to be safe
because they were very you know

1149
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,119
behind data validation which happens
upfront

1150
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,319
those will become more exposed to very
surprising news

1151
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:51,869
does he get the others internally the
eyes

1152
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:54,239
which they may not gone after before

1153
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,910
so we have to you have to take a look at
serb mentality is like how do we heard

1154
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,359
their virtual machines against things
such as heat stress

1155
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,420
and we also have to spend time

1156
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,029
looking at those defense dept

1157
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:05,759
uh... features because

1158
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:09,289
is his they get those initial crashing
to control inside sam box will be going

1159
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:11,879
after all those internally guys

1160
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:14,289
or things that we

1161
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:16,670
typically wimpy started the bull

1162
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,859
nutritional attacked a now that they're
doing multi buckner mining stuff

1163
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:22,759
preamps billed at more time

1164
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,259
doing that and yes i have to have a bust

1165
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:28,469
patching testing in place that we can
test all those things that we can test

1166
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,959
bugs

1167
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:34,130
for if you guys are buried inside the
application that are directly exposed

1168
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,119
uh... so

1169
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,959
here and be able to cause havoc c_p_i_
strictly be able to call some the

1170
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:42,599
internally abstractly

1171
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:46,539
they are getting better and better what
they do for instance a imposes twitter i

1172
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:51,479
capture from airport knowing who works
for access and sell

1173
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:52,719
and

1174
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,259
uh... he's a guy who's a

1175
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:58,979
he's up against a backdrop and there it
is on something like that is actually

1176
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:02,169
uh... pretty guy response which goes a
step to us that rework this company it's

1177
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:03,279
got a good company

1178
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:07,540
uh... but whether things that he does is
he helps what nice exploits

1179
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,299
let's provide us with this company

1180
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:10,509
and

1181
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:15,359
yet you can see that he's his capability
of not only by passing indebtedness lar

1182
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,459
they also has techniques for going after
email protected cheesy team installed

1183
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:24,519
uh... he's working on techniques people
bypassing

1184
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:25,969
uh... the yet

1185
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:28,119
it's a continual race to be able to keep
up with water

1186
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:30,399
their capabilities and and the

1187
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:33,209
continually adding new slayers defense
dept

1188
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:34,920
to to be able to protect

1189
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,219
uh... in these environments and that's
why season the operating system vendors

1190
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:41,520
like apple and microsoft to exam but
sing into

1191
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,049
the desktop application status because

1192
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,599
it's oquawka rations we'd all must be
able to

1193
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,569
habits middle-age defense

1194
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:51,739
uh... to be able to deal with this serve
increasing rate

1195
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:55,880
uh... that comes from ask association
the quick response quick turnaround

1196
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,359
so

1197
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,999
uh... without will go and take a a
questions does happen yet

1198
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,939
you'll be able to reach out to us and
this is our contact information into

1199
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:05,989
this emails with questions from the top

1200
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:08,949
uh... you may also see a split around
every if we have a bit over in the

1201
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,059
vendor area

1202
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:13,929
overall sbi it was a questions

1203
00:56:13,929 --> 00:56:18,139
any questions now that people have

1204
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:22,199
christians from phuket

1205
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:25,879
honestly which happens between to you
fixing the books before the next which

1206
00:56:25,879 --> 00:56:30,229
was supposed to party was exploited

1207
00:56:30,229 --> 00:56:37,229
silly we do have a students offered
online cycle river consulate in for

1208
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:41,479
bowler billy's are testing through i
internal buzzing efforts proactive stuff

1209
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:44,709
using second also stills all those
things that you would expect

1210
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:48,199
uh... we also work with our partners
princess plus players distributed

1211
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:49,159
through

1212
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:52,439
uh... groups like google so if you look
at the monthly updates

1213
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:53,449
uh... we are

1214
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:56,739
now where are we looking our software to
definable the buildings but we also

1215
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:57,730
google

1216
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,960
tell you what they were part of all the
buildings to us

1217
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,079
uh... they are partners that we work
with uh... rims

1218
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,099
report donor release us in the past
uh...

1219
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,640
wave engines f us player has right now
is that

1220
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,939
because we work summit partners is not
just

1221
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:11,909
our security uh...

1222
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:14,989
response in this weekend ramona billy's
but also others

1223
00:57:14,989 --> 00:57:16,389
uh... and it's

1224
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:20,679
if u assaults on the quotes from dubin
from palm down

1225
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:25,119
uh... we d lisa will just because they
were making things harder because

1226
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,859
the quotes and yankees cres saying you
know

1227
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:30,679
frustrating was her first explain to her

1228
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,249
i think we're

1229
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,749
uh... it's specific to your process

1230
00:57:34,749 --> 00:57:38,339
uh... were growers working to finance
local middle east

1231
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:41,039
the word

1232
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,479
the work that we've been doing is
actually been

1233
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:46,900
uh... paying off and the other thing
that we're doing edition two shes going

1234
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,080
after crashes crashes

1235
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,679
history after crashes this server erase
it's very hard restore when

1236
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,079
so did the where the of the defense in
depth the issues that we put in place of

1237
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:00,769
helps so frances with reader they said
the readers here today we have a spurs

1238
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,939
twenty years since we deployed sandbox

1239
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,319
answerable to you'll get

1240
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:09,829
uh... spread exploits out and the flash
player with a number of things such as

1241
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:14,129
uh... as i mentioned we have put the
plane office now so

1242
00:58:14,129 --> 00:58:17,099
even if you have a crash at your
entrance and after 'em emotions for

1243
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,199
document

1244
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:21,219
we've added where defense there that the
user has now click through the section

1245
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:23,699
dialogue which says

1246
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:26,869
and the dialogues phrase such that
basically says placard typically doesn't

1247
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,289
run word

1248
00:58:28,289 --> 00:58:32,349
uh... you probably don't want to run
this by default says click now

1249
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:35,049
so that even that you have a crash

1250
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:36,359
likely we've

1251
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:38,419
mate taking steps to make that

1252
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:43,479
uh... the delivery of those exploits
much harder

1253
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:45,239
and so on that clear

1254
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:50,989
we have time for one last question okay

1255
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:52,319
right now

1256
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,369
i like the way to build a stuffed up
within boxing in the response

1257
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,240
especially with the protected you in

1258
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,769
between eleven

1259
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:05,649
uh... one thing that annoys me is that
users want to do two things that pbx

1260
00:59:05,649 --> 00:59:07,959
they want to return they want to print
them

1261
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:11,979
aka uh... printing gift is able to
protect accuses never gonna be possible

1262
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:14,529
for them from within the project review

1263
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:18,379
okay susie referring to the fact that
the prompts there's a prompt therefore

1264
00:59:18,379 --> 00:59:21,979
reminder prints

1265
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:26,199
right so that the prompting on printing
their is

1266
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:27,949
device drivers and give

1267
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:29,909
uh... favor wave attacking

1268
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:32,839
marvin's center to be able to print
you've got to be able to go through that

1269
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:34,049
so we've

1270
00:59:34,049 --> 00:59:36,769
uh... we have the quick there just to
make sure that we open up a malicious

1271
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:40,249
p_f_ young kodak printer driver

1272
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:44,099
so it's anything under sense is that
this knowing roy server finding what we

1273
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:44,749
do it

1274
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:45,590
redo around that

1275
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,219
but there's a reasonably we had a quick
there

1276
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,010
breitbart

1277
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,149
so

1278
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:53,359
breeding is always going to be on c_

1279
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,189
but such as saying

1280
00:59:55,189 --> 00:59:57,419
uh...

1281
00:59:57,419 --> 01:00:00,369
recreating is ok throwing the right if
you

1282
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:04,819
but if you want a print your use of
optimal

1283
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:08,189
yet in some cases unit

1284
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:11,869
so we decide that step there so you have
a chance to look at the ethnic shirts at

1285
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:13,939
the p_f_ you recognize

1286
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:19,679
before you you go to that next step
babies deal happens p athens

1287
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,959
garbage which a lot of exploits are than
macadamia league print amrita repeat

1288
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:27,099
ease two-d_ the if you will be

1289
01:00:27,099 --> 01:00:31,289
and

1290
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:32,429
server

1291
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:36,169
russo working on that when you meet
uh... reacted to really and they were

1292
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:39,629
retailer working on the reader sandbox
with reader eleven we added

1293
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:43,379
uh... new protections where rewrite on
separate uh... desktop

1294
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:47,450
and sever workstation

1295
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,549
and we're going to see refining going
forward

1296
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:51,480
i don't know

1297
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:56,099
will be able to dress apple computer
fighting for

1298
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:59,549
thank you very much kelly's tactic used
i mean thanking them for their session

1299
01:00:59,549 --> 01:00:59,799
today
