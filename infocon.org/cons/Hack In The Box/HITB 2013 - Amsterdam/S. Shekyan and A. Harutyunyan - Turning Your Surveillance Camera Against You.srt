1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,709
well

2
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:15,709
well

3
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:22,749
yes

4
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,040
hi everybody us so

5
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,150
are some works on the log management

6
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,890
Qualis antiwar.com for a publication
vulnerability scanner engine

7
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,610
and we don't have any hardware hacking
experience so

8
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,730
we gonna fuck our talk is gonna for be
is going to be focused on

9
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,910
remote access a to the cameras

10
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,310
so closer to Christmas time I started
receiving

11
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,070
emails like from view deal alerts

12
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,910
third hiking gets wireless IP camera for
under $70

13
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,940
box so I thought yeah why not

14
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,250
others do some research in just
searching the Google for

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,380
indoor wireless IP camera like first
three results are

16
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,890
up about four scam cameras so I just got
one

17
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,619
and while I was waiting for the camera
to be to revert I

18
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,990
look that's Amazon's product page of the
camera

19
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,860
ants there already interesting thinks
least it's like

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,180
you can stream data its can

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,430
email and FTP to you which means it
probably stores the credentials and

22
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,540
be interesting to see how the

23
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,799
manage that plus baby a

24
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,510
their effort to port forwarding guess

25
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,600
the simple something

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,489
simple to do so were really

27
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,370
looking forward to get the camera and
start playing with it

28
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,280
ants so

29
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,860
what the camera is what we're going to
talk about this particular modell

30
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,880
Force Camp if I 89 10 W

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,400
which is mg take camera which means they
just stream

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,989
up J pic files one after another

33
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,970
through or http part there are a lot of

34
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,080
other vendors that probably use the same
for where

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,330
ants we are sure they're using the same

36
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,049
a Saltire that Force Camp develops or

37
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:13,570
maybe some other company develops it for
false false can we don't really know

38
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:13,970
that

39
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,359
those details but we know that a lot of
MJ take cameras

40
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,430
at available are using the same

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,889
software com components

42
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,959
so you're a chance you see the nukes
which is like him but it's

43
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,480
embed its remix Karen O very high
streets

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,190
almost nothing only

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,709
except the colonel itself and and is

46
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,850
a board support packages also available
from

47
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,579
the for fender so we were able to

48
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,630
cross compile and build our own

49
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,959
X executives executables

50
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,989
and the

51
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,989
we're going to use the terms

52
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,220
that fall scam uses they call every

53
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,609
component on the system up a farm where
but it's not really a four-way race of

54
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,919
just the binary file but we're going to
use that firmware work

55
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:20,109
just to stick to their conventions

56
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,230
so apps sorry so you're basically
consists of

57
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,550
a there are three main component system
a

58
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,680
which includes the d

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,240
the caramel itself and d the executable

60
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,570
which is one single executable and all
the CGI calls and embedded Web server

61
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,460
and probably try verse for the camera
itself

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,020
are packed in one binary file web UI
which is

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,150
up file that contains the

64
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,870
the static HTML HTML Javascript and CSS
and some image files

65
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,900
that are gonna be served through

66
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,110
over HTTP and settings file which stores
the

67
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,270
camera settings and on your credentials
and all

68
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,120
configuration thats whats

69
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,270
customize your camera just briefly

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,680
go over what the files look like sold
its system for where

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,930
is a custom binary file it starts with a
header

72
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,840
like 20 bytes or something there are two
different versions with their

73
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,840
almost the same ants a four bytes of
magic number

74
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,340
and and sizes of two files been it's
been and throw my first image

75
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,340
and files themselves and you can see the
things being sick

76
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,340
version of

77
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,340
Farlin trauma fests though

78
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,220
the details are you can mount the stroma
fessing your

79
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,190
on your Linux using irregular moms

80
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,200
you can find details I'll by this link

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,170
how to deal with from offense it's read
only filesystem

82
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,950
there's nothing fancy I read you I just
looks like

83
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,630
these wish we don't work for Amazon is
just Artemus apartments

84
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,800
with Amazon books just received some
think your camera maybe

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,860
and web UI simple HTML

86
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,750
ants some help for JavaScript

87
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,880
which basically is for making CGI calls
to

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,150
take camera and to get some
functionality out of it

89
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,260
it maybe I just drop around CJ

90
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,570
API

91
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,110
and of

92
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,870
now all communication is in plain text a

93
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,320
to use basic server authentication and
you can made it

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,410
make a call to CGI either by providing
this

95
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,380
out Thor authority part of the your own

96
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,400
like pride Inc username and password to
further with

97
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,750
column or you can't provide the
credentials as a querystring

98
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,110
ok didn't feed on the sly sorry there
this after video stream that CGI

99
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,000
question mark there's username equals
user and pout PWD

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,080
people's passwords day are both equal

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,640
ants that way guys also custom

102
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,250
file a with a header and there's

103
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,820
some kind of protection implemented
physical check some

104
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,510
a and three experiment so we figured out
the

105
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,390
this check some is some of all bytes
starting offset see

106
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,430
a something next so

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,500
gathered it's either and then author
Heather

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,240
section starts the actual file name
sweets farming sizes from file size:

109
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,660
them

110
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,889
file itself it sort of a power

111
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,590
which and setting sections of text size
5 kilobytes

112
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,510
a file that

113
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,110
directly mopped into the memory all the
camera

114
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,970
and the also very simple like Heather
with checks on with the same

115
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,240
algorithm for check summit some awful
but starting but see

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,600
as starting will succeed it contains
sold

117
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,820
sensitive information bike

118
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,000
all your credentials for the camera

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,780
your network settings your wifi settings
and credentials

120
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,070
email credentials if you setup your
camera send all

121
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,000
few snapshots of

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,849
what's happening or if there's some
movement detected

123
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:45,209
a and surprisingly for example on their

124
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:50,010
tutorial video which most a house fires
for example are gonna follow

125
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,170
the use Gmail as an example and

126
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,500
a lot of people provide gmail
credentials in the camera to

127
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,880
sent that information for their Gmail
accounts

128
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,120
and settings files the same

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,790
like third wharf is the checks on

130
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,860
so there's some

131
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,790
we're gonna start yeah and after
providing

132
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,769
this brief overview now you would ask

133
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,130
how we getting to that camera they have

134
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,560
user names they have to use basics are
authentic Asian if you cannot see the

135
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,500
traffic

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,810
are you gonna access so

137
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,930
that up to ager sort the former

138
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,290
duties or an article probably yards from
their beauty

139
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,949
so this authentication bypass I was

140
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,990
reported in meet March by

141
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,379
to French guys are ninth for three and

142
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,449
I there's some his three

143
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:59,220
behind his former beauty so initial X 34
here is is back

144
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,420
you puts able to access the

145
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,660
air alias of the memory by just
requesting this first being clicked

146
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,029
camera URL and double slash pro cake or
you

147
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,589
gets a sixteen megabytes yeah 16
megabyte file Dom

148
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,149
which ek is actually the camera memory
which contains all the

149
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,850
everything and then they patched eats by
not allowing

150
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,449
a any often wary character softer a

151
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,230
if they're up to 140 slashes so bypass
would be

152
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,699
just level up and a then they fix that
to

153
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,889
and a current affairs and the late
response doesn't have that little beauty

154
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:39,540
but

155
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,649
some flavor solve them this that third
one the Spanish while we discovered

156
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,749
I don't know maybe it's the same thing
is just after of

157
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,809
which Fig particular from where you are
think we've

158
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:54,329
because there could be the same it ends
with forty eight but some forty eighths

159
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,800
are vulnerable to these and some

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,100
are are not but you can do the Spanish
or some

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,540
directory that exists on on the camera
and you

162
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,059
to to level up and im pro cake or in to
get the same dump

163
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:09,129
and also these those guys

164
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:14,540
found his privilege escalation you are
aware you could have

165
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,499
and username I

166
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,509
user of the camera with operator proud
role

167
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,089
three roles could be guest operator and
administrator

168
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,240
and if you have somehow got access to
the camera

169
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,279
as operator you can dump the

170
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,699
memory in I thinking even the latest
firmware

171
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:38,930
through this URL ants

172
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:44,519
cake or file first of all your as I said
it mops that's i think's file

173
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,389
twice first at offset 3 megabytes and
another one of the five megabytes

174
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,829
and read your old up camera for example

175
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,089
credentials writing the file you can do
strings on that file

176
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,290
you'll find everything for you can use
our to that we are gonna are some

177
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,509
commercial later

178
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,559
that would automatically extract
everything from

179
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,850
a it also contains some information on

180
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,550
I'll local on the Internet intranet

181
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,029
for example I found by iPhones IP and
name

182
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,110
in that file plus I found by Peter
information

183
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,850
in that file probably at the camera has
UPnP functionality to take probably send

184
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,290
some kinda fun

185
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,949
broadcast message you sent the store
replies

186
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:34,970
%uh you so you're so

187
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,689
this spot so far so is applicable to any

188
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:42,769
camera if you are targeting someone you
know he has the camera and you know

189
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,860
he might open some email from you

190
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,889
I'll the CSRF for beauty could be useful

191
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:52,019
we've far this eve for E

192
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,379
a couple days ago a I don't know

193
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,290
I'm sure a lot of people knew about this
but nobody

194
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,670
documented it so with the so basically
for example you can

195
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,589
CSR you can't do a CSRF attacks on any
fee see GI ko love the camera

196
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:13,649
because prozor with cash a the basics
are authentication for you

197
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,240
and wherever with open

198
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,309
peace URL tweets a already at being a
syndicated

199
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:25,499
you just don't know make a request to
the camera with these parameters and

200
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:29,670
this one for example would at the user
CSRF a password CSRF without me

201
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,369
privileges

202
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:35,199
and every every CGI call could be

203
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,850
axis like this

204
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,420
and so just to summarize so if you want
to get the camera or

205
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,509
besides buying one you can get the
camera by either

206
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:52,129
in the wild by a of fight going to
saddam

207
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,009
thats great search engine I at
sourceforge.net waif

208
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:59,459
IP camera a.m. and it works

209
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,499
are told go deeper into these

210
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:05,949
and the got just

211
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:09,540
fast majority of cameras which to have
these parts are some little beauty

212
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,819
or you can always looking brute force
because F no

213
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:17,339
up protection whatsoever no throttle
down link that connects to rate or

214
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,819
and nothing like that so ants

215
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,899
password and user fields are 12 fight

216
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,290
long so would be pretty easy to
brute-force

217
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,420
or if it's a targeted attack you do the
CSRF or click checking because they

218
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,249
don't do any

219
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:37,110
anti framing protection no

220
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,699
done nothing those not through
JavaScript through

221
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:48,499
was the header extreme options

222
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:51,989
so you up from now on we are swimming

223
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,369
you somehow got access to the camera so

224
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,879
what's next national tell you

225
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,910
so once once you go

226
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,350
access to the camera so here some things
that you can do so

227
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,739
apart from the obvious things like you
know robbing them be just three more

228
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:09,809
acquiring

229
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:15,160
all the credentials which are stored in
a camera like you know email FTP

230
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,949
can store your ADSL passport to wifi
password

231
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:22,629
and it's basically as you have seen it
it is like a

232
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:26,470
pretty nice scanner of the Internet so
you can you know just

233
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,970
dump the camera memory and see what
other things are out there

234
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,379
so you can in principle think of this
camera is just a a small Linux box with

235
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:35,899
you know

236
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,069
arm our machine with very limited amount
of

237
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,509
memory and CPU but it's a

238
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:47,489
itself fully fledged Linux box so you
can in principle run arbitrary software

239
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,209
on it

240
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,209
and you can think of something like both
in that boat

241
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:56,209
or you know not own a miser proxy or you
know just a scanner for an Internet

242
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,499
or since its VoIP server after all you
can use it to host your

243
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:05,449
mall where and from another point to a
few it's also you can think of it as a

244
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:06,290
book's

245
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,519
on the internet which is accessible from
internet so it can be

246
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,809
like a platform for advancing

247
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,910
Europe talk further into the net for

248
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,279
and it also can be used as again as a
platform to a talk

249
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,329
brother of the victim because you can
always use that

250
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:28,009
web server and you can also use the

251
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,300
since you I will show later how you can
modify the

252
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,029
but interface of the camera you can use
it as a %uh

253
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,709
you know to put some something like a be
fairly browser expletive system crisis

254
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,709
yet

255
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,149
broderick's to host the browser
exploitation framework and get to hook

256
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:46,119
into

257
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:49,309
victims prozor so a.m. outlets

258
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,759
pick some numbers because okay if you
have one camera

259
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,009
to but infarct what is interesting here
that you have

260
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:00,660
hundreds of thousands of these scammers
out there so

261
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,420
just according to show them

262
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,280
there are about 100000

263
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,339
a Asus show the nose above hundred souls
and

264
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,819
so this is our findings but I have heard
some other people speaking

265
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:18,699
much bigger numbers but anyways there is
at least about 200,000

266
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,180
camera so or a all out there and the
number is growing

267
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,199
and the funny thing is that few goal to
for example

268
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,150
a like three hours before

269
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,600
I was the flight offered on my break the
camera that I heard they had

270
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,330
so I had to run to store to buy one so
when I went there you know you find them

271
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,600
in a home security section so they sell
this device is a something you know tool

272
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,880
to secure your home

273
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,460
but you know in fact it's you're just
buying

274
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,430
big bridge but nevertheless those are
very popular so there's a

275
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,570
the numbers are growing and a

276
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,640
yet so just to if your phone to find his
camera some show them you just have to

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,490
enter this net over IP camera insert and
this is the

278
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,490
HTTP Server header that camera

279
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,810
replaced with so this is how sure that
identifies

280
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,640
those cameras the other way to find
camera sees the

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,970
DDNS so says this is a ferry
consumer-oriented products

282
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,680
the camera vendors what they do they
provide

283
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,920
a a DDNS service so what happens is that

284
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,430
a each camera has us like pre-assigned

285
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:40,260
hostname and water passes that whenever
you put the camera to the network first

286
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,030
think it does

287
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:47,380
it goes back home saying that this is me
so that the their DNS servers there's a

288
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,000
record which associates this

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,760
kind of hard coded hostname Witcher
camera came from with with your IP

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,250
address

291
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,720
you can of course shut this off and
there are some

292
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,950
vendors which implement this using not
DNS but by using

293
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,320
VoIP server like a a say

294
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,420
they have enough watches so you know you

295
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,390
your you go to their web server and then
dais send the 30

296
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,850
to with the reply to you with your
actual IP address but the

297
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,690
the principles ID's the same so just out
of curiosity

298
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,840
one lazy afternoon work ID that just so

299
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,360
yeah and the four-month the form art
again for usability purposes

300
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,870
this is this the host name so the host
names follow

301
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,679
certain format depending on the vendor
so for example for

302
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,660
force.com it is 2 letters followed by
four digits so

303
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,710
what I did I just wrote ish shell script
which

304
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,330
just scar on the entire DNS namespace
for for this force come

305
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,400
so it turned out that their have been

306
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,620
mark 100 for two thousand records with
with violet

307
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,520
eyepiece the so a so because in fact
they have

308
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,290
I think because of some security

309
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,770
a or you know consideration they didn't
want to allow

310
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,910
a a there so creating new records and
their DNS so what they did they just

311
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,940
predefined all the records but

312
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,860
records which have no value they just
for 127 001

313
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,590
so when I say valley that mean all the
AP's except for

314
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,179
for the local oh so Ice condom then as
an iphone-like

315
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:39,620
104 2012 at the AP's out of those at the
point when I was doing scar on forty

316
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,810
1000 actually responded to ping and out
of those seventy

317
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,130
a seventh will 7200 head

318
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,670
VoIP server running on port 80 now not
all of these

319
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,400
of course our cameras because in fact
most of the cameras are behind not so

320
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,220
what you see

321
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,620
in the DNS is the IP address of the
rotor

322
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,440
which they used to get to the Internet
but

323
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,870
and a but some of them are connected
directly

324
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,310
and some of them have this sport forever
think so because

325
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:16,440
104 again again one of the biggest
problems with this camera says the

326
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,710
to the way home vendors recommend to set
them up

327
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,750
is broken is very bed so

328
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,240
that's why you have you know people just
to the port forwarding on

329
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,429
port 80 and expose their cameras to

330
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:36,200
the to the internet so a out of those
there were actually two thousand six

331
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,610
hundred cameras

332
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,900
which were actually camera switch I was
looking for and up

333
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,120
I didn't ask on any other port apart
from eighty

334
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,150
I just sconce only one vendor so

335
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:56,290
it would be pretty safe to assume that
if you're really off to rate you can

336
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,130
really find in no time solvents of

337
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,190
of this camera's so

338
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,810
right a now

339
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,820
actually we were suppose to to to give a
demo

340
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,860
and that's why you know like three hours
before going to the airport I was

341
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,960
running to the shop to buy camera

342
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,669
so but the camera it was okay brought
the main so

343
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:25,780
and then you know we came here so first
sync with it we wanted

344
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,960
to not to make sure that everything
works I went to speaker lounge

345
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,040
set everything up forked hooked up the
camera

346
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,950
and I successfully bricked so a a

347
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,360
was like Murphy's Law in action but what
happened is that

348
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,550
actually if you go to speakers on

349
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,750
the they have this place for you picture
the connector

350
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,890
camera to the power and it's very flaky
so what happened is that

351
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,110
while I was updating the firmware
someone touched it and

352
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,440
you know the power on top and the home
so

353
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,690
good luck but we we nevertheless

354
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,800
we quote done a you know we knew that
something will go wrong so we made the

355
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,620
a screencast at the while we were at
home so

356
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,810
I'm going to show you this crank us and
they hope it won't be very disappointed

357
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,200
so a so what actually what we're going

358
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,500
to demonstrate here is several things
the first we're going to

359
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,630
so we're taking a vanilla camera we
actually were

360
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:34,020
not demonstrating call to to assume that
we know the password because

361
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,929
getting really getting the passport this
is true bill

362
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,530
so you just have to dump the memory in
from to read it from

363
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,160
the from the predefined offset so what
with the

364
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,380
after work so we create the back there
so we create another mean

365
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,740
admin user and then modify event
interface

366
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,640
in a way that we poison it basically so
when the legitimate user goes to the vet

367
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
interface

368
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,960
she doesn't see anything so for the next
thing we do

369
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,860
without the aqui injector JavaScript

370
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,650
to the victim's browser and a DA's the
weekend the several 6 their

371
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,370
will show and the last thing is we

372
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,740
modified the the camera firmware so what
we do install a proxy server on the

373
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,679
camera

374
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,380
and it's written in a way that if

375
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,980
so if if the legitimate users trying

376
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,870
to is is you know opening a connection
to it then it forwards

377
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,120
the than it for first traffic tools a

378
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,600
normal to the legitimate the application

379
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,010
otherwise it it is used as a proxy

380
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,980
and Sergei will talk about it and in
more detail

381
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,810
so here are the steps that needs to be

382
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,010
that need to be performed for up

383
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,720
poisonings have that user interface now
a

384
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
it it could have been much simpler

385
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,000
in a sense that you know we could just
replace the valve interface with one

386
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,320
version but the thing is that our idea
was that

387
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,370
it doesn't make much sense just to

388
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,990
put something random when the camera
because the owner will not is very

389
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,880
quickly

390
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,530
and will take it down so what we do here
we

391
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,890
we first tried to figure out what is
there version of the firmware that's

392
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,280
running on the camera

393
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,410
so we'll find the same version were
modified

394
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,980
week so well pocket so we modified

395
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,620
and with pocket back verifies that to
check some much and everything

396
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,690
that would push it to the camera and
a.m.

397
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,560
clean up the looks now this blue parts
that you see here

398
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,190
this is actually so lecture developed a
small tool kit

399
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,880
for for doing this a so you know for
extracting and parking

400
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,030
view I system firmware and also said
thanks

401
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,590
and also we just put us

402
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,700
small script together which lets to

403
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,720
may to perform all the steps

404
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,790
91 goers as a single come on so

405
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm going to

406
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,940
group

407
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,149
so I'm going to show you the screen cuz
no

408
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:26,690
to if

409
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:33,690
will be fun if the screen cuz 2004

410
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,240
okay so so for

411
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,549
the first sync first thing that we do
here is

412
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:08,549
we just I think you just pulled year

413
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,630
yeah so we first show that you know we
have a camera it has a

414
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,340
user admin them to pass or we look into
it with just

415
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,190
show that everything works is just min
sergei sitting there recording the

416
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,910
webcast so

417
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:31,820
a so we navigate to so this is this is
how the February looks you have

418
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,799
frivolous in this on so this is that
this is how the administrative

419
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,080
part of the vid good looks like and this
is the list of use ourselves a camera so

420
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,470
it's just funny look camera just out of
the box fresh so it's only

421
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,799
admin user with her with no password
empty

422
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,929
so what we're going to do we're going to
inject the new user

423
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,640
in position eight and this is the and

424
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,910
this is the script that we're on

425
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,770
to to up to poison the view I

426
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,419
source as you can see this writings and
green so it finds the right

427
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,720
figures out the version of that you I
then

428
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,809
a finds the marching version verifies
that its

429
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:20,120
it's correct then on Park said for sour
patches in place

430
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,010
fucks everything back together and
pushes it back to the camera know when

431
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,380
it pushes back to the camera as you can
see

432
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,260
the camera becomes unresponsive because
it needs some time

433
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,510
to to reboot for

434
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,290
and put the new going to listen to see
that nothing is going on I'm

435
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,870
hitting refresh but there's a a no
response from the camera

436
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:48,870
so think they can

437
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,760
so yeah I'm just forward

438
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,900
yes so at this point

439
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,240
so I'm still I'm still waiting

440
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,230
for the camera to to come back

441
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:14,230
and the secrets to

442
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,679
some tears

443
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,110
right so this is what we're waiting for
so it stopped responding to pings

444
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,570
and the moment it comes back means that
the

445
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,870
the cameras up again and we will go

446
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,169
back to the observer okay

447
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:49,169
so it's back

448
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,150
right so we here we log in with a new
user

449
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,140
that were just created is so the fought
minutes how can the books

450
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,460
2013 Amsterdam and

451
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,500
so you can see that did still works

452
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,240
and actually when it's when it's booting
could just rotates around itself

453
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,060
and a a so we go to use our section

454
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,670
and you see here that it's the same
thing is just you know

455
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,800
disarming user and but the new user

456
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,090
which we just created its not here
anymore it's it's not displayed here

457
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,280
because we we poison the user interface

458
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,840
and so the next think that it's going to
be demonstrated here

459
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,880
is yet this is again just to demonstrate
that you know nothing is broken

460
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,310
everything is working

461
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,910
so the next thing that we're going to
demonstrate is injecting

462
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,390
the JavaScript into the into the venue

463
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,880
so what happens here is that first we're
going

464
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,390
to replace the video stream with the
still image that would take

465
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,980
on the flight so no yes this is me
struggling

466
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,480
with Firefox icon yeah and there's you
see you see the

467
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,450
so the images now it's it's a study came
so a lot of people

468
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,950
use this cameras for example for their
garage so you know if you want to break

469
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,170
into the garage

470
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,480
this is what you do so this is the
JavaScript that when inserted

471
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,280
again there was an alert and yeah now

472
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,400
brought everything back things are still
operational

473
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:34,030
the I think you're so I think this is it
for

474
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,800
sis 1 so the next

475
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,230
them all than

476
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:47,470
Sonnex them or so what we're going to do
we're going to

477
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,710
altered the the firmware of the Cameron

478
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,790
no not not the that user interface so

479
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,380
again here steps are very similar that
we need to find the right version on

480
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,280
Pocket for shower changes said

481
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,590
the difference is that it's a bit more
complicated because

482
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,980
a circuit old the firmware is the Linux
kernel

483
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,990
plus this read-only file system so what
we need to do

484
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:15,320
we need to marxists read-only file
system since it's read only weekend

485
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,280
that's right to it so we have to cope it
over Autoworks changes that generates a

486
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,030
new image out of the director

487
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,200
structure that we have and pocketbook
and another complexities that

488
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,990
sus think that we're going to put the
camera the executable has to be

489
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,480
cross compile so that'd France

490
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,270
on on the camera and to actual seeing

491
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,510
again thinks the sings in blue

492
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,760
are tools which were missing and we

493
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,810
we wrote them and that's the code is
available

494
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:53,810
I'm so yes just thought I'd let sergei
explain what what we're all talking to

495
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,440
the camera

496
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,870
your first for out some echo $server
them I'll

497
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,350
world a proxy just demonstrate because
you can compile anything on it yet

498
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,360
compiles NEC called with problems with
compounding threats but

499
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,700
it's ok because the Linux kernel is his
very own is Althea

500
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,060
but their proxies just acts as a a
reverse proxy is whether connects

501
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,300
doesn't know it's a proxy and it

502
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,900
so just about of

503
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,550
camera us web server would respond to
the responses to

504
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,490
to the request proxy but if somebody
knows that it's a proxy

505
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,520
a to proxy server act as a proxy server

506
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,620
not normal process or like for example
to connect your

507
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,330
in the beginning the request that means
it tries to establish a tunnel to

508
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,250
google.com

509
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,960
port 443 NP just acts as a approx so

510
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,060
yeah and points is that since the owner
of the

511
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,890
cap over the camera port forwarded or
enabled on the port

512
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,000
eighty our script is downloading the
firmware

513
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,470
changing the listening port for the real
that embedded Web server to

514
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,350
for example 81 and our camera reasons to
port 80

515
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,409
so its two walks everything still works
from outside of his

516
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,850
internet ants as well as from inside

517
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,850
as well as from inside so

518
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,440
the next is again another

519
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,440
screen close

520
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,490
so you're a again it starts by

521
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:48,490
demonstrating that to a everything works

522
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,020
send then we launched this script which
does everything

523
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,750
you know just automates all the stuff
that i just described

524
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,150
here's a consumer changing the original
for

525
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,270
of which camera licence were just
bumping it up

526
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,680
and then a for

527
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,680
can just

528
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,010
yet so what we do here with change the
port

529
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,820
will find the right for snow the
firmware verifies a integrity

530
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,890
so we up extracted then we push

531
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,130
or binary to it would regenerate the
file system image

532
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,900
then regenerate a a firmware image

533
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,690
and we for should to the yet we're
uploading it

534
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,130
back to the camera and once it's back

535
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,180
you know so action what happens here is
that

536
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,760
with this issue the post we get they
should

537
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,470
200 okay back but then still would have
to wait for some time

538
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,980
until the firmware is a

539
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,920
extra extracted and you know applied and

540
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,160
the can raise rebooked so

541
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,359
voicing weekend fast-forward here so

542
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:24,349
your here so yet again

543
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:28,640
this you see that to a we're waiting for
the camera to

544
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,710
to report its not responding to so

545
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:37,270
yet now when it

546
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:42,530
when it comes back what we want to see
we still want to see that

547
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,550
to a the says videos

548
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,890
that it is still working candidates is
the video stream is still available

549
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,160
on the same port so here is just to

550
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,099
a proxy for a short time sure yet so
it's a shortcut URL

551
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:00,550
to just to demonstrate the video stream
but the difference is that is now

552
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,290
the traffic is going through our proxy
and use each

553
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,369
it's a normal browser and you know

554
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:11,740
we would tie pins as a URL of the approx
and it still works now

555
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,010
what we do next yeah

556
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,310
so what we do next here we just enable a
proxy

557
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,619
so we we make our browser

558
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,720
to use the camera so you can see the IP
of the camera

559
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,119
and Portis for day to just the same port
that would just use the browser

560
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,810
to connect to now it makes we use this

561
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,170
a we we use cameras a proxy

562
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:46,170
and then what happens he's so we
basically tried

563
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
to ox is Google

564
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,040
fast-forward meet and it works

565
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,020
so type search command

566
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,000
and you get the result

567
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,920
the reason why is it why you see geez
these things here is that

568
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,580
the the camera is so is very

569
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,140
it has very weak CPU and water passes
the channel browser normally open slots

570
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,830
of threads

571
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:28,180
and chem Res you know it is having some
hard time serving Sam

572
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,810
you know are all together and our proxy
was

573
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,910
is also has not written in the most
optimal way was just to

574
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,820
demonstrate the proof-of-concept so

575
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,430
to this brings me back to

576
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,730
or next slide get so this is this is
just the

577
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,920
one script which lets you so

578
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,460
to with justice 1ka month for no
injecting executable

579
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,180
or for zinc that you are I or if you
want to specifically inject proxy

580
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,480
adjustable this extra steps of changing
d for some

581
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,690
Kimberly sons can't do that to

582
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:09,830
and yeah that was the demo

583
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,360
some other things to consider is how day
is the camera response to

584
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,300
denial-of-service attacks for example

585
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,550
RAM up appointed Tulare ok that's
largely because

586
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,600
which actually a application there

587
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,850
now serves taxing later and just to see

588
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,620
of course it's an embedded device and
it's not gonna handle too much

589
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,570
connections but

590
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,940
day dies after eighty eighty concurrent
connections

591
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,220
a which means it's

592
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,750
for for a bad guy if he wants to disable

593
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,290
camera functionality for a while pigeon

594
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,460
launch its you can knock it down

595
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,530
what is it like 56 seconds and keep that
those condition for as much as he wants

596
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:55,880
so

597
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,480
but OK mind plus

598
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,660
since camera doesn't smoke any on the
syndicated requests there are no traces

599
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,880
elves so

600
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,300
hotfix its I'll than you were

601
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,650
and like more expensive more advanced
versions of

602
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,960
cameras up manufactured by that falls
come now

603
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,460
I'll like starting last month they
support the HTTPS connections at least

604
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,190
for example

605
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,810
but yeah if you gonna stick with this

606
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,520
chief for versions of camera stuff mg
cameras that are

607
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,720
on their seventy dollars so I don't know
I dearly

608
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,790
i woulda I wouldn't expose to the
outside

609
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,540
for at all because you can still

610
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,670
make it to send you emails or

611
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,690
dump everything to FTP on your local
network and without exposing the camera

612
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,550
but you if you have to a that's what we
reckon we're

613
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,770
we recommend just use some

614
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,110
a box some box in front of the camera
like fire or IPS

615
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:08,100
which was run for example fail to bomb
which would fight least on the only your

616
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,250
I P or I kiss you know protect from
brute force by throttling down

617
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,930
an actual rates am you can also have a
reverse proxy

618
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,980
and you have at least finished

619
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,990
as connection between reverse proxy

620
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:29,100
and thank you sir and see I don't make
sense to overwrite response headers

621
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,580
by not saying go to our next week like
IP camera and solo striptease

622
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,180
wants play with your camera found
showdown maybe

623
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,290
and summaries

624
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,750
just for

625
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,150
actors just got another

626
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,650
told play with the camera you or
somebody else

627
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,430
owns for at me and said I would start

628
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,750
looking gets the net 35 camera Heather
because I S

629
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,120
I think there would be a lot of traffic
coming from them because

630
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,610
if you can host the mall where there

631
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:10,230
and the IQ of the camera is not
compromised will say floral

632
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,830
or Microsoft's engine

633
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:19,980
you can post your every piece of malware
on

634
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,640
different cameras since the hundreds of
thousands of them yep just

635
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,350
for traffic from those cameras regulars

636
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,390
stunt expose that would be the best
thing

637
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,690
or gets more expensive camera but who
knows

638
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,060
what other and we didn't go

639
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,470
we'd didn't do any hardware research
because firstly

640
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,580
don't have any experience in hardware
hacking and second there's a 40

641
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,390
Open Mic cam dictionary listed on the
okay last year

642
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,430
although all the references

643
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,850
yet some references open now become as a
lot of

644
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,940
are useful things but you have to have a
physical access to the camera

645
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,500
to the serial port

646
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,700
there are several tools available as
well and

647
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,020
CJ is the case also for scam

648
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,900
that's pretty much it

649
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:24,900
thank you any questions from the flow

650
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:32,369
if you were XM and Kamlesh

651
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:38,000
Qatar more expensive conserve to go
watch so we were

652
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,500
so we were just for targeting cameras
which are

653
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,579
based on this firmware normally

654
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,400
bizarre you know the low-end consumer

655
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,730
we know that the same vendors have

656
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,710
more expensive versions like outdoor
cameras

657
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,220
and things you know more sophisticated
Feb interface is it from

658
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,220
we didn't look and of those but how
about

659
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,140
the more famous brands like taxes Sony
or no

660
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,010
know we with wouldn't look into into
into any other so they're like

661
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,349
so this this

662
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:23,069
a a I don't know if if like for example
Sony or Panasonic their

663
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:26,450
is I we don't know if they're using the
same

664
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:29,470
firmware from from on science or not but

665
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,779
I don't think it's going to be like so
these are all like

666
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:37,640
old Chinese companies

667
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,799
so they're cloning 14 one company clones
another

668
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:45,519
from firmware from another imports or
chrome

669
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,099
that's why there'll

670
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:52,150
the same things thank you

671
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:59,150
any other questions

672
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,750
okay they will be rounded to the in a
conference room feat approach them

673
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,780
offstage as well thank you very much
