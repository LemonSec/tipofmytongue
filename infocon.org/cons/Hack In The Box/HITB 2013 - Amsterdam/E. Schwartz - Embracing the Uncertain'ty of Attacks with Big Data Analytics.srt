1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,930
this I'll

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:12,930
okay I'll

3
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:16,700
okay

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,360
us

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,500
thanks everybody its quite a pleasure to
be here in Amsterdam again

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,820
and to be at hack in the box which is
where my favorite things in the world

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,940
I to Tampa to talk to you about this
idea I love

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,019
embracing uncertainty because I think in
our industry we have to deal with the

9
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,190
fact that uncertainty is a way of life
for all of us

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,210
and on I took this job at Rs a

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,460
if the day after the security breach

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,920
which some you may be familiar with I
these were interesting time sit AKA

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,739
Chief Security Officer jobs

14
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:00,550
and to talk a little bit about that as
we get into itself

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,870
are some things we're gonna talk about
amid talk about

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,300
first of all security today I and

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,920
you know why should we change anything
at all and I guess the slight kinda

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,890
speaks to that

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,430
a subject I'm gonna talk about what is
big data and why it should matter tenia

20
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,250
view and what you do here

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,930
and died in a minute give some examples
for

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,350
in a big data but it is what it is
intended to

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,599
healthy lives in time for Q&A if I can
actually see anything

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,539
here so on let's talk a little bit about
security today

25
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:39,670
why change anything at all on cuz it's
all working so well for everybody right

26
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,479
on I guess I'll start with an analogy
how many have you have seen this cell

27
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,509
movie called

28
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,450
Moneyball by any chance with her Brad
Pitt any be seen at

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,489
yeah I I didn't have a good

30
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,739
footballer soccer analogy so I decided
to use baseball I know many view in

31
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,349
Europe

32
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:04,509
don't care about baseball it said see to
me baseball's about as boring as

33
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,420
football

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,979
a bite you know it's ninety minutes have
just people

35
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,280
trying to hit a little ball but the day

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,810
the movie was kinda funny CNTV side
basically the idea is this

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,660
this guy becomes the manager other
baseball team

38
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,770
and it's a losing team they're losing
all their games

39
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,800
and he has to try to make them a better
team the problem with in baseball is

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,050
you have to have cash money to do this

41
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,970
and in order to get these high-paid
players

42
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,470
you have to be able to spend lots of
cash spend lots of money to do it

43
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,910
and so mom had how do you do that

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,740
how do you do that on what is baseball
tell us

45
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,090
about anonymous well okay along came
this young guy

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,380
and he said listen you're looking at it
all wrong

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,470
II in baseball

48
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,050
the way judge a player in the old days
was based on how well you hit the ball

49
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,360
so if you hit the ball with an average
above to forty-nine

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,500
you are considered to be a really good
baseball player

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,310
and you got a higher salary and that was

52
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,440
there were other numbers but that was
the main number anything above 249 you

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,870
are good baseball player

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,240
you could get millions of dollars and of
course if you had 18 for these players

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,290
like the New York Yankees or something

56
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,080
you were you know Maki obviously a good
team in any but it is very expensive

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,700
teams again in the movie

58
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,930
this guy couldn't afford to do this
young guy came along he said well

59
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,040
those are the wrong statistics to be
looking at we should be looking at other

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,290
statistics like

61
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,480
the amount of times the person gets on
the base

62
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,230
at all the mind not have time they hit
the ball regardless

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,340
up whether they get on base and other
factors because

64
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,310
when we add up all these factors it will
mean that the team will win more often

65
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,630
no one had ever looked at the data this
way be four

66
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,250
and no one had ever brought players onto
a team

67
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,630
based on these numbers before so of
course in the movie

68
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,020
what happens is that this manager trust
this young guy

69
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,870
he acquires all these players that have
very low salaries based on these other

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,889
statistics instead of this one

71
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,240
the team is very successful they go to
the championship

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,849
they don't win but this model

73
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:32,710
which is actually true story it's called
picada becomes this statistical model

74
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,979
used to

75
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,630
identify the future performance at
sports athletes

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,980
not only in baseball but in other on

77
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,530
sports is well and notice to give an
example I pulled this off Google last

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,550
night

79
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,720
the column that I is highlighted here
these are two teams the Boston Red Sox

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,260
in New York Yankees

81
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,690
art you notice the batting averages you
again that's eight to forty nine then a

82
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,680
show do you notice the numbers are

83
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
are all over the place bite their last
three columns

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,720
ours an example love other types insists
it is sticks

85
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,770
that are used in the pic %ah to model
the model that

86
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,220
this young guy at the time put together

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,650
and you notice that in the rank order
the numbers between the batting average

88
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,050
and these other numbers don't exactly
correlate

89
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,110
right said the top batting average does
not correlate

90
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,919
two other numbers like on-base
percentage and slugging average in

91
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,280
things like that

92
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,970
and in fact if I were to call out a
couple numbers specifically here

93
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,120
are you notice on one of the players the
guy with the top batting average of

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,790
$3.10

95
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,820
has and I'll yeah an average shove 814

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,980
in one of the other figures whereas one
of the lowest averages which is a top

97
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,680
players

98
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,660
on the Yankees a batting averages 252

99
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,889
has one of the highest ratings overall

100
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,389
so he should really be the highest paid
player

101
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,370
and this model again is used in many
sports today

102
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,010
in golf in in football and in baseball

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,480
cell start thinking about this from a
security perspective because

104
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,590
if we can't do these kinds of things in
sports

105
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,340
I and why can't we do these kinds of
things in information security to start

106
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,479
predicting

107
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,389
the future activity of people that we
care about relative to attacks

108
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,530
and things of that sort their other
analogies

109
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,840
site I pulled down the hit list of my
Amazon page last night in

110
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,600
this will give you some insight into the
kind of crap that i buy

111
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,169
but you know Amazon for if thirty forty
years now has been

112
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,290
I figuring out pretty easily if you buy

113
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,580
one thing is forty other things that
you're interested in

114
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,030
and that's a very simplistic model
called the preference engine

115
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,610
grocery stores do another other type
server things do it

116
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,550
I was on my Facebook page last night
it's a picture by

117
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,919
a 13-year-old sign in the middle yeah
but are

118
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,240
one of the things I noticed on the right
is it was serving the an ad

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,389
for our martial arts some sort

120
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,460
okay so these two things I was thinking
well is it because somewhere on my

121
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,000
Facebook page i've indicated that I've
been in martial arts for a long time

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,650
because you know it also sometimes gives
me scuba diving add cinnamon to scuba

123
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,520
diving rated

124
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,650
you know that's very simplistic but I
also looks further down in my Facebook

125
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,690
page

126
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,550
and I noticed that I had a picture I
love my son

127
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,919
getting his black belt in Taekwondo and
there were other references to Taekwondo

128
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,090
and on the page so again the question is
to what degree

129
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,850
is this type of information data mind as
well whether it's

130
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,020
recognition a different patterns
visually your

131
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,509
just information that's posted as you
know I love this information

132
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,900
is is day to mind is part of an
advertising process

133
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,960
again if this type of work is easily
done

134
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,130
why can't we do this type of work
relative to things we care about and

135
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,009
security

136
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,740
should be very very easy for us to do to
some degree

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,350
welp one of the problems is that

138
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,220
security maybe 12-13 years ago for the
most part

139
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,750
moved away from what I would call a
technical discipline

140
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,060
and moved to a discipline in general
that

141
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,610
are requires certainty verses
uncertainty

142
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,620
and certainty goes around the idea of

143
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,969
audit right here's a checklist

144
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,389
follow this checklist everything's okay

145
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,699
you good to go necking manifests itself
in a lot of different ways for example

146
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,040
depending upon where you live maybe you
believe that

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,619
ISO 27001 you follow some regimen

148
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,800
you have your check lists are program
you have

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,249
some goal for ISO 27001 when you meet
those goals

150
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:10,170
you got a good security program
according to some peoples estimation

151
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,899
I would argue with that it's a buncha
crap but

152
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:17,230
I some people feel that that's certainty

153
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,470
on and unfortunately that's what

154
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,050
a level of management in a lot of our
companies believe to be true

155
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,240
right they bring in auditors who will
come and

156
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,050
they'll do an assessment I'll see if
only you were using this

157
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,240
you would be okay or you would be
measurable

158
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,480
in some way when we know that even if we
did everything

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,879
here or another regulations we would
still

160
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,470
be vulnerable on even if we're and

161
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,189
countless numbers a vulnerability scans
every day

162
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,800
it wouldn't matter and it's a complete
waste of time for the most part

163
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,470
so certainty is something people want
we've been building certainty in other

164
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,499
ways into our

165
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:04,529
systems as well if you think about a
classic doctrine in security you know

166
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,199
this whole prevent detect respond think

167
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,519
I'm sure many view from there with how
much money

168
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,199
and time do we spend on prevention
you're trying to make bad things go away

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,559
I firewalls IPS AVG all this other stuff
rate

170
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,929
so this is how the bad guys see the
prevent

171
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:30,670
side of what we're trying to do we spend
a lot of money and prevent

172
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,709
and you know the restive it is sorta
visible cell again

173
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,999
this is where the certainty comes into
the picture

174
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,449
but do you worry about the uncertainty

175
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:48,959
right what happens to the things that
you can't feel good about here

176
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,410
now you know sorry if this season

177
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,579
bothers anybody 1 I'm really sorry and
give a shit if it bothers you or not

178
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,879
few black invites but they the reality
is that

179
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,639
you know were trying to say well you
know if only I use custom start rules I

180
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,029
do this or do that you know

181
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,569
likes gonna be okay most of this stuff
it doesn't matter I mean

182
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,959
how many as you have had a breach in
your firewall on the last seven or eight

183
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,139
years

184
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:20,879
I I mean I don't know anybody who has
and if you have you you shouldn't be

185
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,129
working in this industry anymore

186
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,480
me get up go work in a grocery store or
something the

187
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,939
the reality is that this isn't the
problem honey what we need to do is take

188
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,540
all of this stuff

189
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,249
and just drive the cost at effect
because that's not where the problem is

190
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,290
today

191
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,529
so it this is not providing us any
certainty

192
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:43,819
if we were to put a value on any these
technologies are this approaches and say

193
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,709
well

194
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,899
what percentage do have certainty do I
believe this is gonna protect me

195
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,139
AV your IPS firewall next generation now
where this is that whatever

196
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,749
he it's not gonna do it we've also been
told anybody know who these three guys

197
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,639
are

198
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,980
if they now come on really

199
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,040
silly always does okay at a their

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,860
fear uncertainty and doubt we've always
been told in this industry don't sell

201
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,480
what you do based on these three guys
fear uncertainty and doubt I'm here to

202
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,679
tell you that you need to sell

203
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:31,199
this based on this because the reality
is that people should be afraid

204
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,649
they should have doubts and most
importantly we need to embrace

205
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,589
uncertainty

206
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:40,329
because we don't know what's going to
happen tomorrow

207
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:46,629
do you know white new things microsite
did you see the latest Microsoft thing

208
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,670
at in the last couple days I mean we
don't know

209
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,980
white is going to happen with Adobe we
don't know what's gonna happen with any

210
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,689
vendor we don't know I'll

211
00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:01,290
what the latest attacks going to be we
don't know when are companies going to

212
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,049
do in to see their political position
from one day to the next

213
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,389
that's going to create some kinda
situation

214
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:13,410
where we can be subject to activists
attacks or other types of attacks

215
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,860
uncertainty is something we need to
embrace

216
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,769
this is guy eat Nate Silver Nate Silver
is the guy from that movie

217
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,489
remember that part that the young guy
played in the Moneyball they talked

218
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:28,209
about

219
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,519
is actually based on a real guy called
Nate Silver &

220
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,410
he has a book in in the book there's a
quote is Cesar recognize the omens

221
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,639
he just didn't think they applied to him
okay

222
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,369
he was getting some information
somewhere that somebody's gonna come and

223
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,749
staff

224
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:49,369
but it wasn't listening and we have this
information to

225
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:54,309
we just need to to learn how to deal
with it in some way

226
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:59,170
so there is a price that we're gonna pay
for all this chaos in turbulence

227
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,799
in our industry and in what we're doing
but we have to learn to embrace it we

228
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,100
have to learn to accept the fact that
it's a way of life

229
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,249
and I think that if we accept that if
you don't do anything this year read

230
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:12,410
this book

231
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,759
because it will help you understand that
we need more data

232
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,980
we need more analytics and we need to
accept the fact that we need to move out

233
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,720
at this limited world in which we view
things

234
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,589
into a bigger world now part of that

235
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:30,879
is starting with some some ideas

236
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,049
the first idea is that threat models
need to change

237
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,649
when we think about the adversarial
landscape

238
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,759
how much intelligence do we really have
about who the attackers are

239
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,119
and what they really want everybody says
I A and all this stuff

240
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,389
what you doing about it how many have
you have

241
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:55,929
a model that's implemented in your
security program

242
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,239
that's dynamic that really looks at the
adversarial landscape

243
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:05,670
and can link the adversarial landscape
to specific campaigns in attacks

244
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,480
if you have that and you're doing it and
your updating it on a constant basis

245
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,259
then you get

246
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:14,769
but is if you just are saying is sitting
there saying well

247
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,429
yeah I know about all that stuff but you
actually haven't implemented

248
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:22,989
and intelligence base process to
understand this and you not doing it

249
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,879
okay if you're not bringing any
information

250
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,959
and tracking specific groups and
starting to understand how they operate

251
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,819
for real then you're not doing this okay
and it's easy to just talk about this

252
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,139
but it's it's another thing to do it

253
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,249
and insiders is is is really tricky
especially if you're a net

254
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:48,119
a year a multinational company

255
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:52,549
there's venues like to talk about me she
stayed in all their survey points to one

256
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:53,809
country all the time when

257
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:58,329
when they talk about it publicly arm you
there was a recent to

258
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,689
mandiant reports APT 1 I'm sure love you

259
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:05,439
I saw that report people who have been
Traci

260
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:09,939
adversaries for some time familiar with
all the indicators a compromise in every

261
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:10,669
port

262
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:16,189
actually have a preview of the year the
next mandiant report on APT 2d

263
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:19,730
you wanna see it and they wanna see a

264
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,249
okay this is it

265
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,769
I'm just kidding it's not really a

266
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,649
Elton John in the corner for those see
the town you know who it is

267
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,399
alright guys have no sense a humor SP
Amsterdam

268
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,989
alright

269
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:43,559
alright so how do we start looking at
data differently

270
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:48,220
there is data I have bad guys that we
understand this is the security model

271
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,720
that we understand

272
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,980
from the old days these guys show up at
your door

273
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,579
we know they're bad it's pretty obvious
rate to get guns in

274
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:02,079
you know they look me and that's the
model that were used to that's what I P

275
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,389
S Navy does

276
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,189
we already have the signature we have a
rule

277
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,329
it says look for guys with guns it's a
finite dataset

278
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,179
with known questions its easy everybody
understands that right

279
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,419
the model that we're going for however
is a different one

280
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,130
the different one is that there's
everybody's dressed the same

281
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,390
in this case like Elvis Presley and

282
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,070
there's thousands have them but one of
them

283
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,270
has a bomb strapped to their chest and
all we know is that

284
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,170
everybody's dressed like Elvis Presley
or sooner we think that's all we know

285
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,590
but the reality is that there are other
data points we have that we haven't

286
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,080
looked at before

287
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,210
similar to the baseball analogy and sell

288
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,950
rather than a finite dataset we have
infinite amounts of data potentially

289
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,510
available to us that we need to bring in

290
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,730
we have unknown questions tomorrow it's

291
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,870
the elvis impersonators the next day
it's something else

292
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,920
we have till be agile and learn how to
ask those questions

293
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,280
and then we have to have a way to
process this information

294
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,230
so that means technology and it means
skills

295
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,620
that maybe we don't have on our security
teams

296
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,700
everybody still trying to figure out
who's going to do them our reversing for

297
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,640
them

298
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,480
their new skills you need beyond that

299
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,410
there's a lot to talk in this industry
about this idea of the kill chain

300
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,750
I'm sure you've heard that a thousand
times already till I

301
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,760
I stole this slide from Greg Hoglund it

302
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,250
used to be HB Gary on

303
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,780
however you want to think about APT's
think about this idea I've

304
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,180
adversarial phases right some sort of
intelligence-gathering are planning an

305
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,180
attack

306
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,400
creation exploit delivery exploitation

307
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,970
command-and-control actions on its hands
might do some

308
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,710
phases have an attack 7 820 pick a
number of phases it doesn't matter

309
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,980
whatever model you use what's
interesting to me from the Big Data

310
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,370
perspective

311
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,960
is that as your defenses fail

312
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,920
as the preventive solutions that you've
implemented fail

313
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,080
the cost to you increases

314
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,550
okay that cost could be you running
around with your hair on fire

315
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,990
trying to figure out what's wrong
calling it: people calling your friends

316
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,830
everywhere

317
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,750
trying to understand what's going on or
true losses to your organization

318
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,390
terms money intellectual property top
secret information whatever it is that

319
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,860
you

320
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,760
are responsible for so that's that top
red triangle there

321
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,730
as you know once the adversary moves
into your environment

322
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,740
the automation level decreases generally

323
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,960
and now you're dealing with more
hands-on keyboard

324
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,690
lateral movement net commands different
types of activities said

325
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,180
that potentially are more visible to:

326
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,410
even if you can't see everything inside
those activities because if encryption

327
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,870
or other types in

328
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,860
obfuscation techniques there's a level
of visibility that's potentially there

329
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,260
and that's where the opportunity is for
us with

330
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,770
big data because it's in that sweet spot
where the circle is that we have to

331
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,660
decide

332
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,940
what resources do we need to apply here

333
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,680
in terms of acquiring data and in terms
of analyzing that data

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,870
so what is that University information
that belongs

335
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,210
their internal to our organization

336
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,660
and externally in terms of collaboration

337
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,950
with people you know within a the sector
that you belong to for example

338
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,020
government financial services energy

339
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,580
telecom high-tech whatever it is you
deal

340
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,900
and then bring that together in a
machine-readable form in some

341
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,440
a timely manner because time really
matters here

342
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,310
one of the problems that we have is that

343
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,330
suppose you you doing what you do and
now you say well I yeah I i wanna do

344
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,540
this I want to get better

345
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,050
at this gap it you know in this little
circle here

346
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,090
where's the money come from

347
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,060
me can't is going to give give give me
five million euros

348
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,800
I don't know how that works in your
organization that doesn't work well in

349
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
mine

350
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,860
arm a you seen diagrams like this before

351
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,640
this is not to illustrate the hard on
the outside

352
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,580
soft and chewy on the inside thank this
is still a straight

353
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,700
where the money goes go back

354
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,780
and ask the question where do you spend
money on security

355
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,220
really decompose that budget and take it
apart and say

356
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,810
what do we spend on for a better defense
where we spend on

357
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,200
EV whether we spend on IPS

358
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,480
whether we spend on everything that
looks like a preventive solution

359
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,850
the big Wall around the picnic castle
there

360
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,980
the town add up all that money

361
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,930
and then ask yourself what percentage is
success

362
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,120
what percentage of certainty does that
provide you

363
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,330
that's that that's interesting enough

364
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,050
on then ask yourself in terms of
detection

365
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,630
which might be the little towers that
are around in the big tower there

366
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,640
how much you spending to detect

367
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,280
at the lateral movement for example

368
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,660
how much you spending to respond because

369
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,950
in the moment when you realize okay

370
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,570
there's been an exploit there's been a
delivery have some sort there's

371
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,620
command-and-control activity

372
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,870
how much money do you have to deal with
that part of it

373
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,850
and then to do the analytics and the
trend analysis in the intelligence work

374
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,900
that you need to do

375
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,760
after you discover all this

376
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,710
do that math and see how it shakes out
now tell you how it shakes out based on

377
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,860
some research that we did

378
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,130
that eighty percent have budgets go to
prevention

379
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,730
and this is based on he with the call
global 2000 companies about 250

380
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,290
companies we had when he's

381
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,460
big you know research firms do this
fifty percent for monitoring so the tech

382
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,560
side

383
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,400
and then 5 percent for response

384
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,910
now keep in mind a lot of things going
to prevention right you know the

385
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,720
vulnerability scanning configuration

386
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,470
all this kind of stuff security training

387
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,570
all love that sell now but

388
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,490
what is the right balance if you were to
say I don't like that

389
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,790
because I don't give I don't think a
deeper sense the right number what is

390
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,040
the right number if you wanted to start

391
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,800
thinking well I could use big data to
solve some of these problems when it

392
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,580
what what he thinks the right number

393
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,140
and there's no right answer here because
it's gonna be a different answer for

394
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,570
each review

395
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,030
well i i don't know yeah let's suppose
just for the sake of argument

396
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,250
it was 130 each

397
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,660
how do you get there from here you can't
just go from

398
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,120
you 2012 2013 and make that change

399
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,630
that's not gonna happen it's it's a big
transition

400
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,910
in terms have the way you do things in a
lot of different ways by

401
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:34,700
on you know obviously it is something to
think about

402
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,410
in terms of you know rethinking your
security budget somebody needs to think

403
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,710
about this

404
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,900
alright so let's talk about big data
because

405
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,330
big data is really how you started
dressing the part in this equation

406
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:56,330
which is uncertainty

407
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,960
so I've been there you know this job for
two years and

408
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,990
one of the things that I had to figure
out after this security breaches

409
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,090
saddam how do we stop doing traditional
security work

410
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,840
where I work on it was classic
environment where

411
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,810
on your people were running at ISO 27001

412
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,870
running at a lot of different compliance
functions doing

413
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,320
you know vulnerability scanning doing
everything that you might imagine in a

414
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,910
security program

415
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,020
you know and NY and then what happens

416
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,990
cell what do you what do you start to do
differently

417
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,930
you know in in the if you look at some
other that again a lot of the money was

418
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,920
in that prevent bucket

419
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,750
there are things that you stop doing
right away for example he stopped doing

420
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,800
ISO 27001 across-the-board

421
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,220
on not meeting that you don't tried it
have good security policies and tried it

422
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,700
make them successful but the point is if
somebody says well we

423
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,900
we need to be ISO 27001 across the world

424
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,460
just because why when I could use that
money for other purposes

425
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,810
so I think there are four areas that I
started to focus on initially in terms

426
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,280
and looking at how

427
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,900
I could get better view into how

428
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,250
I you could use big data the first was
security management

429
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,390
how can I get better visibility into
everything that's happening

430
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,880
you know it especially in terms have the
behavior of users the behaviour devices

431
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,780
things of that sort and look for
standard deviations from good behavior

432
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,720
now looking for bad so much to me we
already knew how to look for bad

433
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,040
as far as a new but looking for for
deviations from

434
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,730
good and the second area was in fraud

435
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,460
we had done you know we have a lot of
businesses where we have to deal with

436
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,100
fraud and so how do you how do you do
that

437
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,890
and the third area was an on
authentication

438
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,030
and dad you know user ID's passwords in

439
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,060
what constitutes add the speedo

440
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,110
authentication events and other factors
like that

441
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,170
and the fourth was how we track the
controls

442
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:17,060
in our in our infrastructure and drives
a control structure to provide

443
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,290
intelligence to everything else

444
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,340
and the talk a little bit about on all
that

445
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,400
when you do this you've got a set some
specific goals for yourself

446
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,140
rate because imagine when you go to
accompany anyone to change everything

447
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,870
that

448
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,390
that they're doing he can't just dumb go
in and done

449
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,710
you know say I'm gonna change everything
they have to get on board with some

450
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,380
basic ideas cell

451
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,840
there were some ideas that we put out
there the first was that I wanted to

452
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,480
have visibility into everything

453
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,730
if you think about the way we view data
and security

454
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,640
what are some things that we use in 8 to
look at data right

455
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,590
logs I but the logs that we were viewing
in security were like security logs

456
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,950
I Windows server logs you know either
takes a server logs

457
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,420
network device logs and and they're all
supposedly security specific

458
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,750
but if if you work with logs at all but

459
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,559
there's not much in them really and the
need you know they have a limited amount

460
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,440
data so we had to go out and say what
constitutes that University information

461
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,230
that I showed you on that kill chain
slider earlier that is useful and it

462
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,020
goes beyond security lots its business
transaction logs

463
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,470
full packet data it's its information
from

464
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,680
you know asset management systems HR
systems travel systems

465
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,100
things like that which means creating
data definitions for those environments

466
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,809
and finding ways to parse that into a
data warehouse I'll talk about

467
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:51,990
data warehouse in a bit more later um

468
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,290
actionable intelligence we had to figure
out what information

469
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:02,170
we need now and then what information we
could wait a little bit more for

470
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,880
an of any view use Mike security
information and event management systems

471
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,350
like

472
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:13,550
the when we have our time the other
vendors but they're all slow

473
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:18,490
don't week anyway now but I mean they
are you know and and the problem is that

474
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,880
like okay there's things that you need
to know right now

475
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,020
and then there's things that that you
know

476
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,990
are you can wait a little bit cell again
the paradigm shift wise

477
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,220
how do we organize that data in a way

478
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,250
that is actionable out talk about that
too

479
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,059
agility was important because we need to
be able to change things

480
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,809
right right new parsers rate new data
definitions wherever

481
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,130
on introduce new languages use
open-source

482
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,900
we wanted to do all that stuff and we do
we want to be locked into any vendor

483
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,400
solutions including our own

484
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,670
on and centralize incident management

485
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,550
10 that things that we also we're
dealing with was the fact that when we

486
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,530
did have our hair on fire

487
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,059
within wanna be dependent another group

488
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,730
for information if that makes sense to
you and I think if you encounter this

489
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,710
but when you

490
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,160
are in the middle evidence sent to run
around and try to get the network people

491
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,160
to talk to you are the windows people or
whoever

492
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,430
very hard especially if you speak
security and they speak networking IT

493
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,550
year whatever

494
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,920
doesn't always work out very well on

495
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,309
there are other problems so let's talk a
little bit about the visibility problem

496
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:36,790
on disjoint sets

497
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,320
if you have in infrastructure that's
grown up over time

498
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,440
it doesn't work well together rate for
example if you doing logging

499
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,490
may have locking up host and network

500
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,309
and different types of environments
where if you try to bring data together

501
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,910
just look from for example from layer 3
to layer 7

502
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:02,200
you'll see that just the definitions
have certain elements in those datasets

503
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,320
don't match up very well there's no
normalization

504
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,870
user ID is is a different thing in
different datasets

505
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,130
and that creates bottlenecks if you
think about it when I go to write a

506
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,390
query

507
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,510
the first thing that has to happen is I
have to resolve those differences in the

508
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,880
data schema

509
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,880
say the resolve them at the time of day
to capture

510
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,470
why resolve them at the time that the
query or I resolve them some other time

511
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,880
somewhere in there

512
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,660
right when do I do that so so this is a
problem

513
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,550
any in you as you start adding more data
for example for packet capture

514
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,710
host in memory forensics and things of
that sort

515
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,670
it becomes a much greater problem with
you different storage silos imagine if

516
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,059
you're geographically dispersed
organization we have multiple data

517
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,030
centers

518
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,280
on and you can't do this over over I
mean if you have all the ban within the

519
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,410
world it's very tricky to do this

520
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,429
so their architectural considerations
that you have to think about

521
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:05,770
relative to how you acquire data what a
pup reminding occurs on that data

522
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,320
where normalization occurs and what data
schema look like see have apples to

523
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,690
apples entities at the right time

524
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,600
and this is a fundamental problem that
needs to be resolved

525
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,040
in terms data management when you
thinking about Big Data

526
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,870
to other problems have to do with event
management and search

527
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,900
historically cm has not been optimized
to very large data searches

528
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,390
in the same with search tools like
Splunk you can't

529
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,380
on say you'll go look at this 100
terabytes of data and give me a result

530
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,100
in an ad hoc search it's very hard to do

531
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,080
I have you ever tried on especially
unstructured data

532
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,210
so again you know how do you create a
situation

533
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,780
where you can have manageable rules
running manageable parsing

534
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,300
and things of that sort and we can set
that up is part of that infrastructure

535
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,000
and were searching makes sense and then
of course there's the issue I love

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,809
intelligence I'm sure many if you are

537
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:11,910
you participating in the intelligence
life cycle in some way or another

538
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,700
where you're getting you no idea at a
basic level for example indicators a

539
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,890
compromise

540
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,960
you maybe you're pulling bad IP address
lists or domain lists from somewhere

541
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,380
you maybe have access to very privileged
data maybe you take the lead layer 7

542
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,840
I data you regarding now where or file
integrity data from somewhere

543
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,140
that's great but to look at that data

544
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,270
at the end of the life cycle not so much

545
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,480
use as as taking it at the inception

546
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,390
right when you're doing full packet
capture or analyzing lots or business

547
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,350
data

548
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,090
it would be great to join that data
right at the time he captured

549
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:55,010
right again how do you organize this in
such a way that you can

550
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,679
you can get that done so these are
problems that you have to solving

551
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,820
and you know there is a critical and you
need a road map to be able to deal with

552
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,640
this

553
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,659
from a process perspective one of the
things you have to ask yourself to is

554
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,770
do you wanna run a security operation
center where do you wanna run something

555
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,480
more than that

556
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,800
on act I have the interesting position
in this job

557
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,579
mind to be able to visit a lot of
companies

558
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,450
you know I it's one of the great things
about this job and I get to see where

559
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,629
people deal

560
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,049
the good the bad and the ugly and

561
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:36,220
you know a lot of people are very happy

562
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,489
that they have a sock and it they should
be

563
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,179
but a lot of sock Sox are set up

564
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,859
to wear they have a %uh a tool of some
sort

565
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:50,549
and the way for that tool to pop up
something look at this

566
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,989
look at this look at this you know boom
boom boom boom

567
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:58,480
and the problem is that if you think
about how Sam is organized

568
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,640
most sims are looking at some
correlation a firewall

569
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,220
and and lock events based on

570
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,900
known signatures see you dealing with
things that we already knew any

571
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,049
the attackers already knew and
correlated events based on that

572
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,440
now I'm not saying that for certain
classes have

573
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,720
attacks that's not useful information
for example exception to authentication

574
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,220
events and meets in

575
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,710
rules are very interesting in that
regard but

576
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,059
if your team is looking at certain types
in the vents

577
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:34,470
related for example to web application
problems

578
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,930
I it's not necessarily very useful
compared to

579
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,079
the exploit space that's out there cell

580
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,440
arm a lot of that stuff that goes on
there

581
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,680
could either be pushed out to somebody
else to do.

582
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,160
more cheaply I'll course if somehow

583
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,999
the cost given out of it but I call it
waiting for a smack on the head

584
00:35:55,999 --> 00:36:00,950
compared to the other area where you
really more focused on

585
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,390
taking them the battle to the bad guy
you know hunting for malware

586
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,210
hunting for its you know things on your
network in some sort

587
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,259
I'll understanding the threat
environment the adversarial space and I

588
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,420
talked about

589
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,779
and gaining those core skills now I
realize that

590
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:21,210
some you work in small organizations
where you like how I

591
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,450
how do i do all this stuff well that's
why you need to find partners that can

592
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,450
help you with some

593
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,730
this and the we have a pretty large
security team but we still find

594
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,220
certain skills are difficult to maintain
and we've

595
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,440
we look very closely defy to find

596
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,910
and there's so many people here in this
room to find people that can do

597
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:46,220
this work for us when you start thinking
about intelligence

598
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,930
you've got it realize that there's a
journey to get there you can't go from

599
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,009
not using external intelligence to be

600
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:57,019
you know some kind cyber profit as I
call it

601
00:36:57,019 --> 00:37:00,220
and I put some examples in here for

602
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,900
you're sort of how and another hard to
see in the back but

603
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,739
you for example you're an ad hoc user
Intel have intelligence

604
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,369
if you find out about exploits by
reading Computerworld

605
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,779
or some sorta publication and no offense
taken journalists and around this just

606
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:19,170
you know if that's how you find out
about exploits well

607
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,489
okay got some work to do on

608
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:26,119
in the US we have these things called
ice axe incident sharing and analysis

609
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,960
centers in these are collaborative

610
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,460
and cities among trusted partners within
a sector says

611
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,339
example the bank's working with each
other energy companies and so on

612
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,829
they tend to share information more
readily about things that are happening

613
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:40,470
to each other

614
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,960
cell maybe you're getting that
information but you're not necessarily

615
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,470
acting upon it many proactive way

616
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:53,739
if you're an end-user the information
you might be taking this information

617
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:59,190
and inserting it into your tools and ask
your tools to look for this in some way

618
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,539
you look for an indicator look for some
signature pattern or or whatever it is

619
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:04,349
that you

620
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:09,220
you got your hands on in some way on

621
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,460
if you're a creator I've information
you've

622
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,329
you you've actually on the other side of
the kill chain where your synthesizing

623
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,289
attacks you

624
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:20,619
discovered an attack somewhere and
progress perhaps

625
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:24,430
endured looking at the end that your
understanding tools tactics and

626
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,279
procedures the adversary

627
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:29,999
and your crew and you're contributing
that information to the community you

628
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,529
belong to

629
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:35,380
so you actually creating intelligence
that you share with others

630
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,249
are you writing your own rules
synthesizing data

631
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:43,869
and cyber profit it's more a joke than
anything by

632
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:48,249
this is where the EV companies come to
you they get information from you and

633
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:53,579
and they make believe it's their own
information

634
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,809
90 this is kind of the night chart bite

635
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:01,369
arm I I and I don't usually use lights
like this but I put this in here and

636
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,579
I'll send this to anybody who wants it

637
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,989
because I use this internally to I

638
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:10,849
judge where we are with certain advanced
capabilities

639
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:15,180
relative to the not the sock but the
other I think that we're doing

640
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,529
and you have to decide what's right for
you

641
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:22,579
I'll when you start to use big data and
you start to evolve certain capabilities

642
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,529
like forensics

643
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,410
advance incident response having a
threat intelligence team

644
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,559
and so on what are the capabilities that
you want for example in threat

645
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,880
intelligence

646
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,400
under Advanced I have detailed campaign
analysis

647
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,140
what does that mean well to me what that
means on my team

648
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,930
is that we have people that are
dedicated to analyzing

649
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,749
email attacks that's all they do the
analyze email attacks

650
00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:54,529
the only thing they deal and then when
the analyze those attacks

651
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:57,730
they try to you connect the dots between
those attacks

652
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,829
and specific adversarial campaigns

653
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:06,210
and those campaigns are identified by
campaign code numbers

654
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:11,359
that's that's real work any and and they
work with other special teams

655
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,700
post forensics network forensics now
where reversers

656
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,440
some of which are employees Avars some
of which are

657
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
people such as yourselves to do this for
you know either is independent

658
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,309
consultants or as part of the company

659
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:29,539
right cell where do you need to be on
this

660
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:34,380
depends depends on if you your company
makes use

661
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,079
now you need to be at the bottom that
this chart but

662
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,690
if you're if you work in a year in
intelligence

663
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,549
intelligence service for the government
you probably do need to be at the bottom

664
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:49,470
this chart

665
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,630
weird teams are the best teams and I
agree with that

666
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,579
I this is a picture of what my weird
team looks like

667
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:00,589
on before the

668
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:04,289
the breach was just the box on the far
right

669
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:09,289
so that was the old sock that's what it
look like tier 1 tier 2

670
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:13,170
24 by 7 eyes on glass hit you on the
head

671
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,529
have a nice day okay now lots a special
teams

672
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:21,660
now Reversi cause our origin
determination

673
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,200
on we do a lot of social media work

674
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,049
internally and externally terms have
attack surface profiling

675
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:33,979
all the social media information comes
into my data warehouse

676
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:38,789
and it's analyzed against all odds the
internal data that I have

677
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:42,999
arm we do a lot of um actually bution

678
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:47,710
we do a lot of reviews internally
high-value targets

679
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,059
and try to make connections between
campaigns and high-value targets

680
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,509
we constantly evaluate how r tools are
working

681
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:58,690
and look at what tools we should be
emphasized

682
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,700
or what tools we should spend more money
on

683
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,329
and we have people that are updating
parsers in rules and and things of that

684
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:09,989
sort

685
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:13,130
this is a notional architecture

686
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,099
what goes into this first of all the
idea of collection

687
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:22,140
you have to commit to some idea of
collecting data

688
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,680
right arm

689
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,109
one of the tricky parts has been to move
away from this idea disparity collection

690
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:35,979
to say we're gonna collect everything on
a prioritized list I've got a list

691
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:40,660
about a dozen categories data that I
wanna call act

692
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,039
I don't know how to get there from here
on some of them yet

693
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:48,319
I'm gonna give you an example SAP data I
don't know how to get there from here

694
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,839
yet

695
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,329
I mean I know how to look at SAP logs
and I since I love you already know how

696
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:55,819
to do that too that's that's the easy
part

697
00:42:55,819 --> 00:42:59,680
but how do you get in the middle are
those transactions

698
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,220
and look for deviations from good
because it's hard for business people to

699
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,819
explain to me

700
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:10,140
what a bad SAP transaction I mean it
some other obvious

701
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,549
but rate when things seem to be going
well

702
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:19,339
I'm not sure right so these are think
these are challenges but but but

703
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,940
I have a list and I want everything on
that list and I i so I

704
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,940
I have the I'd collection architecture

705
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,989
data warehouse Apache Hadoop

706
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:33,819
okay why well scale-out

707
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,609
n-tier architecture with inexpensive
equipment

708
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:40,650
I can add storage to the end of time to
it

709
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,309
and processors to the end of time night
it keeps killing at Forever

710
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:49,329
I can add full context text searching
with

711
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:52,349
Lucy I can add Esper

712
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:56,579
I can add all kinds of cool stuff to it
and I can add

713
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,029
cots vendor solutions to it

714
00:44:00,029 --> 00:44:03,569
I can plug it into my Sam I can plug it
into

715
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,079
you know the art say stuff that I have I
can plug it into third-party

716
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,119
vendor solutions that I have on

717
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,569
and that's cool and with the Hadoop
stuff I can do a lot of the pre

718
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,690
mining that I talk to you about I can
set up a cluster

719
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,099
I give it a buncha tasks and i can tell
it to run to the end of time

720
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:26,119
and and and this is important when you
thinking about large amounts of data

721
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,569
right with never we talked earlier about
the fact that well how do I integrate

722
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,880
information when you're dealing with
hundreds of terabytes of data

723
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,729
it's easy if you start dedicating HDFS

724
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:42,700
clusters to ease say keep going keep
doing this keep doing this

725
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,880
and you know the good thing about that
environment as I can just keep snapping

726
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,549
in

727
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:49,650
additional libraries additional
capabilities to it

728
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,069
but that's where I'm storing months in
years

729
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:56,890
data log data and meta-data from the
full packet environment

730
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,660
business data and so on real-time
environments a bit different

731
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,670
in that environment that's where I need
the full context

732
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,829
a full packet information but you know
as you know on a

733
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:11,369
on a on a large network you keep for
packet data too long

734
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,009
cell you know they are you dealing with
you maybe a seven to 14 day horizon

735
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:20,869
but you still want a common meta-data
infrastructure that's normalized

736
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:24,650
with all your other data so that when
you search for something

737
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,079
as an analyst you don't have to know and
I like he had a la Torre

738
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,229
full packet artifacts you're searching
for something you get a result

739
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,599
and then it's only when you dig into the
data that you realize

740
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,640
all and looking at reconstructed for
packet sessions are looking at a lot

741
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,569
artifact

742
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:45,619
from I'll use something else does that
make sense

743
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:49,180
he on and there's other plugins he could
do the if you see on the day

744
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,799
on the far right this is box it's his
ass a criticality

745
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:57,880
the idea is how do you start connecting
the dots between this environment

746
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,239
and understanding if you've got pick a
number

747
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:06,089
100000 IT assets which have those are
the most important ones

748
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:10,089
which have those fell out of patch or
configuration management

749
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:14,769
and have that be yet another
intelligence feed into the process

750
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:17,839
because that's the way he should just
read that is just intelligence

751
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:24,809
feed any to speed up a little bit here

752
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:30,470
ok you get the idea

753
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,460
so there's a lot of stuff you could do
it this me now you can create

754
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,749
yeah I'm have an example here they just
do together

755
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:43,009
for name pipes %ah you many view
probably familiar with this idea but

756
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:46,759
on for example in this environment

757
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:49,809
%uh distances right outta my environment

758
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,380
you wanna the things we look for is
weird I named pipes

759
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,269
okay very easy to create parsers that
just

760
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:03,499
just basically catalog I I don't know
what's bad by the way

761
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:06,589
i mean to you I don't know what all
valid name

762
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:09,910
pipes are maybe someday you do because
you're smarter than I am in

763
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,950
can prolly name every single file in the
Windows

764
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,140
operating system I don't know but and
Hannah these things

765
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,720
but is very easy for example to at least

766
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,569
call out things on the network so he is
a very simple parser

767
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:27,970
you know here's how it works basically
just you

768
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:33,069
offset a few bites okay figure out the
name there blah blah blah

769
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:36,609
success capture some packets and then
bone you've got

770
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,049
you know a list the stuff here right now
again

771
00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:44,849
I could have a parser like this running
till the end of time

772
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:47,869
if in this sock nobody would ever look
at it

773
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,219
II in the new world order that I've
created

774
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:56,170
on people do you actually look at this
so I have rules that call outs

775
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,489
differences here and differences are
things

776
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:04,140
like this

777
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,690
me again there might be something like
that for real and

778
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,420
you know Windows I don't know maybe bite
arm

779
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,049
maybe not so this is something worth
investigating

780
00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:18,279
on the other is that on

781
00:48:18,279 --> 00:48:21,549
what we're starting to do is look at
Esper

782
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:24,729
for complex event processing the data
warehouse

783
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:28,339
where once we understand using this
parser

784
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:33,229
for good make okay so we see all these
pipes

785
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:38,170
we overtime we know what they are you
know we see number of hits

786
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,910
when we see now c3 hits on pipes slash

787
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,920
lol bank it triggers it standard
deviation

788
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,029
now 33 may not seem like a big number
for you but three for this would be an

789
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,289
acceptable number

790
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:57,339
one would probably be acceptable number
whereas in other categories maybe it's

791
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:01,430
twenty-year thousand who knows you know
I don't know

792
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,069
it's with data scientists do figure that
shit out

793
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:08,859
now but the point is that that these are
things you do

794
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:12,839
me we we haven't so we have a lot of
stuff like that that we're working on is

795
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:13,859
just a

796
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,369
you know had how to figure this stuff
out and as you

797
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:21,759
look at this this problem you need is a
very simple problem like this

798
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,130
i've seen this type of stuff on the wire

799
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,799
then you go well okay you know what else

800
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:33,059
would you add to this beyond just the
simple

801
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:36,819
data science and looking for deviations
like going well okay

802
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:41,390
now I can parse all the pipes now I can
look for deviations from

803
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,599
a population of good you know for
example here's

804
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,890
you know here's a week or day %um prolly

805
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:51,049
days enough data for this environment
here's a day

806
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:55,039
information here's a deviation now how
can I

807
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,559
eliminate false positives in that
environment you hear some examples

808
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,190
wat listing on external intelligence

809
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,489
right where you know you put out there
has anyone seen

810
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:09,710
yes you get answers back yes i've seen

811
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,569
yes and then you would either blacklist
waitlisted

812
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:16,650
based on that many guys do this all the
time stuff

813
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,410
and and so on

814
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:25,269
there's more to this I in the Big Data
box

815
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:28,940
I mean what else is in there there

816
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,619
everything is going to transform because
we've only been talking about like

817
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:33,979
incident response in

818
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:36,989
really basic stuff like that but if you
think about it

819
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:41,009
authentication has to transform you the
fried stuff

820
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:44,460
although this has to has to go cell

821
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,769
you know there's this whole life cycle
that the we've had in security did

822
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,519
we've kinda been doing in silos that I
wanna see converge in some way

823
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,559
and I don't know how to do it yet
because I can't build

824
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:00,369
too many things off of the reservation I
get in trouble so we have to

825
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:03,519
we have to have products to do it but

826
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:09,150
just some ideas rate we know that
username and password is gonna die soon

827
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:13,869
which would die tomorrow on two-factor
authentication

828
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:19,690
who knows where that goes I don't know
we use your phone your eyeballs here

829
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:25,859
and which use but I I do like the idea
of some combination of elements coming

830
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,430
into play

831
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:31,150
you know we looked a lot it's different
things you're looking at speedo

832
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,079
authentication events geo related

833
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:38,950
collectivity if you know you login here
than here than here you know

834
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,759
it is just too too fast be you know any
Jews

835
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:47,460
your terms ground speed and things like
that arm

836
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,469
obviously there are other factors
related to yawn integrating the travel

837
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:54,940
system I mentioned to you

838
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,900
looking at the HR system we've done some
interesting work around

839
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:03,239
an affinity your problems with USB
sticks

840
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,839
in some places you can make them go away
effectively

841
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,059
but in other areas it's very hard to
make them go away

842
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:13,400
but you know we've done some interesting
data related to a senate work

843
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,140
internally related to authentication
events

844
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,759
USB and certs and then looking at people
that are contractors with and number of

845
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,710
days left on their

846
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,960
on their contract and correlating that
data in real time and creating a lurks

847
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,799
around that

848
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:33,170
very interesting just just that fact

849
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,749
popping up as an alert and then matching
that with

850
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:41,380
hosts who's based technologies gives you
really interesting insight into things

851
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,400
are going on but

852
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,930
you take these other data I think if you
can imagine

853
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:49,069
using this in a risk-based
authentication model in the brain that

854
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:50,579
and that could be good

855
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,920
arm fraud is another one you know

856
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,119
I know how many view match website is
part of your job

857
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,640
you can't do like web application
firewalls tried a

858
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,119
you deal with their you know the top 20
deal with

859
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,950
your rules based approaches it's a
feeling strategies you now

860
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:12,950
arm they the way to deal with it is
probably more the whole

861
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,700
you crowd based analytics rate you that

862
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,059
1000 5000 web pages you can't have rules
for all of them

863
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:24,940
the change constantly and the attackers
will hit them

864
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,079
right after you figure out a new way to
plug the hole so

865
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,819
but if you look at at crowds of people
coming to a website in the behavior of

866
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:36,849
those clouds in the car Netflix streams
others cock others crowds

867
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,219
you can get a good sense of what good
behavior looks like

868
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:44,670
and then use analytics to look for
deviations in that type of behavior

869
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,289
and it's reasonable to look at that and
yes some ideas here

870
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:52,599
you know velocity paid sequence for
example what is a sequence in activity

871
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:53,549
based on

872
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:56,640
thousands and thousands I've click
streams

873
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,140
in terms of the velocity up the other
check out effect

874
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:05,170
or or other browsing event or something
I'll you know and when you combine that

875
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:06,410
with origin or

876
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,469
other contextual information from full
packet

877
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:14,210
you know HTTP or HTTPS if you're in the
middle of clickstream

878
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,299
yeah it becomes very very interesting on

879
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:21,119
and again you know that can also lead
you to either

880
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,529
views into other types of problems like
man the middle on

881
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:29,650
man in the browser type of type attacks

882
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,259
and your last disorder this holy grail
which some people call governance risk

883
00:54:34,259 --> 00:54:35,619
and compliance

884
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:39,940
I think today the issue there is what I
call analyst prioritisation

885
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,019
I mention to you briefly this idea how

886
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:46,799
acid intelligence on I am like the

887
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,489
anti-foreigner ability scanning guy it's
not that I don't believe in doing it

888
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:55,969
it's just that I think people do it and
rely too much on it

889
00:54:55,969 --> 00:55:00,920
on you know every week when you do it
the numbers change

890
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,029
and you you can't get it. to to fix it

891
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:07,749
you know never be fixed properly so I
don't know what the numbers mean

892
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:10,849
I mean if I showed you my numbers you
probably think I was terrible

893
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,690
my job and I know what your numbers look
like but you know they did

894
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:17,940
like this every week up and down and
sideways right

895
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,229
what I want my people to focus on his
priorities Asian

896
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:26,469
may they should be focused on the most
important assets that are under attack

897
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:28,029
right now

898
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:31,930
and get it. to deal with those in a
timely manner everything else can

899
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,940
consort await and 'it's got too much
going on at like to think we're all I

900
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,209
till this and that and

901
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:42,229
Six Sigma Black Belt buddy it doesn't
work out very well

902
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:45,979
so this is a life cycle on trying to
optimize and data

903
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:49,749
will help us optimizer life cycle

904
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:53,059
I think I've got about four minutes left
sign actually gonna shut up

905
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,979
and and try to end this little bit arm

906
00:55:56,979 --> 00:56:00,609
I know you some love you may say well I
don't know how any of this applies to my

907
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:01,380
job

908
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,809
on I will tell you that everything you
do is going to be driven by

909
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,979
big data whether you're I youjizz

910
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:13,410
he an analyst ya doing now reversing
where the responsible for an incident

911
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,809
response team with your and my job is
SSL

912
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:20,150
you've gotta think that everything's
moving in that direction

913
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,279
more data is better he really is

914
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,849
and obviously there are security
implications with big data to for

915
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,499
not only for what we do in security but
the business is going in that direction

916
00:56:30,499 --> 00:56:30,839
to

917
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,420
with what they're doing with big data
but they do believe that

918
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,670
a great opportunity for us is to not be
behind the curve

919
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:42,859
rate you know I think this you know this
site is kinda

920
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:46,599
you know my story on this and then if if
we act like we're a cure and other

921
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:47,279
trends

922
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:52,039
nighty you know there's no excuse for a

923
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,799
so you know we we need to embrace

924
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:59,619
big data we need to embrace uncertainty
and we need to find ways to

925
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:03,420
to deal with it is a part of our job and

926
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,719
you we've done some innovative things
internally I think you'll see

927
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,349
other companies that are doing this is
well I would encourage you to look into

928
00:57:10,349 --> 00:57:10,940
it

929
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,910
it does require investment requires a
commitment to architecture

930
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:20,130
it's very geeky technical data
scientists work when you first get into

931
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,769
it but it's really fine

932
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:26,029
and a you know as you can see the
vendors are all over it till

933
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:30,029
on I participate in a white paper with a
buncha people on this

934
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,969
which I'd maybe can get on our site or
just email me at now

935
00:57:33,969 --> 00:57:37,959
by and it's not a vendor stupid white
paper it's just a vendor agnostic white

936
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:38,749
paper

937
00:57:38,749 --> 00:57:43,339
but I feel free to you know paying near
download it if you want it

938
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:47,999
and I think we have about two minutes if
anybody wants to ask any questions

939
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:54,999
you

940
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,350
it looks to me that and

941
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,380
that you're trying to get ahead of the
curve you doing a good job but your

942
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,690
ask you to Division a very large company
you suffered a major breach

943
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,290
so you had things going for you to get
this arranged within your company

944
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,310
but in my organization I can never see
this happening

945
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,620
and it scares me a bit too you say dat
like

946
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:20,000
products like and trust the NetWitness
not helping you in this case

947
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,400
so you you say go out and try to find
partners but

948
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,860
hook who can do this for me who can
build me system like

949
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,180
a so

950
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,210
arm in and I could name companies

951
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:38,280
it won't but look more and more

952
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,860
I guess the way I would answer the
question is this: on

953
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,260
the managed security service providers

954
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,850
that today and I'm sorry if I offend
anyone out here

955
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:52,520
but the managed security service
providers that are out here

956
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,630
that are just doing managed firewall
NIDS

957
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,160
they're going to start feeling pressure
from olive you

958
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,110
who were saying you know the shit does
doesn't cut it right they're gonna have

959
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,750
to step up and provide more advanced
services so we see

960
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:11,400
in the US I i mean here in in in the
Netherlands we've seen service providers

961
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,660
step up and say

962
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,990
we we are going to provide these
advanced services and

963
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:20,840
and some of them are on I I was just
another country where I met a service

964
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,000
provider who's doing it this one here

965
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,870
and the Netherlands he's doing it me in
the US there's a bunch that stepped-up

966
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:30,350
it it's it's like everything else to
your point

967
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,620
I mean the larger companies for the last
two years have adopted

968
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:39,620
this approach to Big Data and it's gonna
take time for the wave to hit

969
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,790
but you know my goal is not to tell you
that a few not doing this you're behind

970
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,700
as much is

971
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,850
this is something for you to look
forward to in to move towards

972
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:54,850
overtime thank you yeah

973
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,339
I A T so I'm sure what a big companies
who approach big data analytics and

974
01:00:00,339 --> 01:00:01,579
security for the first time

975
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:05,609
they bled as they try to figure this out
he give us any warnings or any

976
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:09,140
up was to trade of putting too much
focus year which the

977
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,940
dark side a big data as we begin to
approach this

978
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,609
yeah for sure I mean on yes certainly we
bled

979
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:20,380
and I some of my peers who have done
this on their own

980
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,440
II you know because if you think about
it if you were trying to do this two

981
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,400
years ago

982
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,459
one of the problems he faces you could
go out and buy

983
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:33,660
you know for example jean-eric big data
analytic tools

984
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,049
they're out there from vendors or you
could get all the open source stuff

985
01:00:38,049 --> 01:00:42,150
bring it and make the hardware
investments necessary to do this but

986
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,650
then

987
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:45,979
you basically have a blank slate rate is
no

988
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:49,289
security in front so now you have to
figure out

989
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:52,539
all love that quote security analytics

990
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:56,109
and and that's no small task so that's
why

991
01:00:56,109 --> 01:00:59,339
that's a great point I mean so that's
why I think

992
01:00:59,339 --> 01:01:03,809
it is a balance between saying what is
your tolerance for being on that edge

993
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:04,699
today

994
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:07,849
or starting to work with vendors that

995
01:01:07,849 --> 01:01:11,329
that get in that space in it's a tricky
decision

996
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:14,559
I think the way I'd always position it
to people is

997
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,309
there's a plumbing aspect to it that

998
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:21,839
can be dealt with today to some extent
in other words there are things that

999
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,319
we're doing in the back end at this
relative to data capture

1000
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:29,130
our database management things of that
sort

1001
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,489
that are eminently fixable today
regardless of the analytic space

1002
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:37,309
the analytic space is is

1003
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:40,880
is basically nascent I think that
there's a lot happening

1004
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,089
over the next three years you can see
that explode in terms the vendor space

1005
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:45,519
but if

1006
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,489
in the analytic space it's going to be
folks such as yourself

1007
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:52,670
that you know in some cases have very
advanced skills

1008
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,880
and are comfortable with command-line
and comfortable with

1009
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,459
you know taking a system that has some
basic capabilities in and

1010
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:07,459
advancing yourself

1011
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,099
yeah I'm I think about ING we had
another

1012
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:16,969
a lot of problems this week with the
online banking

1013
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:20,849
and one of problems was that we had at
the end you must have been dedust

1014
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:24,489
and application there so am does

1015
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:28,469
does attack on on that and people were
trying to login

1016
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:31,849
am nine-g_ and that made and you stop
working

1017
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:36,739
so my question is how would you go about
fixing their and why are the banks to

1018
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:37,719
death right now

1019
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:41,890
ready so I this I can't speak to any
particular organization

1020
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:46,289
but I'll Diaz is a problem

1021
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:50,369
day organizations should be able to
address depending upon

1022
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:55,229
different aspects a you know did clearly
there are

1023
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:58,579
layer 3 and four solutions that are well
known to everybody in

1024
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:01,779
are out there there are they are seven

1025
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:06,219
solution providers that have become very
very good at dealing with this

1026
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:09,309
when we're talking specifically about

1027
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:12,640
the iranian attacks like the other bill
to

1028
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,789
3 type attacks that's an interesting
animal because

1029
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:20,499
are the adaptive nature them and some
other

1030
01:03:20,499 --> 01:03:24,229
service providers shall mention hear
about the guy

1031
01:03:24,229 --> 01:03:27,709
talk about you on private have struggled
obey

1032
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:31,670
to adapt to some of those attacks

1033
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,839
I think I'll what's interesting there is

1034
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:39,579
that arm you have to look beyond

1035
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:45,529
the classic dedust provider for some of
these were advanced e das attacks to

1036
01:03:45,529 --> 01:03:48,999
either there are some providers that are
now looking at

1037
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:54,089
behavioral based modeling I love I've
that environment

1038
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:57,410
as an alternative to classic detox

1039
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:01,549
protection and that's something I would
consider

1040
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:05,459
in other words not just treated as a
network device based on analyzing

1041
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:06,630
NetFlow

1042
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,130
datagrams at layer 7 to do that
protection which is how

1043
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,319
one of the major providers does it today

1044
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:18,609
and arguably has done it fairly well
except for these recent attacks

1045
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:22,170
by there is another approach which is
more based on

1046
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:27,420
deep packet inspection and layer 7
behavioral analysis

1047
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,809
I think that's a good alternative
approach for this type of thing I've

1048
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:32,199
always thought that that

1049
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:35,779
plus threat intelligence would be a
really good approach for

1050
01:04:35,779 --> 01:04:40,289
for the dust protection there's a player
that's doing that right now

1051
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:43,920
I think that I can say that ninety
vendor names

1052
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,670
thank you very much Eddie will now break
for

1053
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:51,549
coffee break so please join me in
thanking Eddie for lodging

1054
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:52,239
this year's conference
