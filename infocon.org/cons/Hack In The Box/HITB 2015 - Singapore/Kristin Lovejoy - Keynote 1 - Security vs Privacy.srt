1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:19,810
and I just took my head just kept
hurting and so I kept taking aspirin all

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,240
day like every four hours to aspirin and
I started hallucinating I don't know

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,140
what I just had no idea what was going
on my husband came in to see me

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,980
couple days later I said honey I think
I'm dying and he looked at the bottle

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:41,099
that I was taking any said honey that's
ambien and got into the hotel

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,350
actually kinda did the same thing if I
fall off the stage or do something

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,870
really dumb it's my fault I did about
1:30 and I'm still a little bit high so

8
00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:06,320
let me introduce myself I guess the
grandmother of security I started in

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,690
this field about twenty-five years ago
when I think about how long ago that was

10
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,979
my god I was actually a network engineer
and I was cramping lines and actually

11
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,460
one of the intelligence agencies in the
us- and at the time this intelligence

12
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,350
see you know how smart this this
particular organization was they were

13
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:32,059
implementing Microsoft proxy server as
their firewall solution and they don't

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,500
know how to do it so I asked me if I
could do it like a fine whatever I can

15
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,430
configure the router I can put this in
and lo and behold I became a security

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,869
expert so I did that for a little bit
and ended up going to start out and I

17
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,180
was an ethical hacker so I was going to
you guys for several years consulting

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,210
started a company sold the company to
IBM had lots of interesting roles at IBM

19
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:02,110
one of which was chief security officer
which I did for several years and most

20
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:09,560
recently left IBM's as of a few months
ago to join a company called acuity but

21
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm really not going to talk about very
much a little bit of the end but that's

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,330
more within the context of machines

23
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:28,370
ring I I am a pragmatist and so people
set kind of cynical cynical just sexual

24
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,110
experience and so as I'm speaking to you
today we're gonna be speaking about its

25
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,410
privacy and security and the challenges
that interpreting the requirements of

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,440
both have brought to us we're gonna be
talking about some pretty dicey stuff

27
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm going to be asking you some
questions were gonna do some audience

28
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,359
participation is part of this but my
goal today is to be representative of

29
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,880
what one of your bosses looks like I
mean I'm

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,230
I am A C so by trade I am the person
that is making the decisions and so I

31
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,299
want you to understand how I think and
how I think about the topics of privacy

32
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:17,600
and security how I way and prioritize
what I do why I do it how I do it how

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,410
much I spend on it as well as to tell
you about some of the things that I and

34
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,590
others in my field reso's in my field
are really thinking about investing in

35
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,000
today

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,550
alright so with that let's talk about
privacy now a better definition of peer

37
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,530
I can tell you that throughout my career
I could sit in rooms hundred times

38
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,950
bigger than this one and if I were to
put a gun against everybody's head not

39
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,000
one of them would be able to give me a
good definition of what privacy yes I

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,230
look at this you know privacy is a
fundamental human right what does that

41
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:03,290
actually mean I mean seriously how do
you create regulation around that how do

42
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,239
you interpret from a security
perspective what that means why are we

43
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,540
talking about it so much in many Western
nations in many countries in Asia in

44
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,418
some countries in South America we think
about privacy the reality is with

45
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:27,990
privacy tho privacy is really messy
subject

46
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:36,289
no one definition universal definition
of privacy that anyone adheres to do you

47
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:42,330
know that in you s it is not
constitutional right in India it is not

48
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:48,710
a constitutional right in Ireland
privacy the fundamental right to protect

49
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:56,659
one's liberty is not constitutional
right every country for the most part

50
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,199
has different definitions of what it
means even in the us- in the us- we have

51
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,919
fifty states 49 states have some form of
privacy legislation all which define

52
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:19,090
privacy in different ways we have 49
regulations defining what is privacy

53
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,409
that's in scene now when you look at
privacy within the context of the

54
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:28,740
Millennial Generation you guys sitting
in this room

55
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,479
it means something completely different
and my job as a C so going back to the

56
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,199
pragmatic part of me is to understand
what it means because you know what you

57
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,889
guys now represent the bulk of my work
force when I'm hiring I'm hiring

58
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:52,400
somebody in your age bracket 18 to 35
years old and I've gotta think about how

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,400
you work how you consider information
how you manipulate that information

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,318
because I am NOT going to be successful
if I don't take that into account so

61
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:09,080
when I think about security when I think
about privacy and I think about the mess

62
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,650
that those two things create a little
bit of a headache so let me ask you a

63
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,150
quick question quick vote this is true
statistic based on something the Direct

64
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,679
Marketing Association asked and I
typically don't dump lot of credence in

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,969
these kinds of statistics but this one I
actually think is pretty true based on

66
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,930
the control group that they assessed how
many what percentage of Millennials

67
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,020
would give away their personal
information for a better on

68
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,780
online shopping experience how many of
you would vote 11 how many of you would

69
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,909
vote to how many of you would vote three

70
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,949
answer is actually one and every other
SAT this is the lowest that I could find

71
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,659
most other stats will share it show it
up at about 86% do you know what that

72
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:08,550
drops to people my age bracket drop down
to like less than 5% there is a huge

73
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,409
generational gap when it comes to what
it means to maintain personal

74
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:14,340
information

75
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,940
let's talk about what is personal
information and what what is privacy you

76
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,919
know particularly among again

77
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,680
Millennial Generation this is the future
of the workplace

78
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,000
this is the future of my customer base
I've gotta think about how you work and

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,610
why you work in order for me to do a
good job so when I think about privacy

80
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,169
today what is privacy up a fundamental
right that's great and have you believe

81
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:51,250
it is a fundamental right interesting to
know whether you're so bored out of your

82
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,729
mind you're not raising your hands or
you actually don't know how many of you

83
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:04,449
are unsure of what it means anybody want
to proffer an opinion as to an

84
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,860
alternative no alright let's let me tell
you what I think it means in today's day

85
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:18,219
and age what is privacy I have a wife or
kids one of which actually taught me

86
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:25,190
what privacy bus she is to tell you how
old she is now but anyway we were

87
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,250
talking one day and she said to me I've
got this really big problem but no money

88
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,880
that's your grandmother she friended me
on Facebook and I said I don't know what

89
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,660
to do if I say yes she's gonna see what
I'm doing on the weekends and she's

90
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,689
gonna be really mad and if I say no I'm
gonna hurt her feelings

91
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,660
so that's what to tell you go do what
you think is right and you could talk to

92
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,689
you know if you're going to say no I'm
not telling her she said ok well let me

93
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,660
think about it came back and she said
you know what I figured it out what did

94
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,760
you decide to do she said I friended her
but what I found is that in facebook I'm

95
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,650
able to control the choices of what kind
of data she can stay so I can restrict

96
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:24,699
her profile and I said that's that's
privacy privacy today if you go back to

97
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,000
fundamental right

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,730
privacy is an individual right so
privacy is my individual right

99
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,880
individual right to control our data
when we provided to a third party

100
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,660
organization and all and I'll give you
in a nutshell what that means because

101
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,310
I've done abroad assessment of privacy
regulations and I've tried to distill

102
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,089
the requirements down so that you can
see exactly what it means and where

103
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:01,700
security fits but suffice to say I
believe I believe that privacy is an

104
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,960
individual right that I can control my
information once I've given it to a

105
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,780
third party and most Millennials share
that seemed opinion now when it comes to

106
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,600
the countries which are responsible for
understanding the way people think and

107
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,950
then defining the regulations in and
around privacy what you find is there

108
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:33,480
are three basic categories of regulation
I've highlighted the number one most

109
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,310
prevalent form of regulation 1 privacy
reg is to help you promote electronic

110
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,400
commerce what many countries have found
is that consumers don't like giving away

111
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,020
information unless they feel somewhat
protected so privacy regulations really

112
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,110
have nothing to do with the human right
it has everything to do with the

113
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,850
economics second category is the
pan-european laws

114
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,560
now europe has always been because of
its history of World War Two has has

115
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,560
historically led the arena when it comes
to privacy regulations the EU has

116
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,719
defined with the exception of Ireland
which there's a little bit of an irony

117
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,050
there by the way but with the exception
of irony of Ireland all of the EU

118
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,899
nations have instantiated by
constitution that privacy is a

119
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,949
fundamental human right and in some
jurisdictions they've gone so far as to

120
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,258
say people can have anonymity and
privacy and anonymity they could be

121
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,250
wiped clean off the slate they don't
have to exist and then third is to

122
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,220
remedy past injuries this is where
there's been human trafficking sex

123
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,769
slavery all those kinds of things you'll
see you a bunch of regulations why is it

124
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:51,060
all

125
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,079
why is it important why am i explaining
this to you I'm explaining this to you

126
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,279
because as a practitioner I have to
understand this because if I'm working

127
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,600
at a company like IBM that does business
in a hundred eighty five countries guess

128
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,220
what I have to understand what the laws
are in a hundred eighty five countries

129
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,110
so that I can implement effective
security controls in order to enforce

130
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,939
the privacy rights but not get into
illegal jam so it's important to

131
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:31,000
understand the why and the how and so if
you look at the world in general this is

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,939
just put this up very briefly this kind
of highlights where there are privacy

133
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:43,910
regulations so Cu s in Argentina in I'm
sorry in Brazil in russia you have

134
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,189
minimal restrictions on privacy places
like Europe you have very very strong

135
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:55,060
restrictions vis-a-vis privacy in many
of the Asian nations you have there's

136
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,790
just emptiness right now you've got some
growing focus on privacy regulation but

137
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,459
by by and large it's a tapestry and then
within each of these countries you

138
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:12,498
further drill down and there are lots
and lots and lots of regs so privacy

139
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:17,669
right of an individual control your
personal information and ensure that its

140
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,489
not disclosed

141
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:23,539
used or modified by a third party
without your permission now this is

142
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:27,189
important because this is where security
comes in so now let's talk about

143
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:35,368
security ever wanted to teach a class on
what privacy actually means youre gonna

144
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:40,649
have right of privacy regulation a
privacy regulation I was believed in you

145
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,179
take all the regulations you put them in
a big box shake real hard to see what

146
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,789
comes out the bottom if I look at all of
the privacy regulations out there today

147
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:54,079
I shook real hard these are the things
that would come out and what privacy

148
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,258
regulation essentially says is I have to
within an organization

149
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,789
define who owns the data ok that makes
sense I've got to identify and document

150
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,629
why it's being collected and used I've
gotta make sure that the end user can

151
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:16,519
consent to me collecting it I've got to
make sure that only collecting that

152
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,739
which I absolutely need for business
purposes I need to make sure I'm

153
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:27,519
limiting how it's being used within the
organization I need to ensure that it's

154
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,309
accurate if I've got medical information
for instance I have to make sure that

155
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,909
it's not being changed erroneously I
have to implement the safeguards guess

156
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:47,099
what guys security implementing
safeguard its shoring that I have dealt

157
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,539
with the confidentiality of that data
the integrity of the data and the

158
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:57,419
availability of the data that's my
obligation I ensure only the people that

159
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,789
need to have it have access to it that's
not being changed and it's always

160
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:06,909
available that is my job as a security
practitioner and then finally I have to

161
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:10,849
create a culture of openness of people
know that if it if there is a breach

162
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:15,369
they can talk about it and that there's
recourse if an end user has a complete

163
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:19,809
her problem they have a way of getting
to me that is a privacy regulations have

164
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:25,529
you ever wondered what the chief privacy
officer does and how it's different from

165
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:31,409
security Privacy Officer is responsible
for all that stuff

166
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:38,769
security is only responsible for that
one block and security is responsible

167
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:44,189
for assisting in the other areas
particularly when it comes to the areas

168
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:58,469
of identification and documentation that
is securities role within privacy I

169
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,499
thought this was pretty funny because I
think it talks a lot about the problem

170
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:08,470
with security now the problem with
security is that as we implement the

171
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,179
controls to ensure confidentiality
availability and integrity oftentimes

172
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:21,339
the controls that we implement create
challenges there are certain areas like

173
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:28,149
monitoring like encryption decryption
technologies even role-based access

174
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:34,439
controls biometrics that run afoul of
certain privacy restrictions did you

175
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:38,379
know that in places like Finland and IP
addresses personally identifiable

176
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:44,699
information can collect that so you have
to make sure as you're implementing

177
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:50,529
those security controls you understand
the privacy landscape because oftentimes

178
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,349
the controls you implement may create
challenges and we will talk about that

179
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:59,619
in just a sec so here is the little
another piece of Education this very

180
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:07,139
educational speech by the way I just
want to give you a bit of a primer on

181
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:14,168
how people like me think about security
nowadays and the role of security in my

182
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:21,089
world security plays a part in for risk
areas now it's important to understand

183
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:28,000
about a risk officer is that our
security risk manager or see so is that

184
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,270
at the end of the day our responsibility
is to be guardian

185
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,490
of companies funds and to ensure that
we're investing in the right places that

186
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:44,750
are going to reduce the most risk now
from my perspective there are four basic

187
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:52,900
categories of risk and this is very
common across most enterprises there is

188
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:00,410
the risk of some sort of disruption or
significant business outage caused by

189
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:08,210
advanced threats nation states terrorist
groups activists etcetera the buzz words

190
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,430
you're gonna hear cyberwar you're gonna
hear hacktivism and this is all about

191
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:19,130
ensuring the infrastructure ensuring the
longevity of the business will talk

192
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,910
about why this is keeping me up in a
little bit I'll give you some practical

193
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,900
examples of some use cases but this is
the hot one this is the one we're all

194
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,700
gonna be talking about over the next few
years

195
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,680
cyber-espionage this is stealing data
even create something like black market

196
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,080
products cybercrime stealing identities
stealing data for any money for money

197
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,570
laundering fraud opening up the US bank
accounts all that kind of stuff and then

198
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:52,649
finally privacy if you look down at the
bottom I T security legal officer

199
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,920
financial crime unit chief privacy
officer what you find is they're

200
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,050
different owners within the company that
owned these categories of concern

201
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:07,190
security really owns the cyberwar unrest

202
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,290
peace now I put I T security down there
because the sea SOLAS haven't

203
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:16,629
necessarily woken up to this is a
problem yet you guys get it we don't

204
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:23,290
really get it what we do own cyber
espionage your crown jewels everybody

205
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,500
cares about crown jewels crown jewels
what his crown jewels Crown Jewels is

206
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,720
the stuff that company has retained a
perspective that we actually care about

207
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,110
if we lost it it would have a big impact
on the business I care about this now

208
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,939
why because the SEC says I have to care
what I care otherwise I don't

209
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,029
cybercrime guess what

210
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:53,340
that's not my bailiwick identity theft
fraud I don't own that the Financial

211
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,959
Crimes Unit on that different group I
implement controls but I'm reactive I

212
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,039
don't drive the strategy privacy that's
owned by the Chief Privacy Officer no

213
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,950
I'm pointing this out because if you
ever wonder why things are fragmented

214
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,950
why you were approaching things as if
it's a firestorm you know you've got

215
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,740
your plan you got your strategy you're
going down a certain way and then all of

216
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,710
a sudden somebody comes in from the
wings and says no you gotta do it that

217
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:28,559
way why there's this big map that the
CEO has an on that map they've got for

218
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,658
blogs rewards that crispy and I
cybercrime privacy and you rack and

219
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:38,789
stack them and you say which one is the
most important to my business and that's

220
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,250
the one you focus on and so if one of
these goes to the tap it means all of my

221
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,769
focus goes into that area that's what we
are at the beck and call of the overall

222
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:56,700
risk organization who makes that
definition so from a practical

223
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,470
perspective what do businesses worry
about I think this is a good one this is

224
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,120
a good graphic I like the stats from
heckman gettin personally and they have

225
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,168
they do it on a month-to-month basis I
couldn't find the 2015 roll up but it

226
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,210
was pretty similar

227
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,529
you know cyber crime is the number one
issue identity theft money laundering

228
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:25,149
it's all about the money has nothing to
do with privacy it has to do with the

229
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:29,439
money that's the number one thing I
worry about number two thing I worry

230
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,649
about its hacktivism now I think that
this is a bit of an irony because

231
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:43,139
activists so this is really interesting
and problematic with your age group is

232
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:48,500
you know if you actually do a study of
who are the activists there's really two

233
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,690
basic groups of folks one are those who
believe that you know denial of service

234
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,330
attacks are inappropriate for

235
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,559
of civil disobedience it's like a sit-in
and it has some academic studies have

236
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,809
been done they found that a huge
proportion of college students believe

237
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,418
that this is totally acceptable so if
you ever look at if you go to a telecom

238
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,470
and if you work at a Telkom now if
you've ever watched the staff's if you

239
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,590
sitting in a Telkom now fuck and you're
watching the stats Araki security

240
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,340
incidents what you find is Friday at
five o'clock is inevitably where the

241
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,240
when the denial of service attack start
and why is that

242
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,990
grabbing a beer in the dorm you started
denial of service check with that's half

243
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,600
that group the other half the group is
terrorist cells that are fronting social

244
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,969
activist groups I'm sure you guys have
seen this in your own forensic

245
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,179
investigation but when we do our
forensic analysis what we tend to find

246
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:53,380
is it's a good way of enrolling
unsuspecting people into cyber crime is

247
00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:00,090
by creating up front next group its
cyber espionage that is increasing and

248
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,080
then finally cyberwar cyberwar is the
fastest growing category and I'll

249
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,240
explain why I think that is a little bit
but this is the area we have to be

250
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,840
really worried about used to be that
less than a fraction of a percent of all

251
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,189
security incidents that we frantically
examined could be tied back to cyber war

252
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:29,620
now it's getting to be almost 8% over
the course of two years it's a big deal

253
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,229
alright so let's talk about the reality
now when I sit down with my board I

254
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,059
don't have my head in the sand I don't
pretend that nothing happened he said

255
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,928
stats that we picked up from IBM last
year so I believe these fats because I

256
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:51,840
actually put them together what we were
seeing is that an average enterprise in

257
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,199
an enterprise's of about 10,000 seats an
organization that 10,000 people what

258
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,260
you'll see is your systems Europe and
event management systems for monitoring

259
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,450
systems will pick up about 1.7 million
events

260
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,370
now those 1.7 million events three
hundred and twenty four of those events

261
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:18,000
religion attacks this is somebody or
something was trying to get in and then

262
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,900
all of these what we were seeing is 2.1
of those each week would get into the

263
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,830
institution and caused some sort of
impact know what impact didn't have to

264
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,600
be you know took down the entire
organization or led to huge breach it

265
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,899
really means that there is the incident
so somebody within the organization had

266
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,330
to react to do something the way I would
always use these statistics when I talk

267
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:52,149
to a board is fake we're all infected so
if you think about security you can't

268
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,400
think about it within that defense in
depth model that we used to think about

269
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,390
like putting a you know a moat around
the castle sorry but that's a bunch of

270
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:08,080
crap this is a biological model we've
all got viruses we've got bacteria and

271
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,810
the reality is the job of a see so is no
longer to try to keep yourself in a

272
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:19,260
plastic bubble the reality is we've got
to be able to differentiate between a

273
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,980
common cold and the bowl of virus that's
our job so we have to understand of

274
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:33,710
those 2.1 incidents per week which one
of those is noteworthy so that I can

275
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,320
react to that noteworthy means it can
have a material or significant impact on

276
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,700
the business now what does that mean
means that there's a significant

277
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,340
financial issue that has to go to the
board now when it comes to who is being

278
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:56,040
attacked finance insurance number one
this number two is the big deal and the

279
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,340
big news

280
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,280
manufacturing so you're seeing that
increased from a cyberwar perspective

281
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,070
that goes hand in hand we're seeing a
lot more focused cyber-espionage so

282
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,560
focusing on finding strategic plans
etcetera

283
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,419
as well as systems disruption going
after I O T you know how they are going

284
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,650
after IOT they're going after the human
management system

285
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,220
items so the control systems that manage
the SCADA network the skate environments

286
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,930
those are usually sitting on the network
on the internet y so the guy sitting in

287
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,540
the operator booze of citizen don't know
how many times we can watch movies when

288
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,659
it's the middle of the night so they're
all accessible but these are the top to

289
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:45,130
finance manufacturing information retail
health and social services that all

290
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:53,730
makes total sense now let let's talk
about those 2.1 incidents what those two

291
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,070
point one incident don't include are the

292
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:05,860
I lost my laptop I did something really
dumb like sent out a customer lists to

293
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,620
something I shouldn't have I didn't
report my laptop or my smartphone being

294
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:18,429
stolen for each one of the events the
attacks that you see that are generated

295
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,910
by somebody with malicious intent

296
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:27,940
there's another 99 of them or so that
our material so when it comes to the

297
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,770
what happened the malicious intent how
did they get in malware infection

298
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,010
explain like that my statistics what
what people did to allow them to get in

299
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,760
so you're owed a malware access misuse
somebody used the same password that

300
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,830
they used to buy shoes to administer a
system where a website compromise that

301
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:57,689
the mean way to they're getting in now
when you look at the who is perpetrating

302
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:06,540
harm when we did our analysis what we
found is worldwide stats different

303
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:12,430
patterns in different countries most of
the attacks were being the malicious

304
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:19,550
attacks going back to those 2.1 those
being over being handled by outsiders 10

305
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,230
years ago this is very different would
inflict between insiders and outsiders

306
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:28,320
but we've seen a decrease in the number
of security of them

307
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,820
associated with insiders personally I
think it's because we've gotten better

308
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,049
at controlling those kinds of those
individuals within our organizations but

309
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,480
this could always change and then what's
really interesting its combination we

310
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,330
see a lot of and you are system admins
and people within the manufacturing

311
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:54,220
organizations working in collusion with
organized crime this particularly

312
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,740
happens in South America you see it
during the holidays and organized crime

313
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:06,220
cartel get in touch with you and say hey
I'll pay you $1500 all I need is your

314
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,360
username and your password for a week so
while you're on holiday Christmas I mean

315
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,959
you're not even be working let me just
use your username and password and then

316
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,399
when you come back you can change it

317
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,389
half now half when you get back we're
seeing a lot of that happen so this is

318
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:27,758
an interesting one that bears paying
attention to also seeing a lot of it the

319
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,539
call centres I don't know if any of you
are seeing a lot of more incidents and

320
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:37,240
call centers but you know these are
lower paid people came some money over

321
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,220
the holidays and it's a bonanza of
usernames and passwords now what is

322
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,830
interesting to me though is if you look
at all of these incidents and you were

323
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:55,610
to do the forensic investigation
ninety-five percent plus the reason the

324
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:01,658
bad guy Guardian was because there was
some dumb human who did something really

325
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:07,769
dumb to let them in a human error was a
contributing factor so what did we see

326
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:14,850
what I see ten the top reasons why the
bad guys got in

327
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,490
well you know end users will double
click on anything they just can't help

328
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,039
themselves they will disable security
settings because they're a pain in the

329
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,840
behind values legacy software they won't
catch it they will use your default

330
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,020
password or use the same passwords that
they use for business for personal use

331
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:42,430
again and then as far as the sysadmin
for developers I love this one they

332
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,450
built within a cloud environment they
stick up the image they do testing you

333
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,600
know in a cloud environment and then it
works really well then they put a right

334
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,149
into production without realizing we
needed a firewall in front of it before

335
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,020
you put it in production during the
testing process don't remove default

336
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,320
accounts don't patch is like a sea
software that's really not privileged

337
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,450
user sports or end user's fault a lot of
its corporate just being cheap not

338
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,510
giving you upgraded stuff and then using
in secure remote management software

339
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:22,660
those are the big ones that the why the
bad guys got in KY is easy I'm not gonna

340
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,480
solve your intelligence we all know
because the carding forums etc what I

341
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,740
always think is really interesting is
that here in I'm going to introduce to

342
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:43,130
you my theory as to why we should all be
terrified about what's going to happen

343
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:52,940
over the next few years we all get that
sucks security incidents are driven by

344
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,180
those individuals that are just trying
to make money a lot of it is just

345
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:07,400
financially motivated anybody disagree
with that its business so let's let's

346
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,700
talk about this business

347
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:15,960
how did it happen well if you look at
the rise of cybercrime really

348
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,030
interesting I am very analytical I like
to understand the why because I believe

349
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:25,149
you can't fix it unless you understand
the why something's happening or why it

350
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:31,020
works that way and you know what I
looked at is and I found this one UN

351
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,360
study and it was the office of drugs

352
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,399
and something the other day did the
study on Cyber Crime Statistics and what

353
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:48,330
they looked at is the correlation
between the growth of internet access in

354
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:55,990
nations where there is good basic
education very low blow

355
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:02,880
opportunity so high unemployment low
economic opportunity for the 17th of 35

356
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,530
year olds and what you see is there is a
direct correlation between internet

357
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:17,530
growth and cybercrime and so the way it
works is people within these nations and

358
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:24,090
I'll give you examples Eastern Europe
Nigeria places where most of the crime

359
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,290
is emanating from today you look at it

360
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,860
these nations were economically stagnant
lots of very highly educated people with

361
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,919
internet access

362
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,140
whatcha gonna do to get out of out of it
financial jam well you know a lot of it

363
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:45,030
was opportunistic starts opportunistic
and then over time it becomes much more

364
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:50,389
organized and so now the you know the
organizations that are you know

365
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,980
perpetrating harm you know those that
are writing the malware creating them

366
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,140
our kids etc these are businesses if you
were to interview these folks that I

367
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,770
think they're doing anything wrong
they're working for a business it just

368
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,100
so happens they're building tools with
which you can create your Gmail where

369
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,310
you don't care what it's used for sure
you guys have heard all the stories

370
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,330
about crypto locker all the you know the
fact that those who were you know

371
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,620
provide the crypt a locker out will you
know have customer service groups that

372
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,690
are i mean great customer service so I
think you know there is a direct

373
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,830
correlation at least I'd seen and you
know the UN studies will back me up on

374
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,679
this there is a correlation between
internet penetration in these kinds of

375
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,779
countries and Internet crime now what's
going to happen

376
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:48,140
this is the part where do you think a
lot of the internet growth is going to

377
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,400
happen over the next few years

378
00:34:51,400 --> 00:35:00,770
ideas but let's put it this way the
Middle East has virtually no internet

379
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,920
access to even Iran where you'll see on
paper there's forty percent internet

380
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,440
access that's not true

381
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,500
less than 4% it's very controlled
environment so we have places like

382
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:20,780
sitting on Yemen Afghanistan Iran Iraq
cetera no I'm not saying I'm not trying

383
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,000
to point out that you know they're the
people that are living in these regions

384
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,200
are terrorists not what I'm saying at
all the fact is though that as you see

385
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,660
internet growth what you see is people
organized and what we've seen is there

386
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,609
has been a growth in disruptive attacks
coming out of the middle east as

387
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,020
Internet penetration has increased in
these nations so if you talk about all

388
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:54,640
of a sudden giving ten to twenty million
people within the age group of 10 of 17

389
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:03,620
to 35 internet access what do you
think's gonna happen a lot of them are

390
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,839
not they're not building you know the
technologies are used for cybercrime

391
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,930
their building technology is there a lot
of the businesses are being built around

392
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,450
systems disruption when I look at the
world the thing that keeps me up at

393
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,210
night

394
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:25,600
IOT I mean look at the IRT this stuff

395
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,279
respond I responded to an incident once
and this one really woke me up

396
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,570
captain couple years ago healthcare
institutions I can't say which one for

397
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:42,210
obvious reasons health care institution
their hospital and they were expanding

398
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,590
coverage they've servicing rural areas
the United States and what they were

399
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:54,290
doing is expanding physician coverage by
doing things like putting in kiosks so

400
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,750
you could talk to your doctor in the
pharmacy or in the supermarket they were

401
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:04,000
sending out radiology machines into
pharmacies they were doing things like

402
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,360
sending dialysis machines into the
homesteading so instead of having to

403
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,750
drive to a hospital that was two hours
away you could have dialysis which is

404
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,110
cleaning of your kidneys you could do
that at home

405
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,020
well in this particular instance in this
happens in most hospitals anybody work

406
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,380
in a hospital now ok well what happens
is when you go into hospital all been to

407
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,170
a hospital in short when you go to you
see the nurses station

408
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:35,940
well guess what they're at the nurses
station

409
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,610
the device the HMI system the system
that is used to manage things like

410
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:49,050
dialysis machines is at the nurses desk
oftentimes those things are logged off

411
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,720
then logged on and in this particular
case what you had as a disgruntled

412
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,419
employee this was an orderly not a nurse
but an orderly was mad and decided to

413
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,780
shut off all the dialysis machine so we
went into the interface which was not

414
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,760
use that password protected and he
basically shutting down rebooted them

415
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,590
and when you reboot them like many IOT
devices when you reboot an IOT device it

416
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,300
comes up with the default password
because it's a fail-safe mechanism

417
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,400
particularly health devices because it
helped in a home setting if you're about

418
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,250
ready to die because we're dialysis
machine isn't working you want somebody

419
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,940
like your wife come in and reset it for
you you don't want complex passwords

420
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,600
reset with the default this is typical

421
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,540
so when I think about my OT and I think
about the kinds of activities that we're

422
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,680
seeing in the growth destructive
activities one of the reasons why I

423
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,149
wanted to be here today is because I do
think you have such an important role in

424
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,860
helping us to understand this kind of
destructive malware in particular which

425
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:05,460
i think is gonna be the the real thing
that we need to worry about so what are

426
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,230
the things that I'm worrying about what
are the things that I am investing in

427
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:15,200
some of this gonna give you a few brief
tidbits about my investment objectives

428
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,520
so there's two areas that are going to
talk about but i wanna just highlight

429
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,830
some of the other areas in general

430
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,759
number one area that were a lot of us
are focusing on today's training

431
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,190
employees and you guys might think it's
really dumb let me tell you going back

432
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:40,610
to a biological model this is not about
eradicated the risk it's about reducing

433
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:50,540
it statistically training employees does
have a positive effect in decreasing the

434
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:55,840
rate of incidents because you're
training your end users to double-click

435
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,770
less frequently I'm not saying it's
perfect

436
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:04,780
the best you can ever hope for is to
have about 60 percent of your employee

437
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,460
base not do something really stupid
that's the best you can ever hope for

438
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,410
but it's better than 80% and so that's
what it's all about it's about

439
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,589
statistical reduction incident rate you
want to bring down your malware

440
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:24,310
infection rate now training without
testing does not work so you have to do

441
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,810
social engineering you have to do
fishing tests all that kind of stuff I'm

442
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,160
gonna skip over number two number five
for the time being because I want to go

443
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:40,799
into these in a little bit more deaths
adapt cloud adopt mobile adopt social I

444
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,470
have seen again going back to two
toothpick sampling the more radically

445
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,799
adopt these kinds of

446
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,160
acknowledged he is the better your
overall security posture is gonna be for

447
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,420
a couple of reasons one is because your
employees like water will find a way

448
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,240
around the rules and if you don't let
them have access to mobile and social

449
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,569
and particular they're going to do it
anyway so it is better to give them

450
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:14,540
controlled environments to a lot of my
investments are in bring your own device

451
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,160
which by the way to typically you see a
lot less security incidents and bring

452
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,140
your own device when you see on our
corporate vice I think it's because

453
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,830
people care about their devices more
number one and because number two is

454
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,110
oftentimes were using virtualization and
because you can stop the container

455
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:39,920
you're not getting as much lateral
penetration cloud what why am i staying

456
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,970
adopt cloud I think you cloud is really
absolutely fascinating how it has

457
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:51,020
changed US where the cloud come from
cloud is very simple

458
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,540
from an economic perspective I wanted as
a business owner I wanted to go get a

459
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,120
and e-commerce applications for new
website stood up the way I would do it

460
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,589
ten years ago I would go to my chief
financial officer and I'd say can you

461
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:12,280
put in this capex request here my
requirements document to the CIO who

462
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,860
work with me will build this application
ladi Dadi would take a year now with

463
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,590
cloud while I take my credit card ten
minutes later I have an environment

464
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:30,330
which I can build now that is leading to
number two the requirement to move into

465
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,650
a were reorganised security to deal with
paddle DevOps but I'll talk about that

466
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,300
in just a second but the reason why I'm
a big believer in cloud is because clubs

467
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:44,730
like a mean frank you can create a
pattern of security pattern that is

468
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,030
replicable she can create that pattern
and then you can replicated out to your

469
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,730
cloud images and if you're really good
you can actually delete and reuse images

470
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:59,140
which is really cool because if you're
worried at all about your day malware

471
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,129
infection you get rid of it

472
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:09,269
you pull up the golden image and you
restore the image great number for mind

473
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:14,910
the supply chain this is really a
Compliance Statement most regulatory

474
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,930
authorities today are telling businesses
to worry about your third party partners

475
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:24,368
because they are the source of a lot of
your infections and I wanna go back to

476
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:27,819
number two and number five

477
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:32,700
don't be surprised guys security is
changing from an organizational

478
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:41,960
perspective remember like that cloud is
economic sort of result well what is

479
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:48,930
cloud allowing cloud is introducing now
Agilent DevOps because now I have the

480
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,779
infrastructure available to me what I
can do is I can build more quickly how

481
00:43:54,779 --> 00:44:07,420
many of your organizations have adopted
a waterfall ok well it's happening you

482
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,069
probably don't know what's happening yet
but most organizations are if they have

483
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:15,259
an actively adopted it they've got a
skunk works project where they're

484
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:20,269
adopting agile right now what is actual
a jewel is development on steroids it

485
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:29,430
just happens really quickly now what
i've seen in a draw is that because the

486
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:33,788
way security is built to securities very
policy oriented we write a policy we

487
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:37,549
write a configuration document we assume
people are going to follow it doesn't

488
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:42,720
work in a natural world so because it
doesn't work in an Advil world we

489
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,078
security have to change what we do so a
lot of security organizations are being

490
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,170
dismantled today and they're being
radically changed so that the security

491
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:03,140
organization goes from an organization
which was policy and response to an

492
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,910
organization which is much more engaged
and active providing consultation

493
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,299
services and testing services good news
for you guys

494
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:20,930
you will be employed for a really long
time because what I did back in IBM and

495
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,950
this is what I advise a lot of boards
and organizations on today is that the

496
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:33,330
organization needs to change such that
you've got a very very very small group

497
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,920
at top the kind of understands you know
sort of the overall architecture of the

498
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:47,070
organization but most of the people that
you've got coaching advising and frankly

499
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:53,210
testing so what we would do or what I
would do an IBM is I took all of my

500
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:00,510
people and I would put them into the
advil teams into the development teams

501
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,990
they lived with them they worked with
them they went through the whole process

502
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,529
with them I have usually had one
architect and I had a tester and I made

503
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:15,710
available a core set of tools think
about it almost like a cyber range a set

504
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:20,140
of tools that each of those individuals
can use within those teams but what I

505
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,430
would do is as part of the minimal
viable product as part of the actual

506
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:31,009
process there was a requirement that
security needed to be built into the

507
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:36,060
software code and see what we would do
is a short that the individuals who are

508
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,330
the advisers were doing the testing
shoring the minimum viable product then

509
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,980
it was ready for production but that was
the concept many organizations are

510
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:54,880
changing into this model that typical
centralized policy you know some

511
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:03,340
response is going away that's not to say
that you're not gonna stop so let's talk

512
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:11,780
about the south side many of you have
any regard to an incident response from

513
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:18,460
organizational perspective lots of money
is going into this area and I personally

514
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,070
think this is why I actually left IBM

515
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:28,190
is there there are some areas there are
some technology here that are on equally

516
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,300
cool that are coming out so let me go
through what the sock looks like today

517
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,630
this is the more of the high-level
architectural view of what is security

518
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,070
operations center platform looks like on
top of this you're gonna have people

519
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:49,500
people operating via some sort of
analyst roles that so what happens is at

520
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,260
the bottom

521
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,160
you've got all of your you know sort of
act your active defense and offense

522
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,529
defense capabilities I gotta love that
term active defense so you've got all of

523
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:04,090
these capabilities you've got your
monitoring technologies you've got your

524
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,520
traditional network defense technologies
you got your host base defense

525
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,370
technologies you've got your
vulnerability scanners and other kinds

526
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:16,049
of assessment capabilities hopefully in
an integrated platform not always all of

527
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,680
the events coming from these
technologies are going into a data

528
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,480
warehouse that's shooting from a data
warehouse into an event management or

529
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,510
some sort of analytics engine like a
Splunk and on top of that you've got an

530
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:33,220
analyst workbench the cyber range if you
will with lots and lots of different

531
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,709
types of tools that are being integrated
in that platform that people from the

532
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:43,330
incident response team and others either
the hunter team or the responder team

533
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:48,420
are using in order to test the issues
that they're seeing coming from the

534
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,660
event platforms now from my perspective
and here's where I'm going to sort of

535
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
pull things together I actually believe
that from a person we were talking about

536
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:04,609
how complex privacy issues I believe
that in today's world there are there

537
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:08,590
are ways that we can solve from a
security perspective a lot of our

538
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:17,760
privacy problems not stamping on what it
means to you know sort of meet those

539
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,560
regulatory ames we can solve those
problems and do a really good job at it

540
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,000
so let me talk about threat detection
for a second so anybody playing with

541
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,960
machine learning

542
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:39,030
has your desired response so far ok
right there's some stuff coming out now

543
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:48,150
incredibly cool and honestly yes I took
over companies doing this but I did it

544
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,290
because when I was at IBM we had a
really bad incident we've gotten called

545
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,779
by the feds saying that something
happened one of the customer

546
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,839
environments infertile of couldn't
figure it out so we took it at all

547
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,970
put it into our network and we found
stuff we've never seen before

548
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:11,348
was just amazing but the way machine
learning works is there have been a

549
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:16,490
number of R&D projects over the past
five years as part of something called

550
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:20,459
the malware Jones gentleman project if
any of you have heard of it

551
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,790
funded and multinational focus looking
at your day malware essentially and the

552
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:32,150
concept with machine learning was to
take an engine and so think about this

553
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:38,280
is like facial recognition so facial
recognition is essentially machine

554
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,150
learning technology and so what it does
is you teach the system to understand

555
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:50,089
faces and then you're able to give it a
piece of data and it's able to identify

556
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:55,500
with in all of that you're able to find
that one picture or the sort of the

557
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,530
elements of that picture that you're
looking for now what happens in machine

558
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:07,500
learning is over five years and there's
no multinational focused on this good

559
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:14,520
software and bad software was fed into
this project so now there are machine

560
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,820
learning technologies out there that can
differentiate between good well-written

561
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:25,800
software and now we're incredibly
quickly so instead of using dynamic

562
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,900
analysis engines are people have heard
of sand boxes or fire I there's just go

563
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,300
there's blue coat there's lots and lots
of people have fire of sand boxes today

564
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:39,369
that two dynamic execution what happens
is you know those technologies they sit

565
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:41,630
on the network they see something say

566
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:46,200
kind of weird they pull it off into a
sandbox and it automatically execute the

567
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,819
code what machine learning will do is
machine learning will operate at network

568
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:58,019
at networks beach and do sort of the
classification of all of the events now

569
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:02,308
here's the interesting part it never
looks at the actual data it's only

570
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:06,880
looking at the code to provide privacy
perspective this becomes really

571
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,009
interesting because it's almost
impossible to Viet violate any of the

572
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:20,809
regulations regarding non view PII
because it's all based on the code and

573
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:25,890
what's really interesting about these
machine learning engines as well as my

574
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,240
company other companies will actually
create have created platforms where it's

575
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,140
not just the machine learning engine
that's working at wire speed but you can

576
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:42,430
also run things like anybody familiar
with Bro so this is built on a bro

577
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:47,240
analysis engines you can write the broke
rules are rules clammy

578
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,149
Metasploit third-party Intel sources all
of these things can be integrated

579
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:59,279
running in parallel at wire speed so
last year the best we could hope for

580
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:04,220
with our diners I'm sorry dynamic
approaches or our signature based

581
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,589
approaches was defined maybe fifty to
sixty percent of zero day malware in the

582
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:17,710
wild today you can find 98 percent or
more they're still there still have to

583
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:23,710
find everything they can find 98 percent
last year with taking 11 hours this year

584
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,780
it'll take you 11 millisecond

585
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:31,980
so you're talking about a just a radical
jump forward in capabilities of doing 0

586
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,830
day malware detection so I'm I'm
actually really excited about the

587
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:40,190
advances in machine learning they're not
there yet it's not there a hundred

588
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,320
percent but for the folks that are you
know sort of in your chairs I would

589
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,780
start looking at it

590
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:52,170
take a look at bro if nothing else just
start with Bro but I would be looking at

591
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,840
it because there a lot there's a lot of
talk about it and it's not just talk

592
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,840
there's a lot of value and valid
information coming out of these

593
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,840
technologies so I am going to end of
left a few minutes for some questions

594
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:14,290
but you know my point just as summarized
privacy is kind of sketchy you know

595
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:18,450
nobody knows really what it means lots
of regulations you understand where

596
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:23,230
security fits within that context and
you know the big issue from a security

597
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,520
and privacy perspective is really around
the monitoring I really think that there

598
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:35,530
is going to be a shift as we move into
the next few years you know there's two

599
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:40,350
reasons why people like me get to spend
money crisis the board you know read a

600
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,040
news article and share them so they
called me and said I had to spend money

601
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,580
that happened you know for the past few
years now we're moving into compliance

602
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:54,380
orientation a lot of legislations are
coming up with new cyber laws that are

603
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,710
dictating what we need to do one of
those things by the way is Black Swan

604
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:04,860
events so you understand it that's what
the theory is that the EU is gonna be

605
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,210
promulgating a rag on the fiber side
that requires Black Swan testing of all

606
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,520
enterprises and we believe that most
nations are going to adhere to that

607
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:19,460
particular requirement I do think that
capabilities like machine learning are

608
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,160
going to change the way we do security I
think it's gonna be incredibly valuable

609
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:29,629
and I do think but at the end of the day
it is all about building security inside

610
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:34,550
so the more we can focus on Deb ops
actual building security within the

611
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,440
software the better

612
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:42,190
it'll be that's it I am going to now
take questions anybody have any

613
00:55:42,190 --> 00:56:33,950
questions like to share with each other
maybe some details so you know without

614
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:39,078
releasing but still you know like I'm
becoming extremely paranoid to see

615
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:44,980
something wrong because I know that I'm
recorded so I have to the state I have

616
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:52,530
to feel my cock so much and I'm really
becoming paranoid so we start with a

617
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:58,109
premise already here at the security
conferences and the second thing which I

618
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:03,529
wanted to say really like it like this
that you're having a rising problem from

619
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:14,119
Middle East Europe or Asia the Middle
East but the problem is also in the in

620
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:19,250
the West Road companies don't know how
to protect her to hire them

621
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:23,310
to detain them within the organization
most of my friends they are freelancers

622
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:28,960
who work on some great project because
companies they don't want to understand

623
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,030
sometimes a little bit awkward and
strange but the weather doing what it do

624
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:38,920
it so the company's yeah they think that
hackers somebody has to be issued been

625
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,730
able to speak to the customer and
whatnot so most people prefer from home

626
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:48,740
and I want to touch on that last point
because I think you're on a really

627
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:55,399
important point there is a huge
generational gap insecurity huge and

628
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,430
it's actually gonna be talking tomorrow
on instead of diversity and I was

629
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:04,899
mentioning it earlier it's not just
women being integrated and teens for

630
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,840
people of different you know religious
or ethnic backgrounds being integrated

631
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:15,240
teams it's generations being integrated
and teams I can tell you that if I have

632
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:21,950
worked for work for companies seen
companies where frankly and forgive me

633
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:27,629
but the the security program has risen
and the security managers are pretty

634
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:32,340
much older white guys and they have a
very vivid comfort defense an Intel

635
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:37,100
neighbor very specific approach and to
them it's lock it down

636
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,970
lockdown lockdown lucky town they don't
get it and you know I've always

637
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:48,649
advocated you got it and where the
proletariat when it comes to managing my

638
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,350
teams you got to have people from
different working as a different vantage

639
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:57,480
points providing a perspective because
you need different thinking and I can

640
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,570
tell you you know having been in your
shoes i mean work from home it is

641
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:12,720
managing you guys I mean there is a and
and you know sort of came up in the

642
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,310
ranks

643
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:18,290
you know there is an expectation you go
to the office yet we're seeing you guys

644
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:22,720
you could be work in backpacking in the
paula I don't know where you are and you

645
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:30,359
know what I shouldn't care so I had to
you know as I got more mature in my own

646
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,170
career I began to realize

647
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,660
eyes that you know a good security
manager has to recognize the DNA of the

648
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,339
people that work with them and I've
always had this for philosophy that I

649
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:43,660
don't care where my people work as long
as they work I don't care when they work

650
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,520
as long as they work I care about the
outcome I don't care about how many

651
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,920
hours you put in if you can get your job
done in three hours

652
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,940
god bless if but they're sometimes you
might be working you know 48 hours

653
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,940
straight and that's my expectation but I
do think that today in the security

654
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:07,450
world there is a generation gap there is
a gap what I want to see though is more

655
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:13,899
of you guys thinking about what's your
career path little bit of mom education

656
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:20,329
right because at the end of the day
somebody's gotta replace me which one of

657
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:26,650
you is it to think about that what's
what do you wanna be when you grow up

658
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:34,190
and I think that if you can also get a
two way street I think the more you can

659
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:38,760
integrate and understand and that's why
I wanted to spend time talking about it

660
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,290
you know from the mom perspective how I
see it as I see so is for you to be

661
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:47,240
successful you have to know how I think
for me to be successful I have to know

662
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:54,129
how you think I think great plane but
thats we gotta converge wondered if you

663
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,930
could try to clarify initially during
the talk you were speaking about that

664
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:02,470
you had to deal with an 85 countries
different regulations rules regarding

665
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:07,020
privacy or security but then you also
said that you don't care where your

666
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,780
workers are working well if they're into
a country that you don't already have

667
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:14,510
regulation periods where data privacy
rules are gonna conflict and there's

668
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:18,730
gonna be customer data there then you do
have to care for your employer no no I

669
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,670
think the right now

670
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:28,480
when I said I don't care I don't care
they can work anywhere they were from

671
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:35,760
north korea probably not do I care about
what kind of devices that they're using

672
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:42,150
when they're in those countries do and
so you know my approach has always been

673
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:49,250
you know just from a more pragmatic
perspective when I look at the just the

674
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,150
engineering organizations that system
development developers administrators

675
01:01:53,150 --> 01:02:00,780
folks like you I always classified the
users within my company with different

676
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:05,290
risk profiles so I had system admins and
others who have systems access and

677
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:10,650
developers are systems access I have
regulated data users I have the general

678
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,829
population I have the senior vice
presidents that have a completely

679
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:18,420
different user profile than what I would
do it so I had those different user

680
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:26,640
profiles to say higher risk medium risk
low risk weird risk and of those user

681
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:33,359
profiles I teared countries and I have
like what tier 1 tier 2 tier three and

682
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,880
then what I would do with I would map
what you needed to do based on who you

683
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,980
were and so if I had an employee who
came to me and I've literally had this

684
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:49,420
happen sam gonna be hiking base camp to
Everest I need access what would I do

685
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:55,180
you sort of have to look at say okay
tier 3 you know country base system a

686
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:00,890
system admin how do you marry the two
together sometimes their differences but

687
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:07,940
I think what you find is most the time
it's not a technology-based issue it's

688
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:12,079
really more of a policy issue that needs
to change but I can talk to you more

689
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:20,270
about that on break but nice that you're
right you do care but much

690
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:33,180
got organizations in asia come to us
three years will train you to be a

691
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:41,910
college and it's becoming a big parking
lots of students there what do you think

692
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:49,100
the risk of that side having people are
not qualified to climb I'll effort is

693
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,940
being on top notch Persson yeah right

694
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,600
yeah well I think first of all that's
false promises it's one of those who

695
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:05,610
know I call now you can make a hundred
million dollars don't believe it but so

696
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:14,000
anybody who wants to be a C so in order
to be an effective see so there's really

697
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,750
two things that you need and I don't
care what ppl promise you to be a good

698
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:26,100
see so you need to understand the
business you have to understand how
