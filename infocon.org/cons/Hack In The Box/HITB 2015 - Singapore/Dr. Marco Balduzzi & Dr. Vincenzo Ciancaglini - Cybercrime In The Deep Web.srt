1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:01:09,670
good chance of a project here was to ok
let's start to collect as much as we can

2
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:17,679
try to do an analysis can automated way
and see what we can fine so briefly both

3
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:24,159
workin nowadays for micro a senior
researchers and going to CVS does for a

4
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,109
friends because we have a bunch of the
rights over time so they were on the map

5
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:35,179
of today's they said international the
2008 also kind of internal and explain

6
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,789
what we can do with all kind of a nice
weekend do they represent some of the

7
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:42,960
things we saw in the deep going from
illegal trading trading off a sporting

8
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,199
goods to deliver for example and I we
conclude with some nice honor so we're

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:02:00,090
leaving our talk to come back when we go
tomorrow sexual ok thanks Mark so

10
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,820
let me start by being extremely saddened
to hear these are three definitions that

11
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,348
you will find around reading about the
deep within so on and it's important to

12
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:15,238
have been here so the deep web as a buzz
word came out about ten fifteen years

13
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,849
ago with the first research when
researchers trying to try to fight what

14
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,940
was the right to estimate what the
actual sides of content that would not

15
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,530
be called by search engines all an index
content on the internet which means in

16
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,250
the street their sense also everything
that he's for example dynamic web pages

17
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,720
they just sites you know behind logins
your home banking site for example might

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,260
very well you know falling to these
definitions any site with a proper

19
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,959
robotics team leader that mean this is
the broad definition of the then we got

20
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,500
dark nights which are what you might
imagine their liked or actual software

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,079
that creates an overlay network private
overlay network usually aim to

22
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:08,170
anonymously securely traceable way and
so on and then you get the dog which is

23
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:15,608
web content posted on darkness so those
things like human services and so keen

24
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,560
insight that you find them tour and I
and we need to make this distinction

25
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,720
because more often than not you find
quotes like this now I don't know

26
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,139
anything about you watched already did
you put the commentary it's a

27
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:34,849
documentary came out this year about the
whole silkroad trial the whole you know

28
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,700
when that happened on the back and so
well and you watch the trailer on the

29
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,500
internet maybe not now like later on and
it opens with these centers you know

30
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,680
very dark void that says the deep web is
but thousands of times larger than the

31
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,280
service web which is formally correct if
you take the original definition of

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,849
course you got your home banking sites
and everything but if you look at the

33
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:04,750
end of a double truth like it's true
that it's badass any true that you got

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,219
some of the issues content on top when
you take the two conditions together and

35
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,650
you want to focus on what's interesting

36
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,799
there because they want you to as they
claim it is so this is the first thing

37
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,989
that is important to consider like that
D major Op an iceberg with the deep

38
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,570
survey steep and you know the massive
ice submerged confident top doesn't

39
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,550
really apply when you look at site like
about bringing old sites and about

40
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,590
cybercrime material for example so in
our research we wanted to focus on this

41
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:42,070
subset of the particular so we wanted to
focus on what these dark web so again

42
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,150
tour he liked or I could be free and it
was another one we also tried to look at

43
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,549
things like custom DNS so services like
name calling and Mr Cowen's or and

44
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,990
wanted to keep an eye also what are
still existing road top-level domains

45
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,669
because all these systems might offer
you know to cybercriminals basically

46
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,799
infrastructure to be resilient to law
enforcement actions like seen holding or

47
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,010
takedowns or at least make it difficult
I'll probably make it very difficult

48
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,210
they could offer you know places to
securely share grew marketplaces and so

49
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,780
on any generally not provide a safe
haven or so this is our subsidy now

50
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:37,260
raise your hands you know more or less
what or i three men are ok accident so I

51
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,849
go very weak in the next few slight so
the oldest one of all is actually the

52
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:46,740
main difference is important here the
main difference between Tournai to be

53
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,330
just that it doesn't really provide
services like service encrypted

54
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,159
connections of servers provides data
lookup so there are static resources

55
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:00,630
like but pages and pictures or files in
general identified by a key issue a

56
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,560
Request in your neighborhood your
request for a key to get going until

57
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,020
it's found some work getting back got
your thing so you can't really have you

58
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,219
know full-fledged servers but you can
still hold static sites following the

59
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:21,540
son of AI to be was actually beat you
get full web

60
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,960
allows you to access hidden services
usually very dainty by by a dog I to pee

61
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,340
top-level domain he has a routing system
called garlic routing which relies on a

62
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,070
set of increased the tunnels with
multiple levels and so on and so forth

63
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,580
then you got tour again big thing here
as you know initially it was just for

64
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,440
anonymous browsing gold surface website
go on your site and being anonymous

65
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,350
there later time they actually managed
to implement the services on top so

66
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,070
Haute services anonymously for both user
and server their onion routing in

67
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,540
multi-hop routing with multiple
encryption keys so that every step of

68
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,380
the routing you never know exactly where
they came from and where is it going

69
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:13,130
just no reviews the next step at every
word I'm thinking that Mr Cowen's these

70
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,170
are pretty much an alternative system
DNS where the way to register your

71
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,470
domain works not throughway

72
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,500
regulating institution but through the
block chain aging like a lot change

73
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,350
except that instead of storing payment
transactions youth or domain name

74
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,420
registrations so you know they'd be
centralized

75
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,350
regulating institution makes it very
nice system to reduce their leashes and

76
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,700
then we start the wanted to keep an eye
also on the old roti of these you know

77
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,330
these were very popular in the nineties
where you have competing system for DNS

78
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,479
registrations with their top level
domains there are still some out there

79
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,130
that offer these custom DNS mostly for
political reasons or battery craziness

80
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,140
and you know it could still offer
malicious actors way to actually being

81
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,360
registered domains outside of the you
can

82
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,419
so with this in mind we decided to
pretty much develop a tool to support

83
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:28,740
our team on an analysis investigators
that they could use to you know do

84
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,269
research on the content of the report so
collect all the date that we could find

85
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:40,649
pretty much related to deepen your else
so tour I to be custom domains and so on

86
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,659
we wanted to provide them with the tools
that they could use during their

87
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,390
investigations at all for us to do some
research and find interesting content so

88
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,959
this is a broad overview of the system
we pretty much have a blog that takes

89
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,170
care again position so we tried to reach
a much higher missed your house from

90
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:05,260
everywhere we can we eat those URLs in
terms of the events when we find one

91
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,160
the ural themselves so we indict them as
complex objects so that we could take

92
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,500
south of them and we also scouting
information so that their step is

93
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,470
actually going to call to see what is
their website is there some open ports

94
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,350
there's a website what what are the HTTP
headers was seen it might be useful

95
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,740
actually on their own

96
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,160
what's the page gone full screen shots
and all sorts of stuff we had reached

97
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,170
that data for example some ratings for
the links clustered attacks in order to

98
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,680
get some people were clothed and so on
and we can examine the date that using

99
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,510
two interfaces one is a website that we
used to pretty much look at the data

100
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,310
base of the skull today tell you what it
looks like what the content there and we

101
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,859
used a banner for those of you

102
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,529
1088 a

103
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:04,199
analytics tool that allows us pretty
much do you know trend analyses a great

104
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,660
aggregate together a date

105
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,870
pretty much pulled a nice charged that
you're gonna see soon enough so in terms

106
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,379
of data sources this is what we try to
money so we got user data and user data

107
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,160
pretty much

108
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,129
we can see all the connections that come
from our users on my way we pull all the

109
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:30,889
connections the URL that are deeply
related or

110
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,850
tour gateways liked or 12.org or things
like that I to be and so on

111
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,540
we monitor base been sites like this
being the Black Sea and so on and so

112
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,488
forth to look for new york else we had
access to a 1% with their feed which

113
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:52,049
will eventually become a full featured
eight hours just to see exactly somebody

114
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:57,669
publishes you the URL link week we
monitor or edit and some subreddits like

115
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,459
are on our tour are dark knit
marketplace's I think and some out there

116
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:11,049
there are some actual websites that host
pages full of Bureau deepen links

117
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:16,459
like dot com or things like that we just
scrape them periodically to find some

118
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,459
new upcoming meetings or gateway so as I
mentioned their gateway slide toward

119
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:27,219
12.org or on da cab on Oct and so on
which allows you to access services on

120
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,899
tour

121
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,649
pretty much without having to reinstall
now you're not guarantee the needy but

122
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,220
you can still access the Konkan malware
for example some malware can use it

123
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,589
seems we don't really care about being
on the client side in that sense and the

124
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:44,319
good thing about this website is that
they keep statistics on what are the

125
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:49,238
most taxes he does services per day so
we can just access those that he thinks

126
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,119
they're probably and we pretty much get
the least of the most popular he

127
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:58,529
deserves any given day I took those
files so this is something if you

128
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,999
remembered you know the old server
dalton et file this is something senior

129
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:08,189
it's pretty much a text file that gives
you a plain-text least I to be domains

130
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:13,500
in a readable format with their
corresponding Ashby which is the actual

131
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,850
actual domain so they are text files
again you can download them and sort of

132
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,700
use them to update your right to be
instance but we use them again to find

133
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,330
you know newly registered sites for
example and then of course when we've

134
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,390
got the page and we we feed them back to
the to the system actually as new data

135
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:40,360
source of his own in order to access the
whole on some of the services we

136
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,450
actually have a machine that acts as a
universal proxy has a call it's so

137
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,080
pretty much runs a squid a transparent
proxy that depending on the request

138
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,720
pretty much forward that you know if
you're going forward the 264 tour

139
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,870
instances running political Ethan I do P

140
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,080
we have an idea being since its free net
there's a free running there and you can

141
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,100
resolve DNS for pretty much every bit as
providers like their normal domain or

142
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,470
old name-calling or ok so you pretty
much just connect to one poor thang you

143
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,360
can resolve and access all the dating
there which makes it pretty convenient

144
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,100
either you got a researcher and just use
that as your tunnel to inspect the

145
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,059
content or you know for all the ultimate

146
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,919
they can retrieve it makes things way
WAY easier

147
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,419
up a scout thing so this is the kind of
information we retreat so we have a

148
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:36,889
headless browser that goes you know
connects to the URL and price of petrol

149
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:42,289
this information so it that she is the
full are long so all the connections not

150
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,409
just the right direction train like
everything that comes out of the browser

151
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:50,669
page it renders the full page so even if
they are then I mean pages with

152
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:54,679
JavaScript that's what we get the final
rendering and then we spread the tax get

153
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:59,919
the screenshot title tax ultimate the
date such as a major tax keywords and so

154
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,759
on

155
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,749
we story they're always Gmail and we
parse the page for links emails and

156
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:12,419
becoming wallet to do this we actually
nice piece of software which is called

157
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,689
scraping a splash which is basically a
cutie web meetings so the engine it's

158
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,639
pretty much the same HTML engine did you
find in Google Chrome package United

159
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,519
Soccer container so just need to
download it and run it pretty much and

160
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,729
it saves a lot of hassle basically you
can strip even though I actually

161
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,519
supports no script filled Thursday if
you need to

162
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,659
and again very nice things that need to
be traces so to actually actions that we

163
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:46,429
patched a couple of pythons middleware
libraries are scraping the library so if

164
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,539
you use greatly before you know you can
add me to wear that much work rework

165
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,049
your URL and reaches them before
throwing the request so we passed them

166
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,949
so that we could you splash together
with some shared you so that we can

167
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,649
lunch multiprocessors basically end you
know better performances and then as i

168
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,799
mentioned you know extra links emails
between wallets and so on in terms of

169
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,629
their reach meant this is what we do so
for all the links that we pull out of

170
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:17,439
the pages we get our web reputation
system and see the links might be

171
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:23,209
militias might be safe and your money
issues why

172
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:28,170
proxy deck disease Dr the militias just
because you know might be the tour web

173
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:34,860
page and then its proxy board may be
considerably should we do translation so

174
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,740
we first that the language using a
Python library and Google Translate and

175
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,589
defeat the non-english page we try to
pull the English text back and related

176
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,300
with English thats what we do we
actually tried to pull a meeting and

177
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,219
working out which means that we compute
a workout after having done some

178
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,300
clustering of the words based on their
meaning and the classroom basically

179
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,809
works this way so we gonna be tax
information came at the end up spaces

180
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:04,850
and so on

181
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,089
we do it organization of the text so
from the text we get to at least of word

182
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,790
frequency bears this work has appeared
by turns into text this work has

183
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,240
appeared ten times as the one we feel
free to keep only substantive so take

184
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,959
away birds adjectives adverbs just
substitute deeds or lease of the

185
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,189
substance we do a distance metrics
semantic distance metrics which means

186
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:34,599
that we compute how far are words from
one another so take for example the

187
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,699
world baseball and basketball these two
words would actually be very close to

188
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,240
meeting because they're both supports if
I take say

189
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,110
car and cat is worth anything anymore

190
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,589
the mechanical thing basically so there
is a librarian pipe and cold war net

191
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,790
which is used to do such things they
already have compiled a whole least grab

192
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,310
of meanings of the words in English so
you can basically use it to compute

193
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,030
again distances between words and their
meanings according to their

194
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,170
categorization once we have the distance
we use it to say your article plastering

195
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,120
so we grouped together word that are
similar like DBA least origin so on and

196
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,669
we labeled each class they're staking
the first word of the group alphabetical

197
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,819
order the cluster get a overall
frequency which is the sum of all the

198
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:26,599
frequencies in the word and then use
that information to draw a workload the

199
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,928
purpose of all this mess it's pretty
much to be able if you're an honest then

200
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,600
you end up for example

201
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,850
non-english page such as this

202
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,110
to get the glans you know the general
topic of the page so here we got a

203
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,280
Russian silkroad something something I
don't speak russian so you know there's

204
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,480
a good talk about flowers and cooking
but then again spot from the word cloud

205
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,169
immediately that he's in a full rainbow
trading resources and so on that can you

206
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,190
know see immediately that something that
interests me or not for example if I'm

207
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:06,530
doing an investigation in terms of
storage search which e a full text

208
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,658
search engine it working in early to
solar wore those of you who know it

209
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,809
relies on inverted indices basically to
index your data so you feed him a text

210
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,639
document converted into tokens and then
can tell you that that were the pier

211
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,590
than this document this document in
these documents so it allows us

212
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,730
basically two free text search right
away just a couple of words and you can

213
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,070
get your results

214
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,320
it also allows us to do some structure
queries and will see them in the mean

215
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,360
like where you are a like actually asked
for all the URLs that contain a certain

216
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,020
queries part of their name excuse for
example it allows us to do an Olympics

217
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,168
so we can do both aur else so see for
example how popular certainly part of

218
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,750
injuries or when we see when we first
saw appearing a combination of host name

219
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,590
and path first day we saw it appearing
weak and when the school data you'll see

220
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,490
what languages are most popular and so
on and again we can use either combine

221
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,150
our our portal to do that exploration
there so this is the collect the date

222
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,530
that we had this year we had the system
running for two years now almost we

223
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:22,330
collected overall a 45 media ban meaning
that by even a URL doesn't necessarily

224
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,699
mean it's a new one but we spot that

225
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,690
in one of the sources we collected one
was six on six hundred thousand

226
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,010
individual URLs for a total that should
be like twenty thousand domains either

227
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,399
take keeping in mind that you know what
they do is very volatile you're looking

228
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,500
at the date at a certain moment then the
next day decided there's operation on

229
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,559
all of a sudden two thousand domains so
you know this is a historical number of

230
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,149
domains acted remains at the moment we
are probably around 10,000 sites like

231
00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:00,549
the last couple of weeks so without
further ado I prepared a couple of

232
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:07,220
videos to show you exactly what it looks
like so this one is again the main page

233
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,240
in the URL and we got our generals that
these things that tells us you know the

234
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,029
sources of doing well and here we have
all our URL speaking much grew by

235
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:21,980
hostname and we could actually searched
according to multiple

236
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,370
green URL means that we scouted
successful yellow means that we had an

237
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,489
error when you try to connect 480 and
read news that is not issues we could

238
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:36,039
actually searched by for example to meet
with type of a URL in this case you want

239
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,139
to feel then just get the IP demands we
can filter in just fine malicious

240
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:45,289
domains which means domains that contain
pages that had many shoes links here we

241
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,090
found for example has come for you that
they to be which is a country be

242
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,928
serviced so he basically allows you to
test your malware against told the

243
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:58,100
eighty engines and find out that acted
or not so if you see we can have the

244
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,949
potty break down for a spring break down
and then you've got all your information

245
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:07,389
HTTP headers a title you got your work
out there which gives you get the idea

246
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:08,729
of what he does

247
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:15,100
screenshot there are the work last Thurs
again as you see we grouped together

248
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,469
things like least database black least
this one by one software and so forth

249
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:30,380
the sort of reduced the amount of work
that we got under their there and

250
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,940
they're there we got the links in green
you have the safelink untested in yellow

251
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,870
and malicious

252
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,559
and why in red and then all the other
things like made the tags keyboards and

253
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,639
so on so this was somewhat concerned
your house then for the scouting page we

254
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,900
have another tab which allows you to
search through the information we we we

255
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,900
crawled all the pages so he is the least
of the late this sculpted pages now we

256
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,510
wanted to make a pic experiments he's a
complete I packing box would appear so

257
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:11,080
we just need a week free text search and
we got well one website that seemed to

258
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,980
have the key word there which is an Open
Directory actually so if I open it up I

259
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,970
can see that well first we get the right
direction change and we can log over

260
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,420
here so I 30 100 which is always useful
cuz you never know what you can find

261
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,679
from there in this case it's an open
directory so the workload is pretty much

262
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,360
just you know directory and somehow so
it doesn't really tell you much but you

263
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,979
can see from the screen showed that is
pretty much just a directory listing if

264
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,590
we go down we can see that one of the
directory folder right here is our HID

265
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:49,639
me so this seemed to be just a
collection of magazines but the

266
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,510
interesting thing here on the topic of
open directories I can actually use the

267
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,470
system to find for example the Open
Directory certain kind of a band

268
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,450
director so there's a four-month Open
Directory

269
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,480
generated by W get that it's known
because it generates

270
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,000
a URL in the form of that contains the
query parameter name seat and a second

271
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,070
which is the sorting criteria and
another query parameter 90 which is the

272
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,220
sorting order now I can just look for
those two parameters and pretty much

273
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,330
find all the open directories that we
scouted

274
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,949
there which is a fairly interesting
thing in there cuz you can then go and

275
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,910
look exactly he's an interesting content
defeats I don't know some damn images or

276
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,380
other day so we got that their projects
for example to the dedicated to that

277
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,480
just means you're else together projects
and there again you know your directory

278
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,570
listing workload in these cases doesn't
really help much just a collection of

279
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:56,470
our files but feel this is the kind of
queries that we can do over there so

280
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,340
moving on

281
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,949
let's see some examples exactly are
things that we managed to find with our

282
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,820
systems basically and you know some nice
examples of stuff that you can find

283
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,399
among all the websites so first of all
guns I mean who doesn't like guns anyway

284
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,230
you know people of guns and here you
know if you live in the UK apparently or

285
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,030
you could then I visited the site will
be online but for like one point for me

286
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,299
calling you can buy it fool and reduced
Oregon and you know you've done stuff

287
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:32,970
like guns anyway so drugs I mean I think
I needed to mention it but of course

288
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,130
this is what people know that he put for
you can buy every sort of drugs cocaine

289
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,440
heroine mushrooms as the weather is your
deal just go up there and you know face

290
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,190
probably incarceration deal this is
pretty much eighty percent of all the

291
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:55,450
trade Kings traded in the marketplace
suggest that to me big driver more

292
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,390
interesting stuff

293
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,970
passports a fake IDs so there's more
than one website that offers counterfeit

294
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,870
passports accomplished a fake IDs UCSD's
a sheep's all sorts of stuff now this

295
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,110
even you know you measure the organizer
I just wanted to show them that I could

296
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,949
actually get the Malaysian possible for
450 viewers

297
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,559
with 650 I could actually get the
driver's license you know and greetings

298
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,340
to the country in case they needed to
you can actually get him and copies and

299
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,840
everything well here of course I mean
the most expensive one seems to be the

300
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,189
you with a passport for obvious reasons

301
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:35,700
moving on counterfeit money yet here we
show an example we Chinese Chinese notes

302
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,149
but you can pretty much any bank note of
the well at least the most famous one

303
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:46,418
Chinese notes European us' dollars every
sort of stuff it's right there for the

304
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,980
peking or at least that's what they
claim the one thing about this these

305
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,600
marketplaces is that you know they
claimed was senior stuff but you're

306
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,559
still buying on beat going switch is
untraceable and you know it really

307
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,668
taking back your scan and you know
they're shipping from nowhere you don't

308
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,970
know where they are so they say they
will say you come to feed mine but then

309
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:09,350
you know we're not really allowed to go
and try it because that would be

310
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,469
financing go BC of criminal activities
so this is what they claim credit cards

311
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:21,279
stolen and cloned credit cards you can
see that you know for $90 you can

312
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,070
actually get a nice 2000 he's a card
with a 500 limit of course they hired to

313
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,428
balance the higher the price over here
you're kinda communion provided that

314
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:32,690
they work

315
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:41,480
PayPal account here they're sailing
bundles so with $100 you can actually

316
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,750
get 200 people accounts with an average
of 20% working and they even have a kind

317
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,950
of a cashback if you like we will they
will replace them if more than 90% of

318
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,850
work so in the end you pay $100 for
probably eighty people accounts working

319
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,899
again if you have to do social
engineering and stuff like that this is

320
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,059
the kind of things you're looking for

321
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,158
Daxing so there are some pages that
actually provide public information of

322
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,889
high profile figures in this case we got
bill and hillary clinton Sarah Palin and

323
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:16,789
addresses you know he will let these
obvious uncalled for because you know

324
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,240
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the White
House so there's not much you know it's

325
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,710
not such a big news that he believed in
the white house

326
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,649
Joe Biden and so one that's actually the
picture of the address above you can

327
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:37,789
actually find a sausage so there are 23
pages that claim they will offer you

328
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,899
assassination services if you pay you
know and get some of the guys that like

329
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:46,059
they will get read for your bed lethal
annoyance in your life that's actually a

330
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:51,289
day to find it so here as well 5,000
euros you can kill a person that makes

331
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:57,520
it so easy then again keeping mine you
know I had no way of saying if this is

332
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,220
legit or not most likely know it's
probably something I have no way of

333
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,970
saying but think about this

334
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:10,360
eat by a you know the chance of setting
a website that is untraceable most part

335
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,350
it's him then and I can stay anonymous
and I can receive payment currency that

336
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,539
is traceable as well and pretty much can
not taken back and I had the chance to

337
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,529
sort the scan the kind of people who
cannot really go to the police to say

338
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:29,860
that they got scammed by trying to hire
an assassin well you know that's

339
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,139
something that I would do it looks like
a business plan you can you not like

340
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,330
anybody is going to go to the police and
you know that they want they spent five

341
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:46,260
thousand euros on the topic of scans
this is another interesting thing this

342
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,710
was on a website that you know he broke
the thing on a whole new level this is

343
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:57,169
like a Kickstarter campaign for evil so
big I would you like to get projects

344
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:02,179
like association project like my cube
ran the business executives so Justin

345
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:06,399
Bieber of course the guys are trying to
crowd find and collect money to kill

346
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,120
these guys so you know that's why we're
trying to kill if you want just send us

347
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,729
beat going and when we reach a certain
amount that think it was two million

348
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,429
dollars for Obama you know they will
certainly hire an assassin

349
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:22,869
and you know make the deets in your
stead for me again

350
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:26,049
think about it you know if you really
had to put the website then know that

351
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:30,379
you'll be untraceable and you can get
money that you cannot be taken back

352
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:38,230
would you do that just me that again I
haven't tried to crowdfunding myself but

353
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:46,210
there's a proven Justin Bieber's so far
so let's move to a more and more on

354
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,919
ethics part here in just gonna show you
some of the date that we actually pulled

355
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,850
out a knife

356
00:29:50,850 --> 00:30:00,119
protocol breakdown so this is a is the
breakdown of all the schemes we found in

357
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:05,658
the public URL we got source so these
are not like active port scanning and

358
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:09,509
stuff we collected or else what were the
names of these URL so I took away of

359
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:13,879
course HTTP and HTTPS that being like
90% of what we found

360
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,330
clearly most websites if we take them
off we can see we still have a fair

361
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:25,918
amount of IRC site YRC URLs 172 board we
got IRCs like seventeen or less and XMPP

362
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,220
D Street are very interesting because
these could very well be used for

363
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,389
infrastructure person sees or you know
rendezvous points for militias doctors

364
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:40,168
appt the job of prime instant messaging
if we do a more active scan these days

365
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:44,179
with the ports can we actually did we
found in the

366
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:48,039
probably like two days ago doing this
kind of all the demands we got we

367
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:57,299
actually found 49 IRC servers 31 IRCs
and 855 SSH port open in all the demands

368
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:02,830
which kind of interesting and you know
among the sites these 11 of the IRC

369
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:10,970
servers that an extra something seems to
be over control and so on and had a nice

370
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:20,070
channel 303 animals which seems to be a
channel to give support for arrested in

371
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,340
terms of languages of course per domain
English seems to be the one who had the

372
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,549
highest number of the mains full of a
Russian if I take them away

373
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,980
equation what's left is like French
German and Catherine on Portuguese these

374
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,730
are two main languages that you can find
the Chinese for example in the smallest

375
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,799
part this is an example of a Chinese
site Google Translate told me that these

376
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:52,289
are trading rules for a Chinese
marketplace reckoned that you might get

377
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:58,110
the better meaning that I do in terms of
suspicious links again we can actually

378
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,080
find the pages the pages with more links
Dean suspicious the terms of you know

379
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,210
and so on so these 10 that was one of
the pages we found a marketplace where

380
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,370
people are basically said adding you
know

381
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,559
a pain and things like that

382
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:24,129
forum indications so that we can do
while we describe the emails is that we

383
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:30,130
can find out you know what are the most
popular emails which site and so on

384
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,280
parasites and what are the related
emails so in here the most popular not

385
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,940
really dead interesting because some are
just gibberish like we use a regular

386
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,360
expressions are you see you know we got
the star star star which doesn't really

387
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,010
mean much easier to mail that I could
beat as one of the developers of a to be

388
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,540
so we again doesn't mean but if you look
into the lowest all we Gott being like

389
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,240
toxic poison @ yahoo.com that seems very
interesting we got some guy who's called

390
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,030
Bank of America email to tour which was
kinda caught our attention there and if

391
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:10,160
we click on that and we see associate
email addresses we can see that you

392
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,580
generally appears in pages together with
other ideas such as new code 39 cycle

393
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,189
Tokyo and so on

394
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,700
now we went on our portal and search for
pages containing these email and what we

395
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:32,050
found for example was this forum post on
the exam your forum where seems to talk

396
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,389
about you know saddling credit cards
stolen credit cards by these local guy

397
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,910
and we see down in the forum that
there's basically bankamerica guy

398
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,760
answering so we can see these kind of
interaction role social network analysis

399
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,679
in terms of Bitcoin identification we
ran again irregular defined is becoming

400
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,590
wallet and we find more or less

401
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:59,409
1200 because there and we consider that
not to be the whole the total amount

402
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:05,410
because some sites like you're seeing a
few minutes actually employees

403
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,720
application techniques for the Beacon
wallet like for example there's some

404
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,560
pages that would take the wallet and
instead of showing the whole stream they

405
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,320
will split it in two blocks of 23
characters in the HTML code and then use

406
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,460
a CSS just to rebuild the whole thing so
you will see the full well that

407
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,320
iran-iraq X to find you know streams
between 23 and 26 character starting

408
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,609
with not one or three and so on

409
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:34,500
you will not find those but there's any
way to a number of proper willett

410
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,730
candidate and the topic of bitcoins
since you know this is actually the the

411
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,550
concurrence with these are the kind of
services that we will find we got time

412
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,679
for example so which is pretty much
money laundering so you send them you

413
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:53,060
know ten points they retain a fee and
they send you back you know ten people's

414
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,770
minds defeat which happens to be clear
this is because it going to encrypt

415
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:04,750
occurrences in general have this feature
that they are untraceable as long as

416
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,470
there's no way of linking your name to
your beating wall so you know there are

417
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,640
you don't leave out any information that
I use your name or your use or to become

418
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,549
all that they are safe but from your
beat going well that which is pretty

419
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:22,450
much a shrink it is the full transaction
that juries public so that they can

420
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,799
pretty much gold way back and see all
the transactions that you know that to

421
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,420
your wallet and going for it they can
pull up all that you're doing the

422
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,740
problem that law enforcement having is
that they cannot generally type of

423
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,779
person so to solve the first issue there
are time there's like this that pretty

424
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,349
much means you some money that is

425
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,369
tumbled around so that following a
bitter that the transaction changes on

426
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:51,700
the other side of the coin upon here
there are things like be putting

427
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,149
multiplexer which are sites that claim
that you send them you know one beat

428
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,589
going in there was a big hundred which
is probably again the way how money

429
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,599
laundering services unifying the money
to send you back to just get around the

430
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,269
money from people with the promise of
sending that money of course he might

431
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:15,569
very well be a scam as well as again
you're not gonna get back anyway but in

432
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:21,220
this particular case the site tries to
build up a reputation by actually

433
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,709
showing you you know successful
transactions then all our customers that

434
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:34,450
we got there so we're at the Marco which
is gonna talk more details about malware

435
00:36:34,450 --> 00:39:19,569
and how much we exploit the deep with 22
ok thanks

436
00:39:19,569 --> 00:40:11,819
cycle while and then some additional
doing so it seems to the campaign is and

437
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:21,619
rubbish more and more critical
introduced into the second hour better

438
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:28,660
we can do is dial back into this is

439
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:37,058
the first malware which makes use of ITP
to ask which is before something

440
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,809
different than the door so is actually
be sure that many baby doll online

441
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:47,230
banking pages at Brown's arrival and he
does in a way that basically when we

442
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:54,260
user connect with a banking login what
they what we collect back in the kind of

443
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,569
irrational approach to be but I care in
that way that I can log into the machine

444
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:08,740
development banking application of a
victim and super 8 years different

445
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:17,089
domains domain particularly used ugh you
know should I go to generate a kind of

446
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:27,150
run time control server using a clear
let and then he does it for 80 and

447
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,990
portal for free so last year some guys
from their secure is covered i care alot

448
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,029
and attribute the first time in here

449
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:44,410
hd2 to be smaller so what we did you
discover traditional being used by the

450
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:50,368
same campaign and these are actually
ever use nowadays for sample is a plot

451
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:56,349
to modernize a couple of days ago so we
can see every day there are between 40

452
00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:09,890
and 80 request request going going out
to be a common cold water and other

453
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:18,859
banking Trojan which is which used to
control server PC situation that spread

454
00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:22,850
using fishing which is a common way now
too

455
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:29,880
because she saw that decreased a lot in
the last couple of years it seems that

456
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,670
day

457
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:36,920
techniques used for spam filtering was
pretty well or days to go out and start

458
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,180
using the Spearfish eager to do their to
dispel bad weather so what's the matter

459
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:51,049
with you basically user avatar all
stayed on the normal clear web but I

460
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:59,570
peace they are they gonna graphically
into the icon five standard i confide

461
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:06,670
use my website which is 50 which is a
firstly you know first hand how to order

462
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,950
to IDBI peace in addition that he call
he's posted on the website which round

463
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:18,819
of the tournament was basically marlin
fitzwater we provide a grant of

464
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:24,680
anonymity when the user's phone call and
then inside baby securities graphically

465
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:34,299
hi baby address also and we could I call
it if you connect basically two-way one

466
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,630
of those surveyed you and you don't know
which way you can find out to what we

467
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:42,810
did there we can do

468
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:51,450
website which is one in which is a major
found that they were observed values is

469
00:43:51,450 --> 00:44:02,990
a particular version of 17 fingerprint
that we can use on our side and in

470
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:13,250
addition to that the one you can
basically quite a web 745 like a $200

471
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:19,450
for ok you get it for free which means
for being so basically using a

472
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:29,890
combination of that specific web server
which the information out because it's

473
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:37,350
so given that information to existing of
500 color-coded you basically get to

474
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:44,339
know every day fresh least of new
comment by buy the model doors and here

475
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:54,870
we have brought over time from beginning
to see that also the navy's marla is

476
00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:06,830
getting more and more prevalent and more
traffic more affection and a particular

477
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,240
type of malware is

478
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,660
seems to love it may not only because
it's the perfect place to hide but the

479
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,779
deeper providing dinner obvious
framework for cash out operations and

480
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,300
for illicit money transfer so for those
of you that or not you may be aware of

481
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:35,400
it was basically but also where is my
work computer basically your locks you

482
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,770
out from the computer every time you ok
you know you cannot use your puter

483
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:49,430
anymore because UPS website or what it
might include some of your ideas and I

484
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:55,020
ask you for your answer to pay to get
your computer or your feedback and

485
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,509
usually this is done in such a way that
you get ready right to a page where you

486
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:07,710
have to pay to pay you know about depend
from typified by the time you pay you

487
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,550
get it back so one of the goal of the
altar is it make it could still be

488
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,880
service payment ok to make use of the
reasonable one of his mother where is is

489
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,680
a variant of Krypton talker so one of
those around somewhere about increased

490
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:33,740
violence and it's so tired seal the
payment page ok and that's a page paper

491
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:38,129
you get redirected when you're getting
fracture just say ok you know you want

492
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,290
to get your feedback

493
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:50,290
you have to pay twelve twelve hundred
trillion dollars within two hours and of

494
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:56,470
course you don't pay higher from 1200
goes to 5050

495
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:03,649
$50 until you are forced to pay for
water fight back some interesting points

496
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:10,880
before the payment pages or several
things that payment which makes it more

497
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,710
difficult for law enforcement agency to
trace back to do with specially for use

498
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,810
one of the techniques chance or so
you're talking about because of his

499
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:35,609
creation and not the bad guy should be
using this system behind basically free

500
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:40,210
up the chain is no way to trace back to

501
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:49,390
never interesting things here is the
address yet but here you have addressed

502
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:55,940
it could get rendered as a beacon
address which I'll go something like

503
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:04,070
thirty years america try another case
but actually source code HTML surely has

504
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:11,070
pleaded in charge of 23 by separated by
a space and everybody's a job and show

505
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:17,640
it is that it is such a way that is very
difficult to automatically identify

506
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:26,680
those pages because the caller cannot
get the shovel in the Euro text HTML

507
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:34,210
text so what happens when the borrower
does generators

508
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:42,560
IDs what is effort called user colon
user pass so these IDs they basically

509
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:50,250
we are kind of access to grant access to
the payment page only from your machine

510
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,730
basically if you don't have this talk
and you cannot get to the page so it's a

511
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:02,830
faraway used by the outer protective
structures so what we did that we expect

512
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:08,549
out of this strange weekend what we can
do we can uprising against our system

513
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:16,069
our system automatically identify those
pages in particular

514
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:20,610
also

515
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:25,240
influence the language in which is
generated the payment page which means

516
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,560
better keep track whatever they know
they have been affected his Chinese

517
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:39,950
could be here in case of any kind of
taiwan policies or another language so

518
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:47,669
by creating our own infrastructure we
can we can quantify sample for which the

519
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:53,880
payment page and we can tell you look
you know english-speaking that you pay

520
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,780
and because it's a green rice year
followed by Turkey's French Chinese and

521
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:06,790
Italian and as well as from common
controls have arrived at the bad guy use

522
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:12,710
for example you can see that the
receiver which Israel in red

523
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:23,759
actually is used by victims UK

524
00:50:23,759 --> 00:50:34,519
very similar and very effective in the
same is not only making traditional but

525
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:44,158
actually does so any information so we
still keystroke both drunk driving

526
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:50,880
operational level password and it also
has a bit record album video using your

527
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:58,099
webcam which makes very suitable for
espionage program and so the idea is

528
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:03,949
supposed to with a low priority of our
case we do not format of the greatest

529
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:09,289
train with another way communicated to
aggressively out Koo wee possible

530
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:16,380
traffic so the idea here is that idea
was to use the textural feature the

531
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,999
popularity in the number of values
associated to parameter doesn't mean

532
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:26,459
that I can look in a short time peter
that could be like when I want one day

533
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:31,339
before his record books there in the
number of value associated with new

534
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:38,630
parameter because you can easily see
that the last day

535
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:47,329
Xu which is different than Casey ok cool
you know it's very weird behavior

536
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:54,909
especially if communicate using
basically tell you use them to

537
00:51:54,909 --> 00:52:01,099
communicate with Michael December are
encoded into interviewer itself in

538
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:03,869
particular

539
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:07,599
used to live in a parameter to
communicate with conical bra

540
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:15,509
Xu and our Exedy Exedy you experience a
huge surge in popularity and more than

541
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:22,640
700 the values over the last couple
weeks which makes it appealing it

542
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,410
interesting to the region to be sport
and i'm looking at they pay a lot a lot

543
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:33,019
easier and you are encoded binary bra
which turn out

544
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:38,189
representative it has been leaked from a
machine physical memory that she and

545
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:42,549
recording of a keystroke typing every
time you use to send out information

546
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:50,130
basically coded information by the
payload and send it to be becoming

547
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:57,450
cultural center which is a PHP script
and interesting things very interesting

548
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:00,009
point is that when you get infected

549
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:06,240
report next week americans deserve an
informational the case of operating

550
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,140
system version language where it's
located in a few girls using

551
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:22,890
accident and what it does increased by
using JSON as a way to communicate

552
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:30,058
through service so what we can do we can
plot on the acts are serious times their

553
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,920
acts like this

554
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,880
domains we can see that here for a
sample we have two lanes special about

555
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,480
all the top which is used

556
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:53,710
we can see that either blew a number of
new victims by this model which uses a

557
00:53:53,710 --> 00:54:00,240
tour of course infrastructure to operate
and there we green like the amount of

558
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:12,770
information visit to conclude here we
show you are we we collect the Iraq not

559
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:19,089
only natural that you sold your standard

560
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:25,759
tell this domain and and that allow us
to seize

561
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,010
so basically we're currently using PC's
them to do it in the final settlement

562
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:41,290
activities such as in other trading of
