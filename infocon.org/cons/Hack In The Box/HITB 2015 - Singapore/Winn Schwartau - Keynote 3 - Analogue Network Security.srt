1
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:22,230
how many people are here how many people
were out having too much fun last night

2
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,570
showed how many people think a show of
hands is really fucking stupid show of

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:37,300
hands I was out so I grew up in analog
engineer I look at security differently

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,459
in doing this

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:47,760
thirty-some-odd years to get over a cold
and I i world is kind of a mess and

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
we've heard over and over just broke and
what we're trying to do is the

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,329
next-generation firewalls gonna fix
everything right

8
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:07,570
oh which firewall you talking about the
we have to assume these days there are

9
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,960
networks are already owned by somebody
else we have some very basic assumptions

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,038
that are wrong

11
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:19,060
fundamentally and we have a lot of this
budget is the last day or so

12
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,409
steps over here where the metrics are we
measuring security and everybody I know

13
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,880
I don't know how we're going to get
tempted to see what we can do so this is

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,679
the world I grew up in analog analog kid
I did rock all that kind of stuff

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,249
learning systems learning networks but
with a different view they were all

16
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:46,920
analog networks we didn't i didnt broken
vigil we didn't have digital back in the

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,740
fifties and sixties very much so what is
analog and we're gonna start is just

18
00:01:53,740 --> 00:02:02,869
looking at this anybody know what that
is if anybody smart this is a modern

19
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,909
fearless transmission for a car that's
it we're getting rid of them when we get

20
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,950
into these new generation card so we do
away with the gears and so we have an

21
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,720
analog transmissions of the Digital
Trends

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,600
when we look at various things I know
this is hard to read but I'll give the

23
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,090
slides everybody what is analog is a yes
or no answer analog or digital when a

24
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,070
lawyer asked you a question is yes no
answer correct or is there no correct

25
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,739
answer to that is yes or no so part of
the argument to be making his when I'm

26
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,190
looking at security I want to get rid of
all zeros and all one because they are

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,870
misleading with what we're really trying
to do and awards about continuously

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:52,120
variable continuously changing nothing
is fixed nothing is absolutely locked in

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,320
so when we look at curves and then we
look at the digitize curves and

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,090
approximation curves we digitize them
but then we have to bring them back

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,200
ultimately into an analog form because
we are analog people that's what the

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,769
nature of humans are the other thing
that happens is we have a certain

33
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,350
quantum aspect to all of this we have
weighed part of the duality when it

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,350
comes to the universe and both times and
all that kind of stuff but we tend to

35
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,609
look at security as a digital function
and what I'm gonna be suggesting here is

36
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,290
that we need to look at it as a horrible
way particle duality where we have some

37
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,130
digital I suspect some analog aspects
that we need to create a hybrid of the

38
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,370
two to really get on the standing of
what's going on everything we need to do

39
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,050
is look at things as a spectrum not just
yet

40
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,750
not just no but what about all of the
things in the middle and one of the

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,810
things we used to do with the world I
grew up in was thing called min max we

42
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,350
had a recording console and we would
want to see does it work is it not work

43
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,440
when we're testing it all of that and we
cranked the knobs all the way up all the

44
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,750
way down and we have to do this which
gave us our min max condition which gave

45
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,730
us a stress test in real time before
recording session in a row live concert

46
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,858
and again we're totally in the analog
domain here but when it is gave us a

47
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:20,638
handle on

48
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,590
where things could go wrong I also argue
that the internet is down along when we

49
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,659
look at it

50
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:32,889
hold back from the zoom when we're
looking at it is that analog to digital

51
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,300
it becomes digital when we granular
arise it sufficiently when we zoom

52
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,469
loving giving them looking at a map I'm
looking at lycée by street in my house

53
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:49,509
on Google only one min so there's an
issue of granularity that we typically

54
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,710
are missing when we're talking about
security the brain

55
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,239
we are not a computer we are an
approximation engine when you study

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,919
neuro sciences that's all we are is some
level of approximation your visual field

57
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,089
only sees two percent of what you think
you're seeing the rest of it as an

58
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:17,229
averaging the brain feels it on its own

59
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,360
to be able to give you a field of view
but we only concede really two percent

60
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,460
of focus and in the world we're living
in with securing we're trying to do 100%

61
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:36,169
focus on things that really don't matter
so now we're tying humans and all the

62
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:41,639
stuff together and we're trying to get
digital technology to talk to analog us

63
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,389
humans and we're learning all over again
that the language is very very different

64
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,580
than we had originally thought it was so
let's go back to security models we

65
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,520
started talking about this little bit
yesterday fortress mentality the walls

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,810
of the castle this is a binary version
of you will not come into my castle you

67
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:12,589
will not get into my network how's that
working for us all that's going well

68
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:18,169
yeah it doesn't work this has been the
model for warfare or six thousand years

69
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:23,659
build a wall high build a moat the
building as you possibly can you'll

70
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:29,190
never get it but we also know it doesn't
work it's static its best

71
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,250
so we've applied this kind of mindset
said we're going to the same thing back

72
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,260
in 88 89 trust would Delavan started
saying we're gonna build a firewall will

73
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,430
have rules on it and nobody's going to
get into our networks and we also know

74
00:06:41,430 --> 00:07:00,430
that does not work please take a read of
this 41 seconds when anybody when was

75
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:14,130
this red 19085 no 1972

76
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,710
what we're still dealing with today

77
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,430
rules haven't changed and this was the
original security model by Anderson that

78
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,770
were still living with the day which
clearly does not work and the reference

79
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,979
monitor came along and this is
fundamentally what it is you have a

80
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,160
system requests stop the process
followed some set of rules make a

81
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,910
decision and there were no go decisions
are very binary function this is failed

82
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,570
we notice failed and we're still trying
to live with it so I wrote a book way

83
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,540
back when I'm base security trying to
introduce some new concepts so in the

84
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:01,140
physical world is this involves secure
anybody is it secure your going yeah

85
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:10,560
maybe maybe maybe that's not a yet is it
secure why not why it's open perfectly

86
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,669
good binary answer in the physical world
we have something that we do not have in

87
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:22,710
the virtual world we have a system of
knowing exactly how secure is and it's

88
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:30,409
called rating we loved ones apparently
and gun safes are measured in terms of

89
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,810
time and temperature as the how long it
takes to break into it though is one

90
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,010
hour at 3200 degrees Celsius dependence
on the quality of the man

91
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,610
manufacturing but we have a fundamental
understanding in the physical world of

92
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,690
where our weaknesses are and what sort
of physical power takes in order to

93
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,120
break through in this case these
particular defenses this firewall how

94
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:09,290
secure is it one thank you this is the
approach the worth taking because we

95
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,219
bypassing everything we do not the bad
guys do not go after the strongest

96
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,740
portion of our network may go up to the
weakest portions or ad networks and

97
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,850
that's why so much of what we do
actually ends up looking like this

98
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,900
ultimately how many of you have had a
vendor guarantee your product that their

99
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:38,730
firewall to guarantee that the fire was
gonna be good forever microsoft said

100
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,950
something about when does oh boy yeah we
don't guarantee our products we don't

101
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,920
live there are no bender guarantees
anymore so the question becomes why have

102
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,550
we spent two trillion dollars in the
lacs 30 some years of information

103
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:07,219
security on products and services that
we cannot define that we do not know how

104
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,040
strong how resilient they really are
given just a death which is where we've

105
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,939
been for all of these years but what can
we actually measure we can't measure

106
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:27,910
protection we have no mechanism to day
to validate quantify how strong the

107
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,790
firewall is a password mechanism is any
security protective device can we

108
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,750
measure it right now the answer was no
but what

109
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,080
can we measure inside of our networks we
can measure of two things we all have

110
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,380
some level of detection or networks
whether it's a sim or an idea for a

111
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,550
nadie doesn't matter we have the ability
to measure certain levels of activity in

112
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:02,430
our networks it is cold detection have
any of you ever measured in your

113
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:12,370
networks how long and how effective your
detection mechanisms are anybody why not

114
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,350
there is a quantifier there in the
quantifier the second thing we can

115
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,350
measure in our networks his reaction
inside text something whether it's a bad

116
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:31,410
piece of malware or bad I knocked on my
door whatever happens to be I should be

117
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,520
able to measure how long it takes to be
even notice that somebody's knocking at

118
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,610
my door and then for me to take an
appropriate reaction how long does it

119
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,610
take in the visible world as an alarm
system and the cops are human we all see

120
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,390
it in the movies this somebody there
with a clock seven seconds twenty

121
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,339
seconds we have 70 seconds

122
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,720
let's get out of here before the cops
show up because the bad guys didn't

123
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,050
measure detection and reaction

124
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,959
how many have you have ever measured the
detection and reaction systems inside of

125
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:14,240
your networks on the basis of time
anybody you have what we're gonna talk

126
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,250
later I wanna learn more about you must
be a spook you spook ex-military ok so

127
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,500
you know where is this coming from

128
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,210
listen Bob Ayers work way back when in
the nineties

129
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:35,030
we can measure this but we're typically
not doing it in our world in the cold

130
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,170
war exactly what we did we could detect
potential soviet missile launch within

131
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,410
milliseconds then we had eighteen and a
half minutes to determine if we were

132
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,180
going to end the world or not

133
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,930
detection reaction

134
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,709
thermonuclear destruction exactly the
same world we're living in today except

135
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,350
we're not doing it with the same kind of
viable that we had in the past and

136
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,130
ultimately this gives us a formula I
told you to be some math so I'm not

137
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,880
going to bore the crap out of you if
week do not know how strong our

138
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,130
protection is there's a pane of glass is
a million dollars I'm there is a pane of

139
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,820
glass there is that provide protection
against somebody stealing that stuff I'm

140
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,010
not really it's crucial I would say
security theater show but we can measure

141
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,310
is the defection time for the

142
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,250
the paper breaking whatever the
detection we have is ample time for the

143
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,029
cops show up what this gives us is a
fundamental formula and that formula

144
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:52,540
says it I know and I can measure how
strong that classes and how much it will

145
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,870
defend it over a period of time against
an attack that amount of time greater

146
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:07,700
than the amount of time it takes to
detect and react to that particular

147
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,750
attack I've been some say I have a
secure condition very very critical to

148
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,970
understand this detention reaction we
can measure we cannot measure protection

149
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,000
in the current way we do things but this
formula is gonna hold and it's about a

150
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,810
min max condition it's back to my old
analog days how far can I crank the

151
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:41,109
knobs how big this case is Mike time
window of vulnerability which then leads

152
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,260
to be able to talk to the risk people
about what is the risk in my environment

153
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,839
based upon the only metric that is
potentially available to us which is

154
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:58,770
time in this particular case the when we
look at PVR tech detect react

155
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,410
nuclear compliance surveillance
technologies

156
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,490
this is something that we do on a
regular

157
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,740
basis with in the physical world why
aren't we applying this in the virtual

158
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,450
world and for the life of me I do not
understand why we have not any robberies

159
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:25,510
any sort of physical crimes use by its
very nature protect the tech we act as

160
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:32,279
the fundamental formula in order to
measure risk how much how many of the

161
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:39,730
jewels in the bad guys get in 1 minute
10 minutes which leaves us then to

162
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:47,890
figuring out exposure time his exposure
time we talked about apt and the apt is

163
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:54,649
the bad guys have been in my network for
436 days how much damage they do how

164
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:03,270
much data exfiltration can occur in 436
days does anybody know the answer is a

165
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:12,120
whole ship but we don't look at it this
way in terms of exposure because

166
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,529
ultimately the exposure time that you
have in your network regardless of your

167
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,760
protective technology is two day purely
based upon your ability to detect and

168
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:33,529
the ability to react to some potential
proceed or detected there is nothing

169
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,740
else that we have some given we can look
at this and these all become very simple

170
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,839
limits very simple calculus to be able
to figure out what is the limits and the

171
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,130
min-max limits in this case early two
numbers one of them is zero and the

172
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,899
other is infinity everything else

173
00:16:52,899 --> 00:17:00,160
sits in between and part of our job
under this schema is to compress that

174
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:09,579
detection reaction time as much as we
possibly can so the concept now today is

175
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,990
defense in debt

176
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:19,439
again be picture yesterday about castle
the wall in the oil and the bad at all

177
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,040
that we have all of these layers of
defense house defense in depth working

178
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:31,790
for us I don't hear any resounding
alright defense in depth doesn't work

179
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:38,710
because the bad guys what do they do it
why did go through the thick walt would

180
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,750
you go around and go through the human
and we've had a lot of questions about

181
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,260
this as well so yes defensive depth can
work you can layer it usually same type

182
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,360
approaches and formulas by detecting and
reacting to your detection reaction

183
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,990
mechanisms but also believe this is not
going to give us what we need the first

184
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,230
thing I want to approach with the
thinking is how do we kill wilt I hate

185
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,500
group we've had in our systems since day
one when we first turned on the first

186
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,880
password on the first mainframe computer
fifty years ago

187
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,420
is also the root of all evil when we're
dealing with our networks because that's

188
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:26,559
what privilege escalation is about
gaining access to the cool stuff so the

189
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,730
first thing we gotta do is understand a
little bit of Boolean logic everybody

190
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,440
good with Boolean logic I don't need to
go through it

191
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,260
yes these are the fundamental going to
deal with not and and OR gates

192
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,929
ultimately when we do this together and
I show you how to make this all work so

193
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:49,330
the other pieces were going to use a
little bit but not so much today I would

194
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:57,928
you trust your significant other with
your life so if your wife only one guy

195
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,710
in the whole rooms as this

196
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,529
if your wife had a choice between your
children and you would you give me the

197
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:11,720
same answer you would though she put the
kids before you know she'd kill you

198
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:20,500
before the kids the kids first so it's
not a binary function it cannot function

199
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,880
but in the real world we occasionally
run into this you have two people sign a

200
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,320
check in some wire transfer and
financial transactions you have to be

201
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,580
able to have a dual authentication we
call this binary trust and ultimately

202
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,889
it's again it's a simple function very
simple function of trying to limit the

203
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,559
amount of time it takes for an
authorization to occur however what

204
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,250
happens in this case is the thing that
we don't know don't use very much and we

205
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,320
talked about it yesterday was the
concept of trust is trust a binary

206
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:09,918
function or is it a mammal we have
trusted insiders a binary function we

207
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,470
have trusted executives a binary
function whereas the weighting factor in

208
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:21,380
order to be able to judge what is the
level of trust what is the trust factor

209
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,760
and there's different ways of looking at
it and in this case I just gave a couple

210
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,779
of fast examples based upon different
criteria in this particular case with

211
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,820
the weighting factors we wanted
something that's really really really

212
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,250
super super geeky to be able to do stuff
and then another case somebody who's

213
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,630
less geeky who had a better background
and had a better history it ends up

214
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,860
giving this eight different answer and
those are arbitrary they work within an

215
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,229
organization don't try to compare trust
factors of company a company be it's not

216
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,390
gonna work it needs to be something that
a self-consistent within his own

217
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,220
organization could be just for the
engineering department this for the

218
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:08,020
sales department fair enough but right
now we're looking at 10 when it comes to

219
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,120
human trust versus how much

220
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,000
really trust this person has become very
important because in the real world we

221
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,430
don't have one administrator in route
control doing we have multiple

222
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,190
administrators out of the physical
necessity to be able to have coverage

223
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,530
hundred and sixty eight hours a week so
therefore route control is distributed

224
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,170
and it is distributed amongst a number
of people and when we look at this

225
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:45,309
probabilistic only been really really
interesting happens because they are

226
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,170
independent variables we have to
multiply the numbers together and

227
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,290
suddenly up I have two guys with a trust
factor of point nine each

228
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,820
they both have root access and maybe
ones from eight to five guys from five

229
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,480
to midnight suddenly what have I trust
factor overall control path

230
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,370
wave hill down when I'm dealing with 45
46 47 administrators inside of the

231
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,370
environment all we're doing here is
working on a probabilistic formula say

232
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,760
holy crap no wonder stuff is going wrong

233
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,879
proves why were having so many problems
at will

234
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,820
controls so this is the first problem I
started to look at in terms of how do I

235
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,700
take the digital world to make it
amalgam come up with some ideas that may

236
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:43,090
work so what we do is against all
totally probably stick and it ends up

237
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,530
being common sense

238
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:54,190
ultimate level of trust fact that you
have in a rout control situation is

239
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,980
lower than your weakest link it's not
your weakest link is the weakest link

240
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,440
your weakest link your security and
trust factor is lower than your weakest

241
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,350
link and this is purely probabilistic
math nothing complicated about law and

242
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,600
you can learn all the stuff on wiki and
there's just varies nomenclature for how

243
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,080
to do this but in this case keep in mind
these are mutually exclusive advanced

244
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,750
body a body be no

245
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,700
each one has independent control
therefore we have to look at it with

246
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,420
this kind of probabilistic formula so
how do we solve it

247
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,250
we go to a call to to Mr and we go back
to the two men rule this solves

248
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,170
everything right gotta have two people
do it right you're really gonna agree

249
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,920
with me on this you know better than I
don't agree with me so fast

250
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,600
this is the way we do it in many cases
but what happens is something very

251
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,300
interesting that having an OR gate and
applying a probabilistic that way we end

252
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,010
up with it and gates and we both got i
eight and guy be to agree to a

253
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:14,040
particular decision and action and now
keep in mind this can be a human it can

254
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,879
be done with the code level it can be at
the network level it doesn't matter

255
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,290
user just merely object subject
relationships and I'm talking about you

256
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:29,409
but what happens when I put in an AND
gate and require the two men rule we end

257
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,060
up with a different probabilistic
formula and my security goes off

258
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,240
measurably very very significantly which
is very cool however what is the problem

259
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,610
with this anybody know what the problem
of this model your military you know the

260
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:51,159
answer already on the military more area
as well as your job you don't know the

261
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,920
answer

262
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:06,720
oK what's the problem with this one word
in Orchha not quite almost time I get

263
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,930
guys to do something I gotta wait for
guideby to finally get around to make a

264
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,760
decision and agree or disagree with it
and are hyper speed environment these

265
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:24,100
days I'm not gonna be done in 20 minutes
so you better get over it I have to wait

266
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,020
and today's world at all so we're going
to take another approach and now we're

267
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:36,429
gonna go to the military which are very
ok you know

268
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,690
that means anybody know what it is

269
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:47,159
was developed by very very smart guy
John Boyd back in the eighties and it's

270
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:55,230
called observed or in the side impact
and the circle and the reason he came up

271
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,590
with it was in order to be able to make
fighter pilots understand our

272
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:07,408
environment that they had to go through
this cycle on a continuous basis and

273
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:14,240
that increase survivability likelihood
of success in air combat and the same

274
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,960
thing works in marketing I got an idea
I'm gonna test marketed to build and

275
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,919
sell some of the sea with the market
says now modify it and do it all over

276
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:31,149
again it's an iterative analog process
not a digital process so what I like to

277
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:37,860
do again is apply if a limit to this can
I ever in the new dilute weather with

278
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,629
war-fighting marketing decision making
and networks can I ever reach zero time

279
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:48,990
no of course so I have functional limits
and bandwidth and constrictions that are

280
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,490
naturally part of the environment but I
need to consider when we're looking at

281
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,559
what I called loop and this is the issue
that we call in our world granularity

282
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,668
and the granularity could be the quality
of the audio based upon the compression

283
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:10,499
algorithms or in this case it's a purely
a log of squeezing trying to make the

284
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:21,529
little loop as granular and its small as
I possibly can take that and then we

285
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:26,309
look at the real world we have some
blips in the observed area we have lost

286
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,480
a little tough areas I'm going to
observe this woman who deserve this

287
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,769
to observe this have different tastes
based upon my kicked action observation

288
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:41,779
and detection are the same type of
function but I treated from an analog

289
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,100
standpoint I'm gonna have all these
little process is going on in

290
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:53,949
software will call them separate please
view it and ultimately what we do is we

291
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,870
can apply fractal mathematics of mental
brought sets to this and start examining

292
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:05,250
how deep the granularity is of my
observation and light detection systems

293
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:12,410
it's all about the detention nothing
else at this point so now we're going to

294
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:21,320
go into the most critical area I grew up
in analog engineer

295
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:31,090
real-world this device anybody know what
it is about the governor it keeps steam

296
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:38,939
engines from running too fast we heard
it yesterday if the ladies talk feedback

297
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,960
caused by the microphone and the speaker
having with gold positive feedback and

298
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,070
down here is an electrical circuit what
feedback is one thing and one thing only

299
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:56,330
as a mechanism to control and stabilize
a network that network doesn't have to

300
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,658
be a digital network it could be a
conceptual networking acoustic

301
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:06,039
networking could be a physical network
and so we have enough action here the

302
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:13,450
tells exactly how mathematically to
define our feedback the whole point is

303
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:20,679
every engineering discipline in the
world with the exception of information

304
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:31,049
security employees feedback why why
we're still naive believing that we've

305
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:39,940
got this binary function I'm secure I'm
not secure and that's what the risk guys

306
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,919
that shows that these guys or what I
hear they don't want to know about the

307
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,760
feedback mechanisms to be able to
actually control them we have it in our

308
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,379
lives

309
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,429
things you touch the key anybody ever
have those keyboards and it doesn't give

310
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:58,000
you anything back at us like this
keyboard right

311
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,790
you want to have some feedback so you
know what's going on you want to be able

312
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:09,659
to spell it's about sensory input to us
as human beings but we're not doing this

313
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,910
in our networks even though the networks
are tied to humans and technology 0

314
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,960
feedback mechanisms built into our
networks and designs today calling for

315
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,240
you guys from the Dutch lands up there
they survive their country

316
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,400
survives because of the Delta works and
it's a feedback mechanism in order to

317
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,030
keep the North Sea from inundating their
entire country started building in the

318
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:41,210
fifties and it works amazingly well any
feedback mechanism is designed to

319
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:48,230
prevent chaos from ensuing so how do we
apply this will just take a real example

320
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,070
we're gonna have some process request
again as a human requested the digital

321
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,280
request doesn't matter what I'm going to
do is begin this process but most of the

322
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,700
Duke has become o'clock I'm gonna start
a clock and we're going to arbitrarily

323
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:11,780
say for example that I want to have that
particular process approved Alice makes

324
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:19,480
the decision but I want bob to approve
it within one second one minute one hour

325
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:28,040
of policy policy decision based upon the
trust factor of Alice and Bob and back

326
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,100
to our probabilistic numbers that we had
earlier and with using those numbers I

327
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,719
now have quantifiable numbers based upon
the exposure time data showed you

328
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,600
earlier

329
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,679
becomes the exposure during that
feedback loop that weird that we would

330
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,790
have here in this case is being a simple
abstraction of it but when I apply to

331
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:56,889
feedback loop I now have a very very
specific level of trust factor defined

332
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:03,350
over a period of time which tells me
what my risk is my risk then as a

333
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,998
function of time and cost factor both of
which are am alone

334
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:14,069
muted 12 Jul so we can do the things you
can do it with enforcing two men rule

335
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:21,408
very very simply we can do with ima
mechanisms same approach to it they're

336
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:25,279
all fundamentally the same and
occasionally you may run across this one

337
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,369
year on mobile banking and it says all
this is a new device please go check

338
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:34,839
back device over there and make sure the
new validate the code and come back and

339
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,479
you have X amount of time to do it
exactly the same process so we're seeing

340
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:44,809
a couple of these in the real world
especially in the mobile now in the

341
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,759
time-based weapons mod we go back to the
reference model to work from Anderson

342
00:32:48,759 --> 00:33:00,389
back in 72 and say what we do is we have
a system request cause process instead

343
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:05,809
of stop process we want to pause process
because if we have properly designed our

344
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:11,229
network and/or detection reaction system
we know how long it takes how long does

345
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:15,019
it take the middle of a particular piece
of code is bad or not based upon a

346
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:19,139
lookup table you know the answer is
better than I do is one second hundred

347
00:33:19,139 --> 00:33:25,899
milliseconds whatever happens to be the
lookup tables are based upon time go

348
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:31,908
no-go decision is made based upon that
but what happens as a result is by

349
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:39,209
adding the pause I reduced the amount of
risk that I've got his I'm not allowing

350
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:42,549
that particular action to current
monetary the formula for this in a

351
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:47,759
couple of minutes so now we're gonna go
down to little more feedback does

352
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:57,260
anybody know what this is anybody what
this is

353
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:04,840
call the IRS flip-flop it's a feedback
mechanism that is the fundamental of

354
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,560
everything we do in the world that is a
bit about Murray in digital logic

355
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,179
representation so basically what happens
is if I set are you will go high by set

356
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,030
as you will go alone

357
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,909
primal go high as merely a bit flipping

358
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:28,950
remembering all that is and there are
corresponding truth tables to that the

359
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:33,710
tell us exactly how the system works
this is the digital representation of

360
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,929
how we do things but now what we
designed this served in a little bit and

361
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:46,970
add clock clock in to YouTube behavior
be input doesn't matter of the SLR input

362
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:57,529
and what we do is merely say unless an
approval is within X period of time

363
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:09,680
determined by policy we revoke prior
decision very simple unless the approval

364
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,290
of a particular action at the code level
of the human level of the GTG level

365
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,920
doesn't matter

366
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,850
occurs within a very specific policy set
up time we've both that decision that

367
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,500
now because I'm in the detection
reaction world I know exactly how long

368
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:34,720
my beliefs your time and I can then
translate that into risk you are

369
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,759
corresponding truth tables that we've
been able to develop out abusing him

370
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,780
analog feedback and will be call it I'm
base to end gate or time-based depending

371
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,660
upon which terminology you're more
comfortable with so I didn't want you

372
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,259
knew this was something that we figure
it out

373
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,320
forty years ago and the circuitry is
very very similar

374
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,960
well we have these two guys are willing
to blow up the world

375
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,619
them silo in North Dakota they have
independent clocks and either one of

376
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:15,920
them can initiate the launch the news
however the tears some people say all

377
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,300
they have to do it at the same time

378
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,880
know they have to do it within a
particular window of time in that window

379
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,930
of time is typically less than two
seconds they both have to flip back key

380
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:32,430
and this is exactly the same circuitry
that we have never apply to information

381
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:40,680
security to get agreement based upon
time on what your policy and your your

382
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,720
vindication of any of the attributes of
your gonna have for any security at all

383
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,790
we've had this in the physical world for
more than fifty years we have not done

384
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:58,230
it in our world so that the last piece
of this is gonna be going out of men and

385
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,470
in my old world when we started doing
automation in the audio world we used to

386
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:10,618
have the same thing the TCP IP does I
got one wire that has data and control

387
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:17,030
signals that's cool right in our world
we had an audio signal in the middle of

388
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,030
the audio signal had a bottom controller
an equaliser we could adjust the signal

389
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,890
Along Came automate office which meant
that we needed it out of band control

390
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:32,720
signal to be able to control the actual
signal flow itself the cool part about

391
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:42,009
that meant that if I lose my control
path the signal remains where it was it

392
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:49,089
doesn't go away and not disappearing it
remains where it was prior set like

393
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:57,150
members do with with with memory right
now so in our world we got all of this

394
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:05,800
stuff on one wire cut that one wire your
shit outta la it all goes away we don't

395
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,740
have an out of band condition so this is

396
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,490
bought a detection reaction module with
where we have monitoring and that at

397
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:20,020
some level of protection doesn't matter
what it is again I don't care if its

398
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,330
human behavior this is a pure
abstraction we have reaction make fixes

399
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,730
to make decisions as to what should
happen which is called prev thinking out

400
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,960
your world

401
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,980
analyzing somebody mentioned yesterday
what could go wrong how many how much

402
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,550
thought has gone into what could
actually go wrong to have some sort of

403
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,090
preparation when those things do go
wrong and then you're gonna have

404
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:50,730
reaction I reaction channel decision
will be made based upon time because

405
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,780
it's all clocked entirely and then
you're going to enforce that reaction

406
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,630
and then enforcing that reaction could
be turned it off turn it on all the

407
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,890
administrator doesn't matter is a pure
theoretical abstraction of how to

408
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:11,839
control a network flow and
vulnerabilities based upon time so

409
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,660
you've got obviously have some idea of
what you want to do and this requires

410
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,129
thinking absolutely but for those
organizations that instantly have a

411
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,540
problem and called the FBI or their
lawyers you guys are idiots it's like

412
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:30,609
long you gotta have some idea of what
you're trying to do when the shit hits

413
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:36,430
the fan so a simple reaction may produce
just having in this case a bunch of

414
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,720
perimeter stuff going on I got a bad day
knocking on my door very very simple now

415
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,700
I can also complicated further by having
multiple reaction made some on an

416
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,330
internal basis without a ban security
and some going on perimeter and they can

417
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,730
talk to each other again it doesn't
really matter because the obstruction of

418
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,950
the reaction matrix sitting at the
detection points in the net worth and

419
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:06,600
having a reaction feeding back into it
out of band mechanism does not interfere

420
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:14,190
at all with the primary functioning of
the debt work completely separate so I

421
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:19,599
don't have to redesign tcp/ip to make
any of this work

422
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:29,130
this is a 777 engine reason the pictures
here inside this engine there are 5,000

423
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:38,910
detection points out that are monitored
and updated every single second to

424
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:52,319
optimize performance about our networks
this is GE and Siemens are the two

425
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,869
companies that are leading in the ICS
industrial control system world

426
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:03,349
providing feedback into systems to be
able to create stability measurement and

427
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:12,739
true control the object is my mind not
defense in depth it is detection in how

428
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:18,640
many places in your networks should you
be looking for something going wrong one

429
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,759
place to places and places a thousand
places at every bit as every decision

430
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:30,099
point doesn't matter because ultimately
it's a matter of policy and the level of

431
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,749
depth of security that you're trying to
achieve and ultimately the numbers will

432
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:41,118
fall out as a function of time but its
de- tection in depth is where the

433
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,950
cinders industry has completely fail
we're not looking at what we're doing

434
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:53,359
we're looking at the input we're looking
at the output and we're not looking at

435
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,019
anything in the middle which from an
engineering standpoint is a recipe for

436
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:01,959
disaster so one of the things we can do
with this approach is actually solve the

437
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,400
Nile service may be kind of cool
wouldn't it and all we doing basically

438
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,729
is having I would have been occasions
occurring assuming that in the deal West

439
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:16,739
attack or DDoS attack of any sort by
primary communication control channel

440
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,349
are gonna be fault because that's what
the bad guys want they want them to have

441
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,480
a business so one wire BAM there now but
if I put

442
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:34,830
this all the way around on imagine every
tier 1 tier 2 and tier 3 ISP in the

443
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:43,009
world had back channel communication all
it does is say I am detecting this and

444
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:50,260
I'm detecting bad traffic from this IP
address and I communicate down to the

445
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,540
next hop where that traffic is coming
from cuz I know where it is my primary

446
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,090
channel is already full so I have to go
out of Pan Am I can tell the next-hop

447
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:04,880
stop this than that hop will know where
its traffic is coming from what was

448
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,490
distributed or not and we have a
complete back channel communication

449
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,890
system going on outside of tcp/ip
without having to modify it either in

450
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,700
order to be able to allow us to read the
same thing will work for spam as well

451
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:25,319
and ultimately what we're looking at is
our primary network is up their standard

452
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,130
that work that's everything we live with
today and I'm suggesting that if we had

453
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:37,910
detection reaction model not a lot of
code detection reaction module and this

454
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,040
case at the network level it could be at
the code level as well I want to know

455
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,240
what's going on when it going on and
have a backplane of communication to

456
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:54,529
tell me what is my network actually
doing in real time plus or minus a few

457
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:59,430
clock cycles and this is the model that
we've been working with the last couple

458
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:08,230
years to try to get this bill which is a
new protocol out of band communication

459
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:14,380
for detection reaction matrixes so that
we have a completely separate policy

460
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:20,170
driven set of rules outside of my
primary stack and communication channel

461
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,890
that are still able to out of band
control what's going on so what are the

462
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,680
things that we can do here is start
looking at where my targets and against

463
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:37,750
simple math everything is about time
file size is time bandwidth is time

464
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,210
everything in our networks is about time
we ignore it always been we care about

465
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:48,610
it doesn't work does not work again this
is very very simple so what can I do

466
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,920
with this particular case I don't like a
dweeb the colon my world

467
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,350
compressor something Bad's going on but
worried about data exfiltration perhaps

468
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:03,000
why don't we had what we would call an
attenuator or volume control and it ends

469
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,020
up constricting data why not just slow
today to why do I have to stop the data

470
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,620
do I need to have a binary condition of
all times when something goes wrong and

471
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:20,589
I argue that there are variables in the
middle and it's a very very simple

472
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:27,390
bandwidth construction module that can
go into any pathway at all of hers but

473
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:34,720
you can end up with orders of magnitude
of improvement in measurable security if

474
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,049
you have a detection reaction matrix and
one of your modules in-line modules is

475
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:45,300
actually a compressor now we're gonna
really screw up here we're gonna do

476
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,320
something called negative time going
back to my old world we had audio

477
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:58,770
anybody remember what's up on a member
whole lotta love and the voice in that

478
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,070
it was actually at all that we did that
by having a tape machine over there and

479
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,550
take the shine over there

480
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:09,660
stringing a piece of magnetic tape to
and adjusting the distance between the

481
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,259
machines in order to create those delays
that was the technology of the day in

482
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,510
the late sixties it ultimately became
called a digital delay line and a

483
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,800
digital delay line is nothing more than
a delay of a digital component over a

484
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,630
period of time again so what I want to
do is add negative time into some that

485
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:37,000
work and why do I want to do this
because it gives me mathematically

486
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:46,240
provable security improves security by
taking this approach and ultimately if

487
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,160
we know our defection time

488
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,480
and we know our reaction time we know
that protection is indeterminate we

489
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,260
can't prove that given the existing
technology but I had negative time in to

490
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,950
the dataflow what ends up happening it
ends up I end up with a mathematically

491
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:12,189
provable formula that says that that
particular component of my network is

492
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:18,829
map but medically provably secure I know
I'm going through this really really

493
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:23,700
quickly is normally four hours here's
one example of how to do it in the data

494
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,098
compression mechanism defection reaction
we've got a reaction master control

495
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:33,849
course and this particular case
something goes wrong data compression in

496
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:38,890
this case three orders of magnitude fair
enough we can apply this same approach

497
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:46,750
with negative time as well and in this
case I V stop fishing this is the model

498
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:53,359
on how to stop fishing using this
approach and we have the technology we

499
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,549
understand enough of the mathematics now
to be able to actually make this work

500
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:05,319
oddly enough and I did not notice until
a couple of months ago for those of you

501
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:09,849
that are familiar with load balancing
and cooling the formulas are virtually

502
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:15,079
identical and I didn't know that was
like oh wow that's kind of cool sounds

503
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:23,230
of the approach is the same and it's
looking at min-max condition with time

504
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,010
as being the fundamental metric for all
measurements throughout so what else

505
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:34,160
getting network network security do for
you I don't know all the answers at all

506
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,578
I know some of the things that I've
found lots of cool things that have

507
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:43,240
appeared and shown up that would be
really cool if I could do this and do

508
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,419
this and this is why hopefully we'll get
the industry to start looking at some of

509
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,460
the things that we can do these are the
tenets that I live and one of the things

510
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,789
I suggest you when every you have a
discussion about security with anybody

511
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:01,060
with your asking the question or
answering the question

512
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:09,120
make sure that a time component part of
your question to the answer if you do

513
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,640
not invoke time you're going to fail
because you're looking for a binary

514
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,670
answer analog answer because there is no
such thing as a zero or a one when it

515
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:28,040
comes to security it's always something
in between so used time every discussion

516
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,900
you've got I got a new book coming up
please buy it thank you very much and i

517
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,210
know i went over four minutes you guys
have been awesome and I know this was a

518
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:40,440
four hour thing and I had to do it
really really fast I'll be here for the

519
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,100
whole day if anybody wants to sit down
and start drilling with and with the map

520
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,420
and i'll show you how it all worked
thank you very much appreciate it
