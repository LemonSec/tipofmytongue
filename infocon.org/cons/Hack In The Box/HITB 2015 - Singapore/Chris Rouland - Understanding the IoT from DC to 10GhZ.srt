1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:26,890
great talks afternoon so really enjoyed
the zero day in the router really

2
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,840
enjoyed the ICS talk and really enjoyed
their day talk my background I really

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,080
worked in three places that work for a
company called internet security systems

4
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,620
were built one of the first woman
billionaire Billy research teams called

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:45,030
the x-force to actually still in
existence today and how it poured by IBM

6
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,140
is kind of one of their anchors of their
security business subsequent to that

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,450
effect the company about the company in
my basement cold and game systems so

8
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,050
that was made myself and two other guys
and we go up to about 250 people and

9
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:08,090
it's doing well today and I took some
time off the phone to explore something

10
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:18,530
else that I'm passionate about which I
see more and more a larger intersection

11
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,100
up today which is exciting for me which
is radio frequency hacking and computer

12
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,520
hacking and so I'm an amateur radio
operator and consider myself a computer

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:39,048
hacker my first computer I broke into
his in 1984 using an IBM 5150

14
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:46,210
and this was my first laptop which was
used thermal printing paper which I but

15
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,309
when I was 13 years old so I've been
into this and passion about it for quite

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,880
a long time and I always was always
interested in exploring radio spectrum

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,420
as well and so we're in this really
unique position today with the Internet

18
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,030
of Things and I think there's a giant
security gap being missed with the

19
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,900
wireless exposure that we see or don't
see today with the massive amount of

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,890
matters that are just simple tree in our
inner space so I'm building a couple

21
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,869
months in a pinch my company but you
know what we're looking at the numbers

22
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,080
from Cisco gardener or about fifty
billion devices connected to the

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,360
Internet of Things by 2020 if you
compare that to the growth of the human

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,030
population there are 300,000 new human
births per day versus fifty million

25
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:48,230
computers attached to the network every
day so if you want to start talking

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,069
about when machine intelligence exceeds
human intelligence it's something I

27
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,839
think reason you know

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,930
reasonable start thinking about but i
wanna get to sci-fi so as one of the

29
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,980
older guys here I am at the moment and
can't go through how I think we are

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:14,530
repeating a bit of history I loved the
quote and will be from the router the

31
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:23,290
router today senator but it's under bugs
back the nineties because it's really

32
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,000
the situation that we're in and
especially when you look at the at the

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,599
wireless exposure side and no se some
toys and tools and things that were

34
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,238
using to hack wireless today so this is
Chris ruins history of information

35
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,940
security so in the nineteen seventies we
saw Captain Crunch discover with a with

36
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,290
a whistle he could take over telephone
systems make long distance calls this

37
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,340
was really an enabler actually enabler
for guys like me because calling long

38
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,470
distance was really expensive if you and
what if you wanna down the computer mom

39
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,470
got really mad with power and our phone
bill so we had to figure out a columnist

40
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,060
for free so phone freaking was really an
enabler to hackers organizing and

41
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,379
getting together with IBM bulletin
boards weather before X 25 networks was

42
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:20,089
also really one computer hacking became
illegal states it wasn't until 1988 with

43
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,479
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act we saw
the first really too

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,370
we saw one for profit computer crime
which was Kevin Poulsen kevin's now very

45
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:43,170
famous journalist his crime was gaming a
radio station calling system back then

46
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,720
the radio stations would have a call and
if you're calling him one hundred and

47
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,090
one you win a prize in this case there
was a radio station to give up Porsche's

48
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,440
when were the right color number and so
he happened to win a couple of course is

49
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,530
that someone caught off guard on it
perhaps he was game the system and he

50
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:07,119
lost his Porsche 944 a sand and a little
time but honestly my my my personal

51
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,610
opinion as I think that's a bit of a
victim of crime they're giving away the

52
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,570
car randomly anyway and then Robert
Morris with the Morris worm obviously it

53
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,080
was kind of the first really kind of
cataclysmic impact we saw on the

54
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,840
internet that made people start thinking
about security I think we didn't really

55
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,820
feel that impact again until the Melissa
virus hit later on michelangelo's much

56
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,469
different than michelangelo we began to
see remote exploitation now in the

57
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:48,260
nineteen nineties and the key enabler to
remote exploitation was a technology

58
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll go through shortly bubbas basically
packet sniffing I'll go into some depth

59
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,170
and how that applies to where we are
with current technology and radio

60
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,630
spectrum on how it puts us right back
and swear and I think about 1994 me in

61
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,460
my opinion which i think is a great
opportunity for the community to create

62
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,060
a bunch of new technologies but
exploitative and defensive I love both

63
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,320
sides of the equation

64
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,040
thousands we started to see big tax big
attacks but really it was it was certain

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,960
to be the early commercialization of
computer fraud we saw you know big

66
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,729
events like sequel slammer could read
attacks on social media like MySpace and

67
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,580
going into the smartphone

68
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,810
today really you know what are called
cyber war but we've got much more

69
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,009
serious cyber physical attacks going on
which were extremely well described

70
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,729
afternoon and and really the the
commercialization of the criminal

71
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:58,258
activity on the internet much more
malicious and in some cases existential

72
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:04,159
per for companies were companies can
truly go out of business now in 2015 if

73
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:12,740
there's if there if there if they're
badly compromised by 2020 ICS in a place

74
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,440
where I was completely taken over our
devices or I really makes the

75
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,389
terminators with devices I really seeing
I want to you I don't see it as a broad

76
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,819
marketing term for m2m ICS really
anything that's connected and mostly

77
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:36,860
connected without Ethernet or without
and without wifi so going back old

78
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,319
school again you know this was what the
internet will look like in in in the

79
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,830
nineties it was ugly imagine a world
where IPX SPX one right we would be

80
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,599
iight I don't know I will probably like
the planet will be different but tcp/ip

81
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,389
hadn't won but back in those days you
had to know all these networks I met you

82
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,759
know it's really kind white-haired talk
but you know I remember connecting

83
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,050
AppleTalk network this email and Nobel
and trying to print through it was a

84
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:17,520
complete nightmare and I have go for up
here I'm somewhat go for D because I

85
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,370
deployed some of the very early internet
sites including senate dot gov and when

86
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,099
I was told Senate doc go I said you on a
web server they said no we just want to

87
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,330
go for server those this web thing here
is you really want to try and senator

88
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:38,289
kennedy was for looking ahead and put up
a web server on my car so that was one

89
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,990
of the first web servers

90
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:48,149
young anyway so we were finding our way
across different protocols fortunately

91
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,540
this 11 but if you look at the IOT today
we're we're in a much different

92
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,069
situation much worse situation than we
were twenty years ago but i wanna go

93
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:08,649
back to why in the mid-nineties we saw a
revolution in exploitation someone my

94
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,850
company found this much broader picture
of me probably when I was using one of

95
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,399
these and so early in my career

96
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:25,010
15 packets was like magic right was it
was like only a few people had access to

97
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,149
the snapper and and they were extremely
expensive and all it was was a compact

98
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:37,100
lunch box computer with a special
network interface card from coming home

99
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,270
network general which later became a
copy and it really shows that the guys

100
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,790
who made the slipper became one of the
biggest cyber security companies it is

101
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,339
is that be able to see traffic and seed
seed packets on the network are

102
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:58,600
absolutely critical to to having
visibility into that and and two things

103
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,649
changed in the mid-nineties one is
fortunately pools open source tools and

104
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,140
some sort of shipping things like Snoop
tcpdump was really a game-changer we had

105
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:15,319
some really good early promiscuous mode
device drivers for OpenBSD FreeBSD

106
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,360
platforms and so everyone got to see its
network traffic not just people could

107
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,399
afford $25,000 shippers and once
everyone could see that network traffic

108
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,160
then we get we start to begin to reverse
engineer in to cut those protocols and

109
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,689
as we discuss protocols we found all
kinds of vulnerabilities so the nineties

110
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:40,120
was just the heyday of funding and 0
days just as you're you're you're you're

111
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,529
you're talking with with with RT devices
on the IP side with the network card let

112
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,350
alone when you get looking at

113
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,270
at at this next generation of over a
hundred different worlds protocols that

114
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:01,720
are that are that are all developed
without eyes on them and so so that

115
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,510
really gave birth to the access this ban
port the ability to sniff packets gave

116
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,750
birth to the modern cyber security
industry you look at any billion dollar

117
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,860
cyber security company today almost all
of them have one thing in common they

118
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,430
need access to the spam port and so my
fetuses to secure the IOT both to find

119
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,839
vulnerabilities in it and to secure it
we're gonna have to be able to see our

120
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,180
airspace and the amount of information
that is going across the spectrum in

121
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:40,239
through the air right now in this room
even I was looking earlier is is just is

122
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,540
just is agreeing and really no one's
been looking at it until recently

123
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:52,469
because the technology to do so was far
more expensive than that so if you look

124
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,220
at where we are now this is just some of
them and these are really small small

125
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,380
artery obviously our bodies way down
here on the spectrum consider that as

126
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,590
part of an AT&T and i've seen

127
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,290
ZigBee z-wave to the pic on quite a bit

128
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:20,439
new protocol that's coming out next next
year is able to 11 H with that so it it

129
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,850
to 11 aah is 900 megahertz I seventy and
long range wifi so imagine now we've got

130
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,890
a new wifi that no one can see that very
long range so it's going to be an

131
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,819
interesting

132
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:44,360
I think we'll see a lot of 11 Ajax in
2016 but this this this threat surface

133
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,160
with all these different physical by
later why protocols as well as the

134
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,329
software protocols on top of them looks
way worse than the slide I showed you

135
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:02,010
with Nobel son and tcp/ip and so what
we've got we've got competing protocols

136
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,310
for the industrial control protocols
consumer protocols and even some voice

137
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,349
that has been picked on for years we
picked on Dec that the last two hot

138
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:20,760
talks at the box office and one of them
was on Dec one of them was just stop

139
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:29,220
replying radios which is the core of our
technology anyway the point is in in

140
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,210
ninety four we had to deal with maybe
ten protocols on the network and fiber

141
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,760
optic fibre

142
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,310
couple actually that someone had this
brilliant idea to submit them based

143
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:52,890
Ethernet did very well it's much worse
today and conversely they give us too

144
00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:01,830
much greater opportunity in the game
changer was was in my opinion was this

145
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,140
guy who he is

146
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:14,280
his name's care for I and i the harness
I've always had a hard time with name

147
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:21,020
recognition sales guys said think of a
name to work so I said Friday now I'll

148
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:29,620
never forget his name pair so therefore
I found this device called RTL 2832

149
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,410
there been several iterations on that
device they have done really small now

150
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,829
this is one right here and it's designed
for DVB TV reception so it's designed

151
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:47,830
for digital video broadcast television
reception this one was about $6

152
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,870
hours and the frequency what he did was
turn it into what's called

153
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,730
software-defined radio or effectively a
packet sniffer for the airways these

154
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,980
you've probably heard in the USPS we've
had quite a bit

155
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:07,800
drama about being spied on by our
government having her cell phones

156
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,560
intercepted randomly road salt hours of
talk about some more depth to basically

157
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,810
these were these this up until a few
years ago this was equipment that was

158
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:29,349
only available to nation states so not
unlike say GPS GPS was deployed in the

159
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,620
nineteen fifties but was really only
available to the consumer until the late

160
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,030
nineties this technology has been used
by multiple government so sure

161
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,510
for decades it will cost of billions of
dollars but all of a sudden a few

162
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:52,920
hackers got together and not only tribe
awesome in with a car F Matt as his

163
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,300
research company called new on these are
kind of the three players in the three

164
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,260
big players in software-defined radio
space which is still somewhat

165
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,630
reminiscent to me of kinda like building
a Heathkit computer or power power

166
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,439
happen Apple to look at it and having a
basic problem there's nothing there and

167
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,090
so I really see stopped replying radios
is the next big thing that has not

168
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:25,910
happened you and so all of a sudden so
that this this one that killed a problem

169
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,430
religious war I think it's a bit of a
toy these are these allow you to do

170
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,479
quite a bit more in the way of transmit
and receive so imagine now the ability

171
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,840
to inject packets through the air wave
at these frequencies obviously in

172
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,350
accordance with state and local
legislation because it's it's it's a lot

173
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:53,090
of different laws where you are in the
world and some places it's not criminal

174
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,560
you just get some to finance the
location the transmitter

175
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,900
you have to be very careful so for
instance of Mike my company I've got

176
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,020
five PHD's and software-defined radios
and we keep a lot of their work in

177
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:07,660
Faraday cages because Wayne United
States it works if you transmit on on a

178
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,740
band too hard to find so you have to be
very careful that when when you are if

179
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:22,410
you do transmits that you do so safely
and legally the couple of examples here

180
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:30,680
of STR hacks this is one of my guys name
is Logan lamb he you know its new trend

181
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:42,330
going back to Cisco gate in 2005 @ black
at Logan lamb researcher works for me

182
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,860
and prior to his work for Oak Ridge
National Labs anyway when he was there

183
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,409
he found very serious serious
vulnerabilities in almost all wireless

184
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,490
home alarm systems in that while they
have the ability to detect jamming they

185
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,470
basically kind of lazy or don't want to
use the battery powered to detect

186
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,190
jamming and it's very simple to jam for
thirty three megahertz 315 megahertz

187
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:17,660
home alarm systems and so he went on
television show very populated states on

188
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,600
the popular TV show Good Morning America
and demonstrated in the back of them how

189
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,060
to bypass alarm system and I walked
right in the front door and this was

190
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,879
right around Christmas and the vendors
got the message because ATT which is one

191
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,920
of the largest alarm companies in the
USA got slapped with a theater class

192
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:48,050
action lawsuit and its it seems to bed
egregious to me but certainly I think

193
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:52,580
we'll get their attention said Wow I'm
in the security business and my sensors

194
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,870
can be jammed with a $6 shipped on
Amazon and hope the nine volt battery

195
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,540
perhaps I need to turn on my
anti-jamming measures this was a great

196
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,600
example shook on a couple years ago
using

197
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,469
one of these radios you SRP where this
guy just went ahead and disregarded the

198
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,480
FCC rights because of you not familiar
with it as a largely us' government

199
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,870
attend a conference so he just went
ahead and took over our cell phones in

200
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:28,479
the room and so gross out our certainly
have become so I didn't want to count on

201
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,030
the demagogues today so I nothing one
knows what this is I captured this scene

202
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:41,418
here this morning that this isthat

203
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:48,760
59 points six assists as the LTE control
channel that I'm receiving the stream

204
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,789
and we ve data channels so I was
watching our LTE traffic inside this

205
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:03,350
room I was actually doing that with this
little $6 I so so this is the the more

206
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:09,199
expensive one of a kind of look it so
it's all the 12 saal branded with the

207
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,620
company for new purple and other
researchers like giving up with all

208
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,639
kinds of tools or toys for hacking RAF
this is a this radio covers from fifty

209
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,980
megahertz 26 gigahertz transmit and
receive continuously it's a good one and

210
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,510
toolset that the user p

211
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:36,549
another I think important tool the art I
don't see hackers toolset is a member to

212
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:41,230
if you can get them I think there's a
new one coming out but the truth is a

213
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,850
fantastic tool for Bluetooth hacking I
was collecting lot of Bluetooth data in

214
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,799
here today have my process it tonight I
certainly turn my bluetooth off before I

215
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,080
came in here and I was curious how many
guys this seems like a friendlier

216
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,629
conference in state DEFCON were
contacting each other but I was so

217
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,010
turned off my bluetooth ran through VPN

218
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:14,980
another good tool as I get into this
protocol called The Killer Bee it's a

219
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:22,630
firmware update for four very
inexpensive z-wave cheese musique ZigBee

220
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:31,810
USB dongle and allows you to scan for
Gwave z-wave we've talked through some

221
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:39,710
specific use cases ZigBee just cries
1990 security though when you when we

222
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,060
talk through the vulnerabilities and
then finally a slightly beefed up

223
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,280
version RTO popular proposal chronicle
their spy another great cool so this is

224
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:58,680
in my my bag tag my rfk it makes you
have the antennas and connectors that

225
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,650
that helps this is another example
simply when I guess what that is

226
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:14,650
here's to that channel 39 and we can see
here I'm centered on 244 139 observing

227
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,340
the ups and downs of data transmissions
room so clearly we had a lot of

228
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:26,590
Bluetooth activity here so that this is
one of my favorite STR hacks and he now

229
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:37,669
works for me so the I W three was
launched in 1978 was the first

230
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,670
spacecraft in the world apply by a
comment and it was decommissioned in

231
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:51,620
1995 nasa decided they could never be
able to do it again and you know why

232
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:59,659
it's gone now it's right down and a
group of hackers forgot it actually come

233
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,410
back close enough into orbit that that
it could talk about it and they wanted

234
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,390
to reboot it they talk to nasa nasa we
we we hold off all those radios you know

235
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,430
twenty years ago

236
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,950
are gone

237
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:19,580
we don't need to happen so we can we can
rebuild satellite it would be nice if

238
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,980
you gave us the protocol spec but
regardless so nasa provided the

239
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,580
protocol's back and the deal was between
the hackers and nasa was that we can

240
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,889
reboot the satellite and fire thrusters
to get it

241
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:36,760
lined up correctly that you all done it
for k-12 STEM education just like a

242
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,289
really great feel-good this is a really
cool project and they actually talk to

243
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,029
it they rebooted it and they got the
professors I didn't get it exactly where

244
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:52,179
they wanted it but the fact they are
able to actually use this exact little

245
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:59,970
$600 radio to reboot a forty year old
satellite is absolutely amazing so one

246
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,740
thing it leads me to believe is that
they didn't need permission to reproduce

247
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,830
headlight

248
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,658
space communications equipment is
especially older stuff you can imagine

249
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,659
there was a lot of security on in 1978
so what is up there that is vulnerable

250
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:22,440
to reboot with one of these i think is
very interesting and I think will be

251
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,840
some interesting work around
exploitation of over spacecraft using

252
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,080
STR as I certainly don't endorse it but
I was just at up at Virginia Tech

253
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,010
actually and they have an incredible
brown straight stations track tracking

254
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,299
every known spacecraft out there are
currently 11 country doesn't play by the

255
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,320
by the rules on the radio frequencies
that they use for their spacecraft but

256
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:53,840
this was this was a really kind of the
ultimate hack that to me

257
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,908
combining computer software hacking and
and and the snooty enabling technology

258
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:07,240
some observations out of black hat black
at this year and DEF CON this year

259
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:16,190
really about a third about hacking
things really interesting exploit was

260
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:25,290
called point Anna they basically up a
firmware on to a printer and the printer

261
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:32,740
began modulating data at a frequency low
enough to get him am bound and band to

262
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,060
get me through a 24 foot concrete wall
concrete bunker wall so they were able

263
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:44,110
to turn a printer into an emitter our
back door note on the network and then

264
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:52,320
receive the transmission by str
obviously low bandwidth but was

265
00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:03,360
extremely innovative this was in 2010 I
i think we have seen this week we've

266
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,379
seen this showing up in the wild we've
seen that states with you in a while we

267
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:14,880
seen but I'm government using recently
sought in Norway outside parliament

268
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,500
several officials houses which were
gross salary cell towers and notable if

269
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,920
you do experience one of these when you
when you force a cell phone down to GSM

270
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:34,500
Bertucci I've not seen a modern one that
actually says its two-year 3G ppl and so

271
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,660
you're when you get on your mobile
device gets forced down your prickly we

272
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:47,150
don't know that in a really a lot a lot
a lot of the world depends on cellular

273
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:55,890
secondary application now an attacker
with a backpack with a row cell tower

274
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:03,130
who is near by you and forces the
password resets and intersect the text

275
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:08,780
message that you get the secondary
education and so you know for couple

276
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:16,940
hundred bucks now we can completely
bypassed secondary we you know we had we

277
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:26,880
had a guy couldn't come here today was
supposed to get 30 was camera camera guy

278
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,800
proxy him was was the drama this year at
DEFCON my god local and was last year

279
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,020
proxy I'm was

280
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:42,000
really simple idea is basically a
commercial products from a company

281
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,860
called ubiquity that allow a hacker to
tunnel wifi over 900 megahertz to

282
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:56,219
another receiver couple miles away to
this about his location my take on that

283
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,710
is gonna build do that with the new wifi
protocols coming out pretty soon anyway

284
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:07,810
but a couple hundred bucks worth of
equipment but what it shows is that I

285
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,149
think enterprises are gonna have to be
looking at older

286
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,340
airwaves not just the two point for 5.8
gigahertz bands which is all they can

287
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:25,090
see today this was pretty cool this got
hacked and the IOT village live so damn

288
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:34,159
son done it this bridge and I thought
one of TV's t-shirt today was pretty

289
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,100
cool I can tell that hung out the whole
time so this new Samsung four-inch sure

290
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:48,629
exactly why it logs and your Google
account and it has an SSL certificate on

291
00:28:48,630 --> 00:29:00,060
it that it chose to ignore and and login
credentials were wifi so when here at

292
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,190
like your company coming like Twitter
big enterprises are running their

293
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:11,670
corporations on Google Docs alright and
your refrigerator has your logon like

294
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:18,860
this is a program former Ford records
222 corporate secrets is is not a giant

295
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:25,600
gap and and it seems like every week
we're seeing another int manufacturer

296
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,929
who in beds or loses a certificate and
and I don't think the device being made

297
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,290
at such a high rate that they're being
made faster than they can possibly be

298
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:44,399
secured there's no way you can install
devices on the internet 1994 there were

299
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,680
1,000,000 notes on the internet now at
fifteen times

300
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,920
securely Globalstar this is the global
search user

301
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,670
this is this was really interesting this
was another IOT happened came out this

302
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,580
year

303
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:08,220
Globalstar is a low-cost satellite
network global coverage now they went

304
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,410
through some iterations bankruptcy if
you've ever seen a phone that I have got

305
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,600
a protocol the spot which is a global
locator like if you're hiking or

306
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,110
backpacking emergency that this device
and it'll it'll soon be can help you

307
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,590
location is it's also used on almost
every armored car lease the United

308
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:35,679
States and they use them attractive
routes and off the route they notify

309
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,480
there's a problem

310
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,370
problems while using one of these things
this really sharp researcher who's also

311
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:50,739
amateur radio operator was able to
operate in extremely high frequency

312
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:59,870
filter down comforter and determined
that this device is securing his armored

313
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:06,060
cars notifying you where you are when
you get caught in an avalanche is

314
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:14,690
actually transmitting your GPS locations
over a CTP like no es this is 2015 okay

315
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,690
and they're not even using a cell now
accidentally missing your certificate is

316
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:27,930
one thing but not even in preventing a
severe us is is just kinda mindblowing I

317
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,530
think it shows you the state of
insecurities device right here this is

318
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:39,820
this is one of my favorite ox I've ever
seen but by these 2223 bryant allen

319
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:50,110
spoke at the 2012 14:14 yeah these guys
were awesome if you there they got

320
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:57,129
dressed up like sailors and so this is a
very low end of the spectrum at the VHF

321
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,480
yes

322
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:08,750
and that was awesome talk at all times
so this is what 240 446 bankers

323
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:18,630
range so the low very low and spectrum
and and and I would put these systems as

324
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:27,140
nodes on the lg just like a a TBS
airplane tracking systems are up a ten

325
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,660
ninety megahertz I think only things are
become connected now with the enable our

326
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:39,660
equipment that allows us to all talk to
them and so they discovered that they

327
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,060
could fire the man overboard sensor
override the autopilot was totally

328
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,320
insecure there's a really easy way to
secure which is have a sensor on a ship

329
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,580
hey you know what there's a new matter
that's strange me bhi and it's really

330
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,960
strong account came out of nowhere I
kinda referred to this is like the

331
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,420
Somali Somali pirates to write imagine
if your pirate actually could fire man

332
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,440
overboard sensor and you could you could
you could for sure collision chains have

333
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,100
a ship this was a fantastic talk on the
low end that again uses technology and

334
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:22,209
we see this more and more black hat
black at a year or two the talks were

335
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:29,240
using history or fracking you know I
think I talked talked about GSM enough

336
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:38,470
of a go through that want to talk about
roosevelt hours wifi proxy attack I

337
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:46,690
thought was interesting but the what I
think will become wife I got a couple of

338
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:53,850
shoes wifi one is it really for the IOT
it takes too much energy for a wearable

339
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:03,490
embeddable we're looking at protocols in
their cult and ocean as you know ten to

340
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:09,030
twenty year device life's 444 there for
their sensors on what with no batteries

341
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,740
are very late batteries

342
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,388
and so protocols like wi-fi or just
simply too too much energy hogs and most

343
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:20,429
devices don't need a better bandwidth
they just need a couple hundred kilobits

344
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,060
maybe tops or even a couple hundred bits
in the case of a notion of 211 bits per

345
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:32,279
second some sensors that's really all
they need but do you think the new wifi

346
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,220
protocols coming out in the ninth earl
megahertz megahertz spectrum are going

347
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:43,658
to be a real issue especially enterprise
because they'll have their again the

348
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:49,379
enterprise they've got no packet sniffer
to see the stuff going out and and

349
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:59,950
that's gotta be developed bluetooth is
is is is constantly being period be up I

350
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,549
was being up today

351
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,640
you know really if you back up and look
at what Bluetooth was designed for

352
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Bluetooth was really just signed her
replace cables for short-term

353
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:19,450
synchronization it wasn't designed to
become the mesh network of the IOT and

354
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:26,180
not not only are their weaknesses and
Bluetooth and detailee there are so many

355
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,649
older particles but again we see we see
those out there living we did a i didnt

356
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:40,930
assessment of a datacenter recently and
in the datacenter the the KVM for the

357
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:47,490
mainframe was running an antique version
of Bluetooth allowed for impersonation

358
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:54,799
attack of the keyboard so you literally
like you like on the console simply with

359
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,060
a Bluetooth in person at stake and the
point was not so much ok well it's a big

360
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,509
deal to attack its Bluetooth in here it
reminds me of the early 2000 discussions

361
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,320
with us and we don't have a wipeout
there's a wifi policy no wifi allowed

362
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,230
except that everybody had it under the
desk and was hiding it anyway and so

363
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,940
building I think to the techniques can
put stuff in the enterprise will be will

364
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,350
become critical ok this one my favorite
to beat beat up on ZigBee

365
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:32,350
was a great talk on their 222 really big
ICS and home automation protocol z-wave

366
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:39,360
both of which were develops in a vacuum
proprietary standards ZigBee has a

367
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,670
master key and you only allowed to have
the master key if you join the alliance

368
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:51,120
of course on my Twitter you want to
search it I tweeted it because it's

369
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,880
embedded into every single device if you
want to join its prob a key and so there

370
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,780
to default passwords for ZigBee

371
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,410
because they're embedded into every
light bulb and there's no place in a

372
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:11,779
light bulb to change the password and so
hopefully these newer you know more open

373
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:20,490
standard protocols with with some peer
review on them will add more security

374
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:26,490
has been deployed some places ten years
we were looking at another data center

375
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:38,169
and we think it's like picking out here
with me the password with what has come

376
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,790
out when we drove by exactly what is
coming from what was coming off their

377
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:47,029
killer chiller is basically would keep
the datacenter cool so this killers in

378
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:51,520
the data center we're picking out by the
ZigBee saying please bear with me please

379
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,300
log on to me by default and the church
happen to be against the wall which was

380
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,000
against the parking lot at a security
zone attacker could just drive right up

381
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,710
point out the legality and turn right at
the wall and logon to disable the

382
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:12,140
chilling system and data center which is
basically does not have all those great

383
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:18,980
protocols the ICS protocol do to keep
themselves from blowing up you can

384
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:27,109
literally just turn off the air
conditioning and so z-wave

385
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:34,690
has just really got insurgency scrutiny
2000 2014 was the first time someone's

386
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:41,390
really reverse the protocol and z-wave
also was developed z-wave runs that they

387
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,670
be runs in a higher frequencies in the
two point for ICM been see waves at

388
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,549
about nine six megahertz again you need
to have that spectrum that broader

389
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:56,489
spectrum to build inspect these
protocols I think I think both these are

390
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:02,089
Patricia just target rich environment if
your availability researcher I think you

391
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:07,589
could just was these protocols interim
up going back to the better cuz we

392
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:16,239
haven't gone through disclosures yet but
we have we have bricked more devices

393
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:21,369
than not when we won packets so we we
implement the protocol stack and send

394
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:25,940
malformed packets the stuff is just
Brett and this is just small stuff I

395
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,869
can't imagine what happens if you break
it chiller in a datacenter it's just now

396
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:37,109
is an existential problem I expect we'll
see the same out of the way we just need

397
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:41,249
a broader community looking at this
stuff and and and I i think that I think

398
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:49,819
we're that groundswell I see that's all
for now yeah this was this was there was

399
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:55,339
the bash bug showed up in some light
bulbs actually a wifi but Phillip Hughes

400
00:39:55,339 --> 00:40:01,390
but it's acceptable to to bring someone
else discovered as well and so well one

401
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,160
or two at a time I think doesn't matter
in when you're talking about smart

402
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,910
cities that have entirely intelligent
lighting and you could turn the lights

403
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,598
off the entire city or brigham you got a
serious problem if you brick wall street

404
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:18,759
lights in the city and a lot of cities
are deploying on these protocols today

405
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:25,259
with protocol stacks are totally
unexpected so I I fully expect we'll see

406
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:31,109
some kind of mass liked or contacting in
San Diego and San Diego is rolling out

407
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:35,160
their their new smart lighting system at
the same time like something's got

408
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,589
happened i mean it's just that we will
see you know overlap there

409
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:46,040
wearables obviously one of the biggest
parts I think of the IOC fastest growing

410
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:52,290
ones there have been several really
great assessments done with top 10 of

411
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:56,740
them their alts portable they they all
leaked out information about them

412
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:05,129
they'll give up credentials down here
the reason I thought I honestly a person

413
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,340
that the only solution to that it's just
register my fake name because I don't

414
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:14,420
know of any other way to secure them but
they're gonna be some other implications

415
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:21,980
I believe around privacy and so you know
one thing and we're seeing me as an

416
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,940
entrepreneur startup this is really cool
as health care is expensive in the USA

417
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,660
but they give you a discount if you give
your employees wearables ok now so who's

418
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,529
responsible if they're wearable data
stolen responsible for that is that the

419
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,740
health care provider is that is that is
it Fitbit I don't know an initially I

420
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,879
think more on the on the private side
the files chris loves his discussion

421
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:00,570
this morning is what you're giving up I
don't have any of you have actually read

422
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,910
the end user license agreement of a
wearable actually had my lawyer if for

423
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,330
me and he confirmed that yes indeed that
data belongs to them it is not your data

424
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:15,420
when you strap that thing on you you are
the product and you are exploitable and

425
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,110
you don't want your data and so it's
typically running right now

426
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:30,270
energy which is pretty good attacks
against the there's a really great

427
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:37,410
attack on the nests but I like black hat
which was it was a physical tax of a

428
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,930
sore spot in the top off and slipping
USB in with your own firmware

429
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:47,750
enabling the multi protocol radio so it
has a transmitter as well as he went in

430
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,200
there so now all of a sudden you've got
a pivot point on to your network but you

431
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,740
don't know about that whole episode of
Mr robot with him through those wires

432
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,058
and was a lot harder than it really need
to be if I just had some modern

433
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:09,240
thermostats and so i i do think we'll
see you guys have heard of cyber Barbie

434
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,589
the new Barbie doll it's coming out this
this Christmas

435
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:19,240
IOT connected Barbie doll that has tens
of thousands of its kinda like Siri for

436
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:28,308
Barbie Barbie is part of the kill chain
now and so so so so so you know you send

437
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:35,069
your victim CEO's daughter barbara
Summer barbie and with some Alka down

438
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:38,359
there and that's you know you're in the
kill chain you can have your parent with

439
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,839
this sampling bridge his Bluetooth GPS
credentials your own net and so this is

440
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:51,270
this is the new normal enough when you
if you look at these these dolls there

441
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:56,900
they all come one or two companies
making same forum or four minutes and I

442
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,980
seriously doubt that he could go home
they're so so good opportunity for

443
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,690
sincere as someone's gotta feel free to
rip off cyber cyber BBQ lunch and i

444
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,760
really wanna see that show up somewhere

445
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,630
smart TVs you know your privacy
perspective and from a boring billing

446
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:23,119
perspective you know we've seen some
pretty serious theoretical issues there

447
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,309
we haven't seen I don't think any any
real time I've been surprised some the

448
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:34,030
other factors I haven't been beaten up I
kinda got a bunch of smart TVs and i

449
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,230
cant buy one of each player of the OS is
they're running and some of them even

450
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:44,049
really old versions of going through
which is which is very surprising the

451
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:52,009
hallmarks there are a couple of issues
around home locks the simplest one

452
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,490
is that there really isn't a pic with a
regular lock pick set and so so most

453
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,450
most most acts against smart locks and
up an extra three leaves lot easier just

454
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:08,680
to pick lock but regardless that appear
to Medco cylinder in there we've had

455
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,910
August lock for instance is one of the
bigger ones they had sent out an alert

456
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:20,450
before I S nine came out saying don't
install iOS nine or you won't build it

457
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:27,540
going to your house so I mean that's
serious serious problem like what if you

458
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,040
actually actually updated you could get
home

459
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,960
conversely these guys are running
protocols like a wave certainly exploit

460
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,310
up all potentially breakable and we've
seen multiple vulnerabilities and

461
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:48,100
exploits on these guys and will continue
to I cannot drain the swamp might data

462
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:53,610
center talked earlier but you know we've
done we I'm really I've become very

463
00:45:53,610 --> 00:46:00,700
interested in the types of a matters
that exists in in datacenters I was

464
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,470
talking to fish earlier about the Nordic
chip in or chip is the chip that's in

465
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:12,000
every Logitech Wireless microsoft
wireless keyboard and mouse set and it's

466
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,610
kind of up to them to implement
encryption which is not again not a good

467
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:21,880
thing because people don't do it all and
we were recently the data center and so

468
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:30,080
so a lot of this wireless traffic since
we know it's a secure you know we need

469
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,819
to figure out is it a KVM what is it I
suspect that I suspected aspects of wild

470
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:44,220
KVM haven't haven't dug into the cameras
as we know from our 3 o'clock today are

471
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:51,370
being being hacked not just over we had
a great case in the us- with the Federal

472
00:46:51,370 --> 00:47:00,100
Trade Commission ITC ITC kurrie wasn't
even a term year ago now there's a

473
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,080
security conference every month

474
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:10,150
and this one deputy chairman of Trade
Commission was there and she is a great

475
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,860
term when I like she said we need to
have a legislative scalpel not a hammer

476
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:20,670
for this but they they actually did they
went after the baby monitor guys who had

477
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,870
just egregious vulnerabilities in their
software in soon us' risky the Federal

478
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,690
Trade Commission going after companies
and we saw this was not checked there

479
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:36,530
was a very large settlement for the snap
and when they left a symmetric key in

480
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:42,310
their software when they're claiming to
secure all these pictures and so so I am

481
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:48,420
encouraged on cyber security perspective
that there will be financial penalties

482
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,450
for companies that make egregious errors
I don't think you know I think everybody

483
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:59,220
is going to make mistakes and have bugs
you got to them but you know the

484
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:05,629
greatest a car as cell service is
egregious and and and then conversely

485
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:13,410
it's my first of all abilities closure
was a remote a routine artists and Sun

486
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:19,450
OS in 1991 so that was my first cert
advisory so it went like basically 24

487
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:25,549
years of vulnerability disclosures it
seems like again it's 1994 where these

488
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:31,710
manufacturers are reacting legally as
opposed to handling responsible

489
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,670
disclosure as we've been accustomed to
with software vendors you we had to

490
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:41,180
educate Microsoft had educate the other
vendors but now these people who make

491
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:47,069
things not software per se don't know
how to handle it when they're happy I

492
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,210
would encourage you to be brave and and
and and worried about getting sued later

493
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:56,970
and get out there and get your books on
Dec this one's textin beat up quite a

494
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,990
bit but St ours and the axis spectrum
really are

495
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:08,950
revisit the depth protocol especially in

496
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,649
probably in this part of the world where
we have a lot of call centers we've seen

497
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:19,130
a lot of concerns because it is so easy
to impersonate a depth base station and

498
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:28,290
you can do so using software defined
radio so imagine the american express

499
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:36,400
call center in Bangalore someone setting
up outside in the damn with a base

500
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,980
station so that all of the headsets
route through through their transceiver

501
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:51,270
Bangalore Pune you know it's not hard to
sit on the road and be noticed and and

502
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:59,140
you know we can go back to the whole new
generation of a sleep freaking doctors

503
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:06,549
to be outside US Cellular the the
default standards smart meters their

504
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,970
other ICS experts fear that it operates
a higher level than me but I will tell

505
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,470
you with the Smart Meters are using VPN
z-wave I'm waiting for a Robin Hood

506
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,118
attack for someone to come by and
resettle power meters or resettle the

507
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:26,020
water meters water meters are actually
truly read off the meet the sensor drive

508
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:32,470
through a city industry said everyones
bill zero and again we also see a track

509
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:43,660
and other types of other types of
industrial systems being used as pivot

510
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,000
points and Chris points into into into
targets I think these these dis new set

511
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,819
of protocols can make even words and
then stop hacking stuff you know I

512
00:50:54,819 --> 00:51:02,369
bought one of these name of it but there
was a kids toy while estoy it was there

513
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:07,310
was a firmware mod you can make a
process that allows you to open its like

514
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:14,890
the old garage numbers but we visited
because it was protocols or scary

515
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:17,870
protocols on on a remote gate

516
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:23,450
door openers and so again more people
hacking stuff wirelessly with no way to

517
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:31,520
take those attacks cars I think people
have seen cars nauseam I think about a

518
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:39,790
second Dr Miller probably tired of
talking about carjacking but you know

519
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:46,560
hitting them over there over the verizon
wireless connection was only one way in

520
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:52,549
recently least there was recently a
disclosure where a kid simply modulated

521
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:58,340
laser pointer and was able to disable a
torrent of mercedes-benz enforce the ABS

522
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,540
brakes brake light armor saves now will
automatically stop the vehicle but

523
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,360
thinks it's gonna be accident and by
jamming later with a with simply with a

524
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,490
with a laser pointer and some particular
modulation he was able to stop car and

525
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:18,129
so I think the multiple inputs not only
with laser but short range radar all

526
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:23,380
these are jammed with all the you know
we see the tax in the UK attacking you

527
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,460
know I can sit my parking lot in the USA
and make sure no one can lock the car

528
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:32,110
doors of fun transmitting on 350
megawatts 43 minutes we saw this happen

529
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,860
UK where it was basically sitting
outside a shopping mall in jamming on

530
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,570
this frequency so people wouldn't hit
the button think they like their car and

531
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:46,780
other cars were locked and so I think
also that there were you can buy

532
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,000
capability to collect the key
information

533
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,670
keep up information reply sure I'm keep
up and drop off the car finally I i

534
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:07,390
truly these are higher and government
sailor sailor receptors you can make

535
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:17,049
yourself first half a million bucks and
I i think we're going to begin to see

536
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,300
these really show up in the wild

537
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:25,870
we're starting to see them here and
there we haven't seen a lot of them but

538
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,970
they will go there

539
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:34,290
to this and you know over the next few
words we will see them in the wild

540
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:45,520
animal in my last privacy this problem
occurs to americans but but the is is

541
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,180
going back to almost too late

542
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,370
data being collected are so you know it
comes to the free services like Facebook

543
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:59,330
or something clearly you're the product
I think that in the case of a lot of

544
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:04,270
these IOT devices you're also the
product and we are giving up an immense

545
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:11,440
amount of privacy by opting in I I
personally think the solution is is the

546
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:19,000
definition audio issue to riff on chris
chris loves waste at someone else I did

547
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,460
a blog recently about seventy percent of
Millennials willingly disregard their

548
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,890
information security policy so they read
it they're aware of it and they break

549
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:33,109
anyway because they just don't care and
so you've got a different into insider

550
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:40,970
threat issue now and these these devices
are gonna make themselves get us in

551
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:46,480
enterprise and unless you're on wifi
there's no way to enforce a brain BYOD

552
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,060
policy today because people have no
visibility the spectrum all the way down

553
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:59,330
to marine VHF up to satellite devices on
the OT so I'm excited I think we're

554
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:04,700
golden age or hacking I'm really glad I
can be at the front of it and building

555
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,830
something around it but I think the next
10 years around are attacking are gonna

556
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,480
be awesome I think we're gonna have some
probably critical problems and major

557
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,920
outages but there's gonna be a great
opportunity for innovation and

558
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,190
creativity and I think people getting at
the front end of IOT hacking your

559
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:29,850
probably have the most fun because the
fruit is ripe for picking

560
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,990
packing Windows twenty years ago was
really easy getting her mountain windows

561
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:41,430
today is really really hard but to do so
for the OT is fun I think I think our

562
00:55:41,430 --> 00:56:17,879
efforts you neighbors so that's it thank
you and have a ticket and they know that

563
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,080
you cannot trust that they actually
twenty pipeline they're actually hired

564
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:36,080
human drive-in attracts actually the
Barbados not connected to the Internet

565
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:48,480
two years ago there was a talker exploit
insects funny joke on the treated at

566
00:56:48,480 --> 00:57:03,610
your TV set will be exported about what
it is you know the yes some of those

567
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:12,400
talks as you mentioned our talks are
recorded so and I think I think the oil

568
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,460
gas sector there's a very interesting
opportunity to seek to secure those

569
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:24,480
matters and detects row commuters and so
just as my high level 64 maritime safety

570
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,440
is put a sensor on ship that the texan
you remember that came out of nowhere on

571
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,870
a pipeline scenario if a new emitter
shows up a new minister not show up very

572
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:39,730
often and the issue trigger an event
just as with if you're jamming home

573
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,160
alarm system you jamming home alarm
system

574
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,430
you gonna show up as a new sensor for
that alarm outside the house and so that

575
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:55,200
should be could be you haven't had a
guest house but that should happen very

576
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:02,299
rarely and so the the the thesis of
basically scanning the airspace decoding

577
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:10,060
the protocols like we did with tcpdump
or snoop or Wireshark and then we're

578
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,590
seeing the slowly kind of protocol by
protocol but it's it's

579
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:20,850
I think there needs to be some some some
some big moves I like any radio lot of

580
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:26,250
think it's kind of becoming the de facto
standard for manipulating data has

581
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:29,850
really improved quite a bit but
something else could come out there be

582
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:42,390
the snort or the nmap for the airspace
thank you
