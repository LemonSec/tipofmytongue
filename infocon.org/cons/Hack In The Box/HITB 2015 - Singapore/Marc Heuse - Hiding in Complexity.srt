1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:34,360
from the author of 16 which I kinda
promised never to do it again but the

2
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,810
lineup me please submit some food
conference no Asia the only the ipv6 ok

3
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,660
thats don't do some research to
something new and that's basically the

4
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,209
talk now

5
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,280
first words about ipv6

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,899
here and some people at the conference
in people kinda still seem to hope that

7
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,350
we won't need that ordered ipv6 will not
come or it will not arrive within the

8
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,810
next 5 10 years so not now

9
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,920
future of maybe future generations will
have to care take care of that that's

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,740
not the case

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,929
North America run out of ipv4 addresses
I think three weeks ago so if you want

12
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,990
ipv4 addresses us' you can get them
until you go to the black market and

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,929
everybody knows how much from the black
market is maybe there's a future a deep

14
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,630
web for ipv4 you need to buy that who
knows

15
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,490
future research may be upcoming yeah but
it's a situation even in Germany already

16
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,850
have a nice be well you don't get an
ipv4 address public one you only get a

17
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,949
private IP address and an ipv6 address
because they don't have enough ipv4

18
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:55,900
addresses for you so this is a pressing
problem and that's why I P six is coming

19
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:03,330
very hard right now so we just kind of
problem because it still in a state

20
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:11,930
where it's more like still in the kind
of more developed a stage and people

21
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,390
haven't really it to to what it really
means so in this talk I'll try to show

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,799
you two areas which have not been much

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,410
that yeah let's have a look I want to
talk about two things the first one is

24
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,390
something which is so easy so common if
you think about it but it seems that

25
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,309
everybody misses it and this is kind of
the weird part I caused the power of

26
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,870
these / 60 poor thing I want to talk
about is actually the main part of the

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,850
car because this is the innovative part
it's how to bypass all the ideas would

28
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:57,790
try to perform ipv6 and we'll see even
that is not so hard so power / 64 what

29
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,840
do I mean by that

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,000
before we get usually a Class C network
it wherever we are we have usually

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,910
classic network in this class can be a
maximum of 250 for possible machines and

32
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,290
that's basically years so it's a small
small network but large enough for this

33
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,030
room to be everyone have been in the
same that we have an ipv4 address in

34
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,760
ipv6 we have a / 64 now 5064 post
depends on how many bits your house so

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:39,320
it is big business small for a network
it's fucking big tits 128 bits so half

36
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,890
of the home network size is just will
open addressing I was sure the number in

37
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:53,488
the next light so does already pick
whoever as a customer and I mean end

38
00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:00,180
user customer DSL subscriber who already
gets ipv6 you don't get a / 64 you get

39
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:09,000
to / 56 this is way more addresses and
networks and if you are on a 62 portable

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,680
for example or you are small size
company you gotta / 48 what does that

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,540
mean in numbers this is the number of
possible host in one network in a / 64

42
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,889
you can put

43
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:32,490
the whole internet as we have it today
for four billion times in 21 local

44
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:40,069
subnet that we can put the whole planet
Earth with all the networks plus the

45
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,349
Moon and Mars all the money I would like
to see that switch but it's basically

46
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:51,419
decides that could be presented one in
one local line gets to / 56 we have more

47
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,539
addresses and / 48 I have no clue how to
process number its that's what I call

48
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:02,919
this is the number of addresses you have
available just for yourself and your

49
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,479
neighbor so next door neighbor in your
house has the same number of addresses

50
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,810
available to him so what can we do with
that if you have so many dresses

51
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,150
something which we don't know I before i
before we have scarcity of addresses and

52
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,109
I if you rent a server at a holster you
got one idea for a present maybe a

53
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,669
second one even many charged already
processional for address if your post

54
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:40,740
there and you have 16 / 22 16 don't pay
anything so you don't have too much

55
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,199
addresses so what can we do with that
basically one person can be billions

56
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:55,379
billions of persons so what do we do
with us for example we can use that to

57
00:05:55,379 --> 00:06:03,279
scan scan networks people think I and IV
scanning is not possible on ipv6 it's

58
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,960
actually not true it is possible and
very feasible it's just more time and

59
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,448
effort and I before but what you have an
idea before if you do a lot of scanning

60
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:24,050
it's very easy to detect it's really
easy to detect and for every host on the

61
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,020
other side you're checking it out alive

62
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,960
future you choose a different address on
your network that's very difficult to

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,909
detect because you never know is this
the same system it's a different system

64
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,000
who gets what passes for tonight if so
just for scanning using a different IP

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,130
address for every target is something
very feasible in very easy on the other

66
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,920
hand same for port scanning

67
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,630
getting attacked port scanning
techniques and detection for port

68
00:06:52,630 --> 00:07:00,659
scanning is all stuff again on ipv6 for
every port scanning you can use a

69
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,530
different source address and now all
your port scanning detection techniques

70
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,700
don't work anymore

71
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,740
again easy

72
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:21,360
then how would you do that so i GTG ipv6
would you be able to easily do that so

73
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,410
there was already an option that you
can't just say please use this as a

74
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,449
source address now I have just edited
edit it with the upper midwest / 60 port

75
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,580
automatically during my salsa dress
parasite is basically something like an

76
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,740
ARP spoofer for ipv6 so whatever the
return package come to automatically

77
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,490
come to your system and with these
difficult month you can already do that

78
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,210
the ice skating and the port scanning
and 12 coming from every single packet

79
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:58,008
from a random source address and bypass
the detection mechanisms this is the

80
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,990
obvious stuff actually another obvious
levels of course denial of service is

81
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,409
already from running for citrus soda has
lots of filtering being in place like

82
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:17,949
the first reverse path forwarding on at
Rogers and techniques like that but is

83
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,610
actually difficult if someone uses his
regular real / 64 of a compromise

84
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,650
machine and uses all these billions
addresses their this makes things much

85
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,000
much much harder

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,240
actually is options were already in
there so for adding or any pics arson

87
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,430
attacks this is very easy then let's say
you want to wreck boating Internet

88
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:50,219
voting for whatever this is a very
simple skirts transcript which just

89
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,890
changes your ip-address ipv6 address to
something random in your network

90
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:02,850
performs devoting and then that's the
next ipv6 address today this is not even

91
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:13,980
need it I think it was last year when
people on the legendary ports on for a

92
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,089
get together and Richter voting on the
time magazine where who's the most

93
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,720
famous or most powerful person or
something like that

94
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
indirect the voting in a way that the
first letter

95
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,750
owners of the candidate in the final
voting pronounce the name of a gentle in

96
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,170
the beginning I had some 500 systems
with ipv4 addresses are used to rig the

97
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,769
voting because every IP address there
was a time limit switch that if you

98
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,769
voted you have to wait until he's amount
of seconds until this IP address can

99
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,270
vote again until

100
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,079
this doesn't work for them when ipv6
they don't know ipv6 so there was no

101
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,820
limited on ipv6 but even if they would
had the same before I B 26 it doesn't

102
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,740
help because you have so many possible
addresses though it doesn't help you

103
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:12,770
know this is this is the quick
introduction on what you can do with

104
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,370
large networks because lots of people
don't think about that protection is

105
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,420
actually kinda difficult again start so
the easiest is to all if you want to

106
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,930
block something or if you would want to
do it analysis on something always do is

107
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,760
on a full / 64 so if you do port
scanning don't do it on ipv6 do it on

108
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:40,380
the ipv6 / 64 announces cuz everything
else is mood and the products they do

109
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,020
that at the moment so all those who
already have ipv6 and hope that their

110
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,860
ideas or locking whatever monitoring
mechanism in place that it will detect

111
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,400
that it's not working if people come
from company talent whatsoever they have

112
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,230
even more network but they use so for
the ports can you could expand its

113
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,780
latest afford to come from / 56 so you
have more tries more networks until

114
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,410
you're blocked and if you come from a
large stage 48 even more networks to

115
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,630
come from until your block so but still
it's something which is actually

116
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,970
feasible for detection and blocking if
you try to do any kind of Internet

117
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,850
voting on stuff on account because this
is really the only chance you have other

118
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,510
people have to register have an account
and then put a flag on the conduct a

119
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:44,370
discount has voted to convert again ok
that was the easy stuff

120
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:52,790
in a discussion with a friend where 2006
addresses blah blah a friend of mine he

121
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,740
came up with a different idea is not a
new idea six but when we talk to this

122
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,710
idea is that when I thought this is
actually a very interesting and

123
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:07,050
brilliant idea r you said well if you
say to someone who is over for example

124
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,000
what if the server doesn't sent the
packets of the connection back to you

125
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,360
but to a different machine or seemingly
different machine so basically splitting

126
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,970
up connections so you sent with one
source address to machine and the server

127
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:29,850
sends two different address the empty
reply packets this makes analysis of

128
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:38,190
network connections really hard and lots
of hands-on work I wrote a little proof

129
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,870
of concept for that where you just apply
used to dislodge 64 network and it

130
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,390
should this specific source Pacific
addresses and you have the same of the

131
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,010
service I'd actually it runs and missus
place completely so no need to patch the

132
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,640
kernel anything it was just the coding
less than 30 minutes actually to

133
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,120
implement that to speed up connection
that ideas doesn't know the connections

134
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,020
anymore so this is really so easy you
can even do more ideas bypassing I small

135
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,350
fragments and using random source and
source addresses for the target network

136
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,170
and make it even more effective as a
first proof of concept it's really that

137
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:19,709
easy

138
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:26,369
good enough so the interesting part
ideas everybody loves ideas minutes a

139
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,820
lot of ideas because they can show they
did something to improve security

140
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,510
auditors are happy because they can
recommend something because of their

141
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,640
checklist AZ ideas should be present and
medicines yeah it's here wonderful shake

142
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,199
hands everybody's happy

143
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,540
technicians don't really like ideas
because lots of work but they don't

144
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,880
really help the companies I know who
effectively use ideas to use it more for

145
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,439
compliance management like SNMP with

146
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,190
community string wherever it is used as
props up ok this has to be followed up

147
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:09,550
with more used for this or the the
normal user downloads and map and

148
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:16,660
performs a port scan or something like
that so something which is really no

149
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,000
security guys happy to to follow up
these kinds of incidents because they're

150
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,550
rather pointless so ideas

151
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,740
1998 there was it was not the first
paper but it was the most comprehensive

152
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,600
was the second and the most
comprehensive paper on how to bypass

153
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:48,210
ideas but they should I with playing
with time to live values with fake Mac

154
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:53,710
cheese AP act packet etcetera you get
the idea is out of sync and you can

155
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:03,400
bypass basically back then all the ideas
on the market there was a British guy or

156
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,060
something is his name is up in the last
three years and still sometimes pay the

157
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,819
debt and shows that even in current IP
for ideas is it still possible against

158
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:22,220
all ideas to by Pastor so you might say
okay how about I begin 60 if it works by

159
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,100
before with an established protocol
which isn't easy

160
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:35,370
not so complex protocol should be either
an ipv6 actually yes I do very very

161
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,320
quick background because who knows about
ipv6 year and up

162
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:48,170
refused so very quick background so you
see what the additional problem is an

163
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,260
ipv6 so why is there more complexity and
why do I go from hiding and complexity

164
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,560
so in ipv6 you basically have the ipv6
header before the ipv4 header and then

165
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,979
you have the TCP packet with the data
though this is how it looks like instead

166
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,800
of ipv4 ipv6

167
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,290
in the political field in the header
which is actually called next header in

168
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,540
ip6

169
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,300
is TCP and any other application data
this is how 99.9% of the pockets on the

170
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,300
internet look like now

171
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:32,709
ipv6 is special as in that it has a
fixed header IP four does not have a

172
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,800
fixed header which has problems for
routing and router vendors because it

173
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,810
makes makes you roger is more expensive
because of more ASIC required etcetera

174
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,890
etcetera

175
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,240
so in the standard they decided to have
a fixed ipv6 header but you still need

176
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,610
to have some options for future features
that are not standard for example

177
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,350
fragmentation is something which is
optional and ipv6 so how do you do

178
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,350
fragmentation if it's not part of the
basic had her anymore that's great

179
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,890
extension headers come into play

180
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:10,099
they are in between the ipv6 header and
the TCP UDP ICMP

181
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:18,698
spf whatever kind of appalachia you have
in between which say that the next

182
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,209
weather is 0 which is the option the
protocol number for the hop on hop

183
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,179
extension header which was in its next
header options feel that the next thing

184
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,400
is that Ethiopia and that's basically it
looks like that for a second successive

185
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,559
which shows an extra 60 which would
redesignation header next 44 which says

186
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,250
its presentation had her in this
specifies the next series you repeat

187
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:50,270
this is called header extension header
chaining because it can change extension

188
00:17:50,270 --> 00:18:00,900
headers how many extension headers do
you think you can have an ipv6 packet

189
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,290
with this kind of audience is a
difficult thing to get an answer for

190
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:10,220
that I understand who think that you can
have less than 10 extension headers in a

191
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:19,020
maximum in such a hundred chain and 35
interesting adhere to see who thinks

192
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:30,720
it's less than 255 hands up under the
standard and to you and all the other

193
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:40,360
things more than 255 more people in your
right it can be up to over 8,000

194
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,449
extension headers 88,000 of the thing is
in between and get you until you finally

195
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,050
get you something TCP UDP or whatsoever
you see that there can be some kind of

196
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:59,370
complexities so far this is how
extension header usually looks like the

197
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,790
first bite is what is the dictator and
the second is the length field for this

198
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,100
is the size of this extension header

199
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,949
this is how all the extension does look
like I won't go to do on all the kind of

200
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,350
extension headers the important one
which is interesting is the

201
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,189
fragmentation harder because
fragmentation is optional

202
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,820
why is it optional because less than one
percent of the packets on the ipv4

203
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,439
Internet are fragmented so it's
something which is a rare occasion so

204
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,580
why should this feature be in the header
it just takes up so unnecessary space so

205
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:40,100
it's an option because in ip6 reputation
is even more rare than I before don't go

206
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,810
into details why but how it is done on
the network so when when fragmentation

207
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,340
actually appears so in the fragmentation
has always paid by the length of the

208
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,070
next header always points to what is the
next batter like TCP UDP ICMP or another

209
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,620
extension had 20 course you have the
fragmentation offset which is as

210
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,379
everything and ipv6 it's counting opted
so in eight of bites so the SERO it's

211
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,750
the first it's the first fragment if
it's something like one hundred so it's

212
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,770
the opposite of 800 bytes

213
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,010
of course not the first packet and you
have a flack the more fragments but if

214
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,930
this one is set it means more fragments
are coming if this but has not said it

215
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,420
means is the last fragment we have
standard fragmentation with one special

216
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,900
feature a special feature is something
that's not possible without before it

217
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,190
can be the first fragment recommendation
of the euro and it came to the last

218
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,220
fragment as well

219
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:44,760
the first fragment and last record in
one fragment it's basically a

220
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,379
doubleheader but it's possible I believe
actually for some weird things it's

221
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:59,300
actually need it it's actually a feature
so we have fragmentation and we have

222
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,550
lots of extension headers

223
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:10,100
like we could have over a thousand
extension errors so the first

224
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:19,000
wow this is big as lot stuff what can we
do that so when we talk about ok this is

225
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,780
a base as additional possibilities that
we have to bypass I

226
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,080
ideas in comparison to appear before
starr's the question is what is the

227
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,710
basic methodology to actually find ideas
ideas bypasses the first up might

228
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,640
surprise you

229
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,010
because first is what packets are
actually accepted by the target with

230
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,450
there are lots of ideas

231
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,960
bypasses you will find but actually
Windows or Linux would just throw the

232
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,890
packet away and have found a great
bypassed it just doesn't help you so

233
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,590
actually the first step is rather check
what is kind of quirky and package you

234
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:07,220
can generate that for example linus
Windows OS X still except with these you

235
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,820
create test cases ok with these crooks
if I do the packet stream like that it's

236
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,100
just been picked up by the ideas or not
that's the best place to ask a separate

237
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,969
and then you should have a forum of
different ideas and tried exports and

238
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,100
that's basically what I did and yeah

239
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,480
so the attacks on ideas I classify into
different kinds the first I call the

240
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,720
disruptor packard's disruptive package
means the IDS sisters connection losses

241
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,960
this state on the connection so it can't
do any interpretation on the content

242
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,760
anymore but it seems something is kinda
wrong but doesn't know what it can give

243
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,460
you whatever standard common alarm but I
can tell you it's this attacker that

244
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,870
attack or it's really critical or is
already

245
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:03,969
you networks already own it can only say
oh this is kind of weird help me help me

246
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:13,370
help me an example in really appellant
example is stored in that regard to

247
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:20,739
snort is for ipv6 is really something I
cannot recommend for example for this if

248
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,539
you want to do it disrupt terrorist
attack against north and business

249
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,070
document is known that is nothing like
20 there is something that this is wrong

250
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,730
on basically you just put over eight
extension headers in your pocket before

251
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,330
you do your whatever kind of attack and
snot will simply say yeah you know there

252
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,178
was a pan with too many extension
headers but no clue for the den that

253
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:51,250
helped so whatever SMB at school
injection whatever kind you want to do

254
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,990
just prepend that's in your practice
with lots of extension headers and

255
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:00,809
stored will just cry and is in critical
or not

256
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:07,549
well all depends on human interaction ok
we're still picking up for this award is

257
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:14,549
not a recession and someone has actually
do okay but it's not automated block

258
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:19,970
etcetera as I said it's documented

259
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,800
it's actually a configuration options

260
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,870
they have option which is called
conflict max I P six extensions and set

261
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:34,659
it to eight if you want more security
you can increase the number to 200 500

262
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,810
but it doesn't make sense

263
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,370
the real IDs product or tool to walk
through all the extension as doesn't

264
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,699
matter how many it's the typical yeah
you know performance it's more important

265
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,440
and security and the security product
like if you have a viable the most

266
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,330
critical selling feature is the
throughput same kinda miss logic its

267
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:04,360
kind of here so this even to have that
is a bad idea so this is just one simple

268
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:12,800
example for disrupting the ideas the
other attack is I called the ninja

269
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,490
packets buy an injury because basically
the idea is completely blind it doesn't

270
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,650
see anything in the first place three
can't even say older something which the

271
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,350
order is in the tax no it doesn't see
anything saudis are appalled the golden

272
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,320
goal you want to go for this this would
be perfect if you would find any kind of

273
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,950
these so I would show you some of course
of this one because these emotions he

274
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,350
wants

275
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,230
41 but packet weird is accepted in my
talk that I have various tools for that

276
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:50,110
the best actually boarded the so-called
firewall 62 which contains forgot

277
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,479
something

278
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,710
25 test case on how you could you might
be able to bypass ACL's while gold

279
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:06,030
futures extension headers fragments
overlapping fragments invalid length in

280
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,320
fields that are aligned in a way that
they can make misinterpretation on the

281
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,530
package and lots of witness tough
fragmentation which show a different

282
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,920
different particle depending on if it's
the first second or third fragment on

283
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,480
what is the next protocol

284
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:35,770
here every fragmentation every every
packet in one fragmentation stream has

285
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:42,790
the frame same fragmentation idea now so
let's say it would be bad for security

286
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:47,480
but let's say it's just coming up with
the first presentation idea would be 14

287
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,580
that's packed has been fragmented all
the fragments would have the

288
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,939
presentation idea of one that's how they
can be aligned together it has an extra

289
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,980
field let's say the TCP packet and you
have 33 fragments what if the first two

290
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,890
fragments so it's a TCP but the third
fragment shows its unity what will the

291
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:16,110
answers to the receiving system do with
the packet will interpret as UDP or TCP

292
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,309
or through the way and what will the
ideas and what will definable think what

293
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,950
it is is a TCP UDP

294
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:31,850
the ideas come from the way so they have
to decide is TCP or UDP so this is one

295
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:43,020
of the many attack examples you can do
ya mind made up winners and liners line

296
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,090
of text very very close to the
implementation so there's very little

297
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:54,649
difference or actually all the result
all items are also working for 40 secs

298
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,790
I try to put it in the picture because
pictures I understand and I'm very

299
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,940
selective on what I could sticks up so
it's like there is a must be like this I

300
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,809
just know that and I don't want the
pocket and give me the Packers I that's

301
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:18,730
when those they don't care how weird the
packet is everything whatever you know

302
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:26,000
the americans that's the case and this
is the Asian joking I know how much

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,560
agencies sorry guys I saw you

304
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:40,740
yeah but it's how you can imagine it may
be related so while I know they allow an

305
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,980
unlimited number of this nation had or
so

306
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:50,930
1000 1000 its initial recommendation
letter yeah give me fine with it accept

307
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,640
any packets they only allow one of each
of the other extension header types

308
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,110
that's actually good so this is not so
good this is good they only allow only

309
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:09,790
one fragmentation had a dream I think I
should accept more than one

310
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,780
fragmentation had a well we got to
witness in a moment

311
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:20,129
yeah extension headers are not allowed
to be fragmented there is a drop by for

312
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,800
undergone which is on oversized
extension headers which is not an artsy

313
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,419
yet but Lynas has it already implemented
so why not drop anything with extension

314
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:37,240
header is so large as breaks the
practice and refreshments and if you

315
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,690
have the fragmentation stream and the
next chapter in one of the packet is

316
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:47,320
different it it will reassemble because
Falana said take the fragmentation idea

317
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,780
plus the protocol I D to say this is to
identify each presentation stream that

318
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,889
is actually really good approach the
planet's the only thing where they did

319
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,690
they should change this is unlimited
destination address they should that is

320
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,250
actually to only allowed to because
actually what the RFC recommends but

321
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:15,260
otherwise actually pretty good already
overlapping fragments are not so windows

322
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,400
7

323
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,750
how does this look like yeah extension
ladders whatever give me give me give me

324
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,770
you can also have an image fragmentation
address what does it mean yeah you can

325
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,580
have multi-level fragmentation and
fragmentation stream let's call it a

326
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,550
which carries other fragments that went
there and we assembled gets to a

327
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,710
different fragmented chain which then
again and again and again

328
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,960
like these matters which one is in the
other in the other it's something you

329
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,809
can actually do and winners will just
happily do it all day care centers are

330
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:01,658
allowed to be fragmented in multiple
fragments and decides they don't care

331
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:08,260
where every day now this is strange
because that was one of the problems

332
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,980
they have had an implementation change
the next header type in the change now

333
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,320
they don't allow it anymore and they
don't allow fragments is actually

334
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:24,139
something from I think 2004 there was an
RFC from Cisco which disallows about it

335
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,600
before Windows and Linux we're allowing
overlapping fragments really bad idea

336
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,049
and you have a different attack type
which is not really overlapping bad

337
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:40,059
reads ending a fragment so you have a
rock fragments trations dream and you

338
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,080
can't resent packets from the
fragmentation stream with different

339
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,120
content but must be the same off that
must be the same length but it can be

340
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,199
with different content and the last one
it has received as being used in this

341
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,220
already has a WoW ideas bypass made easy
right

342
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:04,679
this is the NSA option for that's not be
seen but basically yeah actually I

343
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,080
didn't need to implement that but that's
the best step 2013 create a test I guess

344
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,590
but I guess bypass based on the packet
weirdness and let's see what get through

345
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:26,649
my test bench was on three quarter on
tipping point and on March Sourcefire

346
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:32,260
was also on the list but I was working
together with Dr W who thankfully help

347
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,190
me in using their infrastructure test
that we couldn't we couldn't get it

348
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,460
running for the update process was kind
of broken so didn't work in two days to

349
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,779
get that running so Sourcefire is not
included but basically the same engine

350
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,930
so should be the same result so

351
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:56,150
all be configured to the highest setting
for tipping point that the hyper

352
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,810
aggressive more that's one way
recommendations would basically not do

353
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,129
that it will you will have so many false
positives don't do that that the hype

354
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,380
it's the highest regard to promote
personal injury recovery every

355
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,530
everything or rule was unable which was
actually was not a problem because the

356
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:20,050
CPU load at so high that for a detached
to be made it took 45 minutes because of

357
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:28,100
the high load load so it was kinda even
in denial of service attack on you know

358
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,469
and of course at the time of testing was
the newsroom update their balls of the

359
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,660
rules and engine ok

360
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:43,350
remains light of the presentation I put
it wants my because I easier for the

361
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,230
various kinds of tests and then you will
see what are the test case results on

362
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:56,260
the three ideas first time I actually
what kind of tested you do I decided to

363
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,690
make it the easiest possible for the
ideas to detect something for example

364
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,910
you could do a zombie attacks or
somebody attack which is a multi-step

365
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,750
etcetera and and as an attacker it's
easier to disrupt the ideas on the

366
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,699
connection so that they get out of sync
with a real connection so what I did was

367
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:25,509
basically it's simple get requests we
all the TCP day tourism one package of

368
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,450
the only have to look at that one packet
and that's that had an SQL injection

369
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:38,449
exploit in it like really like one
parameter 1 equals 1 etcetera and that's

370
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:43,199
why of course the only take that but it
was the basic test case not to use it

371
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:50,879
difficult exploit its heart attack but
an exploit that standard and the easiest

372
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:59,050
possible for the SGA detect yeah so
basic task to have one fragmentation

373
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,810
extension header in there

374
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,810
not surprisingly of course they should

375
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:09,110
acted come on otherwise use your blender
because he selling you a malfunctioning

376
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,650
product but it already gets interesting
if you sent to fragmentation headers you

377
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,830
already have a ninja attack ad against
the tipping point to fragmentation had a

378
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:25,509
different point doesn't see any attack
in doesn't report anything like this is

379
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,110
really like what the fuck the funny
thing is when you said nine or more

380
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,780
fragmentation enters 30 distilled
attacks snort shows error message I

381
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,830
showed you like it does help me help me
and tipping point with all 20 deadline

382
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:44,330
extension headers and dis one that's
actually tipping point gets a little bit

383
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,410
better now that they're more extension
headers yeah which also well okay but

384
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:59,009
this this is clearly a buck or as iPod
interesting attack doctor then a large

385
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,480
destination extension that fragments the
packet into two parts where the TCP

386
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,310
payload is in the second fragment
recurrence not detect this kind of

387
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,799
really standard attack and tipping point
against us just say something or you

388
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,100
know this is text messages this is kind
of weird but doesn't tell you that's

389
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,170
what's just phoned in to see some
generic ipv6 reassemble weirdness a

390
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,590
message doesn't tell you okay I'm so
this is problematic and is really not

391
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,460
like those super rocket science to
figure that out i mean these two can do

392
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:43,530
that many fragments many fragments is
you take the big packet and fragmented

393
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:50,010
28 by packets so many packets of very
very small again how hard can it be to

394
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,540
just collect the fragments put it back
together done is this is not with any

395
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:58,830
base in or out of order sending or
anything how does just basic yeah just

396
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,340
chopped into little pieces and set him
on the path you know be like a salami

397
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:11,000
like Italian Simone which are very fine
but I so yea again tipping point you

398
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,550
know this is so weird but yeah

399
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:23,720
this product sucks then the most
difficult attack for an IDS is if you

400
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:33,020
can see if you can send packets are
received by the IDs but they don't reach

401
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,730
the destination this is something which
is actually very common so you have a

402
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,330
central place where the ideas and the
server network team said no to whatever

403
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:51,950
is behind that so it is 123 hop counts
away so what you do you sent the packets

404
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,359
with the hop count that the idea still
sees the pocket to the destination but

405
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,290
the hope is not large enough to actually
reach the destination while you might

406
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,800
think well if there is a fishy packet
coming with a very low how come they

407
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,420
would say well this is kind of unusual I
mean by default in every network and

408
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,870
ipv6 you usually have a kind of 664
which is more than enough so you will

409
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:23,319
never see basically OPCON below 10
doesn't happen I have never seen that

410
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:31,090
happen seen that everyone I before so
this is easy to detect but yeah I cannot

411
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:39,340
retaliate none of none of this happening
so this is avail now an easy attack on

412
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:46,660
ideas so this is something ideas as to
protect against the first attack on the

413
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,140
hop count is two different for some
people who don't reach the target what I

414
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,810
did was based at took the same TCP
packet filtered with random garbage

415
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,240
table sets an expert let's say it's
random

416
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,479
recalculated CRC checksum and set it on
the way with the company don't reach the

417
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:12,620
target SEC 3 carpet and tipping point
Apple thing you know their packets which

418
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,660
don't have which don't really mentioned
the connection and that's it we're snort

419
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,779
surprisingly can still detect orders did
you take here ok

420
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:35,400
let's try something else I mean ok but I
mean really great so how about if you

421
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,630
don't send his apt later but we'll send
a reset of the connection

422
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,890
yeah now we're getting somewhere
surprisingly dis is where tipping point

423
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,440
shines sending fake touristy Pakistan's
don't seem to care they seemed to ignore

424
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,920
our study packets actually thought it
was wonderful I can take this out of my

425
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,950
list of connections I have to follow so
totally by posterity content snort

426
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:09,669
completely fine line through all your
tax next one isn't cut the price of

427
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,390
course we need something for tipping
point to come on

428
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:19,370
fragment the day top basically the same
attack nice here but your freshmen the

429
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,049
date in small pieces

430
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,820
duplicate them so the real one reach the
target in the other one don't reach the

431
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:32,130
time the and the ones who don't reach
target again with random date or X Y a

432
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:39,740
tipping point doesn't see any of the
attacks anymore and yeah

433
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,649
fake nine plus fragmented repeated her
so it's kind of this attack combined

434
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,820
with this attack with how colleges are
easy target only three Carter says this

435
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:55,630
is not good and actually the weird thing
is and reports invalid TCP checksum

436
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:00,580
reports invited to the future checks on
this should be the clear indicated

437
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,730
you're currently owned right inability
to PHX I critical risk for the net not

438
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,520
easy AP people know it's this is
basically a packet of weirdness on the

439
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,850
network business sorry three cartels you
and on starting point you going through

440
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,200
blind so

441
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:30,490
you have to question I know who would
eat which kind of pocket so I put it

442
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:40,759
here and you see the oh ok thankyou
thankyou Microsoft will tell you to do

443
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,560
this for compatibility compatibility
reasons because nowhere and introduce

444
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,020
kind of packets are being sent but there
might be so Windows is the big problem

445
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:01,180
with lineups yeah these work but you see
it they are picking that up so you don't

446
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,200
have an attack near the only attacked
that helps again

447
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,649
liners and also 06 is if you many
fragments and how the tipping point or

448
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:16,030
with the count not reaching the target
attack types that's the only chance you

449
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:22,270
have if your targets like tomorrow's
exhibits when those offices so basically

450
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,000
how you would do that as an evil
attacker you would check what is my

451
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,839
target for example linings Windows you
would check out ok what I D S is present

452
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:35,619
on the network if you can't find that
out because sometimes you can just by

453
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:42,540
checking the DNS entries if you see a
host names in oradour to being point ok

454
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,329
it's easy or you see a horse named with
IDs management and then you just check

455
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:52,369
the ports and you see which protected is
or even if this field you can do various

456
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,930
kinds of ideas stuff and see his ideas
evasion Stefan see which one they pick

457
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,710
up in which they check on the hosts ok
there's some attacks from there so it's

458
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,390
ok ok detected that one can still many
ways even if you can't find the ideas on

459
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:13,879
the network which is highly unusual and
then you basically have your mattress ok

460
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,540
does my heart good to have this idea so
does the attack I used to do my real

461
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,800
attacks on the net worth noting films

462
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,440
so as we can see here

463
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,810
tipping point really bad product on ip6
I don't know no clue how did how did go

464
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:39,740
down I before but on ipv6 kind of
scanning the customer three copper once

465
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:45,080
had the same engine as snort but at some
point they were not happy with and wrote

466
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,870
their own engine and if we compare three
contests to snort they are so key

467
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,970
recommendation if you have an ipv6
network is and you have to use ideas

468
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,870
because every ideas can be bypassed the
ricotta would be the obvious choice here

469
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:10,120
so there is of course also 2006 because
there is a very famous IDs bypassing

470
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,870
2005 before which is called cracked
rotor

471
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:20,990
yeah so this is of course called for a
quarter 60 very easy implementation I

472
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,640
use liners ip6 tabled an excuse so I can
do everything in userspace I don't have

473
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,000
to pitch a colonel

474
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,950
it's a work in progress or has lost all
the ideas evasion stuff I saw degrees in

475
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:38,600
there but there's still some more I want
to do but the best thing about this kind

476
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,240
of implementation I did you can use all
your ipv6 tools and networks can no

477
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,729
problem you some raw packet ipv6 tops
KPU want to use your problem you can use

478
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:56,250
all the ipv6 tactful transparently with
either from your machine where the store

479
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,200
is running or as an intermediate rotary
if you have work for example Nexus on

480
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,350
Windows but you want to use it with
these ideas evasion seals machine

481
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,529
machine which transforms the traffic and
sends it to the target network just

482
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:16,150
makes it super flexible yeah it can send
any more fragmentation to the nation

483
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,240
after his freshman Pakistani side
freshman to over large this nation's

484
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:26,220
headers and has the upcoming minus one
the tax and other stuff I want to try

485
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:33,529
out what the problem is I i dont listen
to the ER W guys so I don't have this

486
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:39,790
managed to me available on usually so it
makes it hard for me to do further

487
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:51,360
experimentation on that but it was lots
of fun so how can you protect against to

488
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:59,230
answer to that one is easy for you to
implement actually and that is to filter

489
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:03,020
on your internet work anything which has
exception

490
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,800
you could even internally say even
everything that is fragmented you can

491
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,530
filter because Tony should not have any
kind of tunnels and tunnels Rd only

492
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:16,440
occasion basically in an internal
network where where fragmentation

493
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,380
happens but if you don't have any time

494
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,120
646 whatever kind of times in your
network you should not have any kind of

495
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,880
reputation so in turn you could say any
packets with any packed with essential

496
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,110
had dropped for example as standard ACL
and rotors and then most of the attacks

497
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,500
most would not work anymore

498
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:48,350
the other thing you can do or what we
could do as a community to write and you

499
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:54,410
are free to make things better for
example the current RFC on ipv6 PC

500
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:58,319
fights well you should order the
extension header is like this who dis

501
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,680
extension had a should be for debt
bondage appear before that but before

502
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:11,149
that one but it is like should I just
would rather be changed to must because

503
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,910
it is so much easier to cars also to
limit in the RPD number of accused of

504
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,819
each extension header how are they
allowed which is basically only once for

505
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,270
each extension had only the destination
and are being allowed to be present two

506
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:32,490
times if you do that automatically the
number of politics and address is

507
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:37,779
reduced to nine nine or ten record
number of extension headers and even

508
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:43,720
that you will never see on the network
there is a good start at this is the

509
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,399
draft from undergone

510
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,910
implication of oversized I had a chance
which hopefully become an artsy

511
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:58,480
already has implemented mostly but not
complete here now so it wouldn't get

512
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:06,690
another draft for getting this right
that's basically what I have one more

513
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:22,710
thing that was 2007 2007 first showed no
service on everything OS platform by

514
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:26,090
adding a local network brought edward
Hyde and so this has nothing to do with

515
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:31,370
ideas bypasses just looking back at
history so you flat the local network

516
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,810
with random road record highs and
tablets which trigger if you don't know

517
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,540
that update in your routing table and if
you do all the configuration in the

518
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,720
package also that a system complete with
himself a new ipv6 address if you do

519
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,520
that with 1,000,000 running packets it
means one million routing entries and

520
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,940
one million new ipv6 addresses what
could go wrong

521
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,140
airports all the systems crashed a 100%
CPU load etcetera

522
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:01,420
there were actually the hardest one of
all to actually fix that they didn't

523
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:08,210
want to fix it took them two years to
fix that two years so that kind of stuff

524
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:19,460
so I did it actually a training during
the W and guess what happened with

525
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:27,780
current operating system os x report

526
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:33,530
windows and we've got a problem and

527
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:38,700
but it was because of a bunch of the
network manager just happened down

528
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:51,129
up not regular gone now just was using
dats seven-year-old tool in the training

529
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:55,630
we couldn't reproduce that but nobody
had windows 10 and Windows seven and

530
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:02,100
eight are not affected actually buy that
and the 06 machines worse I don't know

531
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,460
what the special occasion was but it was
great to have a training and above the

532
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:12,020
laptop open the door open and you just
want to show an old back part of the

533
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,950
TCAP 6 packet of course which I will put
online in just up the talk and before

534
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,439
lunch so you can already download to
play with that stuff and now we have

535
00:50:21,440 --> 00:51:17,029
time for questions

536
00:51:17,029 --> 00:51:31,459
and the problem is detected an IP is
blocked for example or you try to vote

537
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:37,919
on let's say next germany's superstar or
the voice of the whatever crap TV show

538
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:47,098
there is now and you and your IP is
accounted for that is nothing like

539
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:53,400
access to protected content but this is
where you can actually misused the big

540
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,900
address space you have available

541
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:59,009
something you don't have an hour before
so I before was gonna text ok disguise

542
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:05,619
for scanning automatically lock them
down for example an ipv6 it can't work

543
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:11,409
like that but so the dead more thing
more access to something with indicated

544
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:16,579
only for the voting part but that's
basically it even the boating party can

545
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:24,229
be implemented like you vote was 64 and
even if the user is technically able

546
00:52:24,229 --> 00:52:32,229
because all these are used they don't
know to have a / 56 but they have so if

547
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:38,769
they know that I can do some command
line magic food and other networks and

548
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:44,729
then you have 255 votes instead of just
one bill if houses and some people are

549
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:53,908
voting this is typically not that
significant thing is people must get

550
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:56,419
aware of that and do the proper
protections
