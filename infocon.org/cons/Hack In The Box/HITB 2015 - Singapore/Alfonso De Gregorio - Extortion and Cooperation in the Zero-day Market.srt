Jonathan was security career is old

you know what

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,880
after turning turning down debaters go
to the finish line first degree out of

23
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,430
this place availability and winning the
race Jonathan never thought that once

he found out with no rules no watch that

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,570
no court system to protect it is
discovery Jonathan but that is to say

26
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,470
that credible business formation or 30
days but it's considered riskier deal

27
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:16,900
players in the secretive 0 the market
based some ignorant obstacles related it

time it will report its creation or

35
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,690
every day can be the last day for
hazardous air yet

36
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,840
in this market we know simplest way to
look at his players finding buyers and

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,830
sellers can be time-consuming in may
require market participants with

38
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,770
business deals with individuals you're
not familiar with it was true intentions

39
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,299
are artillery fire

40
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:25,210
even if buyers and sellers managed to
find each other really is negotiating

41
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:31,698
fair price is often is often challenging
due to a lack of transparency and

42
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,520
doctoral levels of the boom will become
permanent residents within a given a tax

43
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,090
base level authentication required by
the believability difficult to

44
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,289
independently discovery has played
reliability and other factors or have

45
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:52,789
any impact on the market price but these
factors are difficult to measure in the

46
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:57,190
position of the security researcher is
partnering polish but it

47
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,190
tension that exists between the amount
of information the report is closed and

48
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,550
the possibility of losing the election
property as happens for other

49
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,440
information good proving the validity of
rebel rebel information without

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,229
disclosing it is often challenging there
are essentially two possible approach

51
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,229
reveal or demonstrate but they're both
undecidable the seller might try to

52
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,289
disclose the availability before end but
the possibility exists or by after the

53
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:35,840
fact to take it and run away with it
without by pain or decided it might run

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,400
away with the money if the buyer peace
in Arden sport intellectual property

55
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,789
demonstrating developed by led of
deformation of you inspired is not any

56
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:49,068
better

57
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:53,740
essentially whether its control over
full control over the computer

58
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,319
environment as an edge over the other
party if they carry out of the cellar

59
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,159
promises the seller might tamper with
equipment and by the decision to be

60
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,690
unable to verify its integrity on the
other end the buyer will be in the

61
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,330
position to record the work in this
light it is still it if they didn't

62
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,729
racial is to be carry out and buy
equipment even wars anybody ever built

63
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:27,740
plane can be sure to learning from
seller about availability the other

64
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,779
party might claim the same will be at
yes their own or exploit it as many of

65
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:33,750
these bills are

66
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,460
international in unregulated it becomes
our police force the potential contracts

67
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,000
and finally the seller might be in his
closing price to buyer in order to

68
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,520
receive the largest payoff but this
seems a defect in sell the same

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,630
intellectual property buyers this time
or the buyer will it be mean to protect

70
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,420
himself of course contracts many include
language to force the decider to return

71
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:07,550
the fund to refer to return the money if
they say do not already contractual

72
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,480
obligation but in this year old a market
the difficulty or identify soldiers were

73
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,310
tribute multiple transaction to the same
supplier of course context the seller

74
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,470
willing to be trained these are
obstacles the traditional businesses

75
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,400
service do not have to face any audit
will alleviate some resolve those it was

76
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,570
suggested to use punishment too
discouraged by from the factory were

77
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,380
punishment can be understood as the
public disclosure of billion abilities

78
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,080
resort on the use of processor parties
as commercial entities for enabling

79
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,440
cooperation market participants

80
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,610
example which are extra service or
educators or build a reputation cities

81
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,850
such as a reputation score where we find
them like Marcus as an instrument

82
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,890
establish trust relationship between
distrustful players today I will tell

83
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,950
you about the person starts about a
torsion corporation is eroding market

84
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,610
through the lens of impurity no theory
is boring him I say in precisely because

85
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,919
it's boring I went through to you so you
don't have to request use motivating

86
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,030
this research or

87
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,549
02 market achieve operational efficiency
even in absence of processor parties

88
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,240
even in absence of service in punishment
discouraged by from this acting under

89
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,320
which conditions can extort opponent in
cooperation with sustained announced

90
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
economies it what about the same animal
sightings

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,180
seemed unanimous markets this talk will
address is another question

92
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:57,839
providing trading strategies applicable
to each scenario now why I'm interested

93
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,530
in colleges and why you may be
interested as well I work at

94
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,180
intersections software security and
security softer exploring in try to

95
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,010
contain the space of unanticipated the
choice of my career was dictated by

96
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,240
dream I dreamed it software
manufacturers every incentive to build

97
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,900
security into the products

98
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:28,350
users instruments edge against me
permission security risks were exposed I

99
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,250
dream the security researcher a petition
is to capitalize only four in their

100
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,800
security analysis but that's just me i'm
a dreamer the realities the current

101
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,699
economic regulator alleged incident or
misaligned the store or in a factual

102
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,150
what we have sir today is what
economists call a market failure in a

103
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,590
market failure is about the inability to
self correct software manufacturers

104
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,840
maneuverable marketers software users
will forgo features translating greater

105
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,530
and greater complexity in a greater
attacks have raised in a casino for goal

106
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:14,900
then millions of Outremer today's market
I'll do we change I'm on the record for

107
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,209
funding be wise to first information
security prediction market this was my

108
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:26,350
contribution was establishing the report
is why I did a successful there is still

109
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,840
hope that we can improve our global
security posture it in order to

110
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,050
understand market forces behind is
eroding marketed the needs of our

111
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,959
community i turn my attention to the
dynamics of this economy understanding

112
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,150
the emergence sustainability breakdown
of cooperation is here the market is

113
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:52,050
increasingly important as our society
grows more interconnected it becomes

114
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,890
more interdependent within itself in the
more interdependence the larger day

they believed to be the information is

that this work find application in a

story of extortion operation is eroding
market we need first win the same story

130
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,329
or the bazaar tomorrow John made in the
shade over the future this is the story

131
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,640
of a dilemma faced by 02 market
participants were each given incentives

132
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,880
busboy each other you preliminary
indications are you the ultimatum game

133
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,029
is a game in economic experiments the
first player to receive the sum of money

134
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,279
in proposal to divide the sum between
yourself and either player the second

135
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,270
player responder choose to either accept
or reject the proposal if the responder

136
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,520
a 7-2 lead according to the proposal if
he rejects neither player see any money

137
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,339
the prisoner's dilemma is the canonical
game starting in theory this is about

138
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:09,420
you cutie rational individuals might not
cooperate even if it appears that the

139
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,880
best interest in the prisoner's dilemma

140
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,050
prisoner commit a crime if they both do
not confess to get if they both

141
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,780
confessed they get more severe
punishment even if one confessed her

142
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,100
daughter does not then they wonder
confessed getting very low punishment in

143
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,650
the order get get a very severe

144
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,819
I tolerated prisoner's dilemma is a
repeat game were the prisoner's dilemma

145
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:47,470
game is played multiple times now in
order to model 0 the traits I'm using a

146
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,480
new game I called the old a deal and it
showed a dilemma game works as a whole

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,130
30 days seller and buyer if they both
cooperate respectively in supplying the

148
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,870
little bit information you pay for the
same

149
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,620
receive a reward payoff are if the book
in fact respectively retaining the

150
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,280
intellectual property in the budget they
both received punishment P offbeat if

151
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,260
the buyer face 40 day at the cellar fact
doesn't supply then the by receive

152
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,180
soccer playoff race and the seller
little patience of the weather is your

153
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,680
day and get a run away with it without
pain

154
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,069
forcing the seller as free options

155
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:47,300
essentially the seller may opt to trial
record or to pursue two paths for a

156
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,729
match retaliation if First Avenue
retaliation is too close alternative

157
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,960
deals for the same intellectual property
without a buyer's

158

adoptive and Second Avenue recreation
resembling the doctrine of mutually

159
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,140
assured destruction is to publish this
your day in the greatest value to the

160
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,760
spider minimizing the window of
opportunity as we displayed a BLT I call

161
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,700
this scenario emad or mad but he met
regulation approach works as long as the

162
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,699
balloon abilities fresh and the payoff
for the three scenarios are as follows

163
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:31,118
in the submissive scenario the buyer
receives the temptation payoff in the

164
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:38,169
cellar decider in the doctor's scenario
whereby receives their refurbish PR and

165
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:40,799

residual cough and the standard soccer

167
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:51,739

between the temptation payoff is

168
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:56,709
strictly greater the reward via their
mobile office tricky greater than the

169
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,299
punch me they will pay off

170
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:07,358
is strictly greater also there refurbish
PR residual playoff spot in finally the

171
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:12,989
punishment is strictly greater than the
soccer playoff your remarks in the

172

corporation is superior to move to a

diff action but the relationship to
greater than or greater in S

175
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,779
in play defection is the dominant
strategy for book before Jones or the

176
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:35,739
factual is better liberation for one
player no matter what they are other

177
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:42,809
players who played in that scenario need
a buyer or the seller a dominant

178
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:47,988
strategy if we assume they expire payoff
to be greater than the soccer playoff in

179
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:53,009
the refurbished be off to be lowered in
there now if they betray seller as the

180
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:59,089
ability to close alternative deals for
the same exploits only one day i bowl or

181
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:04,760
what when a private spot for instance
dan defection would not be a dominant

182
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,980
strategy anymore but the market plays a
role in this capacity today is eroding

183
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,819
market is not a monopoly and his weekly
regulate but starting from the

184
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,938
implementation of the bus an arrangement
new lows regulation will emerge

185
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,789
instilled in his lawyer in this will
have any impact on market liquidity

186
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:28,369
demands

187
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,429
mysteries about into the standard
president the line where the seller is

188
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,570
the ability to negate the buyer the
temptation to the fact it does so by

189
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,960
making sure the temptation payoff
approach the punishment and the passion

190
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,920
is not a dominant strategy for the buyer
anymore now if factors such as market

191
00:17:46,920 --> 00:18:01,410
liquidity export regulations then the
seller should consider this clip

192
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,510
disclosing publicly did your day by
doing so you will not make herself so

193
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,129
she was going to get the soccer playoffs
anyway

194
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,550
pretty did other way around the seller
will use the buyer incentives to defect

195
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,159
in the first place now to design and
it's important for 20 the seller

196
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,330
inefficient means for full disclosure
full disclosure not for the sake of

197
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:31,250
bragging rights anymore but for murdered
a big impact as possible is closer to

198
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,100
plead guilty

199
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,610
a shorter day when the opportunity to
display her in the smaller the residual

200
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,389
now since July 2002 they pull disclosure
least experienced it fair share of legal

201
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:48,160
troubles away anything in a marketed
that will likely witness more loads of

202
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,890
regulation

203
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,170
here's what's your email least meters
late if proper steps are not taken to

204
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,150
ensure the annual meeting of the
semester all of this is to say that I

205
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,140
would not be surprised to learn about
the existence of it all day

206
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,390
disclosure platform researcher could use
it for me please close other players in

207
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,220
20 the market could use to retaliate
against it by ear

208
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,490
fact insiders 22 supposedly secretive
trade in inclusion surveillance

209
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:26,000
acknowledges that it was still a 10
looks like it's working out today as

210
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,220
long as the seller doesn't play the
submissive scenario the virus not better

211
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,820
off the fact the four in the one-shot
sequential game corporation is possible

212
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,450
if they retain the ability to punish the
by the facts

213
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,669
but if this is not possible if this is
not the case then the rationale is that

214
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,059
can provide emotional faction the
dilemma is that cooperation has a better

215
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:57,539
outcome limited faction but is not
rational outcome because the choice to

216
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,779
cooperated individual level is not
russian rational self interest point of

217
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:03,110
view

218
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,789
therefore I want to ask you if no form
of punishment can be undertaken by the

219
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:16,120
seller candy corporativo comes still be
sustained as an equilibrium they are

220
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,289
directed toward a dilemma is a repeat a
word or deed Illini game I just played

221
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,820
it all the drama game in indefinite
number of times now whenever the

222
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,139
submissive scenario applies the I
created a dilemma reduced today I traded

223
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:35,389
prisoner deal and therefore he becomes
possible to type in today

224
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:40,580
extensive theoretical and experimental
literature devoted to study or repeat

225
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,320
games do some prediction the emergence
sustainability breakdown of cooperation

226
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:52,720
in this area marked I asked you can see
the major settings the animosity work

227
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,320
readers know the identity of the party
you're dealing with anonymous at work

228
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,149
trades takes place among strangers in
the same alongside were either the buyer

229
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:13,389
or the seller is now France date proper
woman were published in 1959 it has been

230
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:18,019
well known that rational individuals
facing each other in that new number of

231
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:24,549
times can sustain the co-operative but
more recently with impressive Freeman

232
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:31,158
Dyson show how do you change the view
point in this game by showing the power

233
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,889
granted to a central player or a player
we did you remind if your mind is a

234
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:41,070
poetic way to say that the player
realize that their behavior can have any

235
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,290
influence on the point strategy

236
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:52,520
introduce a new class Estrada 20
determine strategies able to enforce a

237
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,100
linear relationship between the two
players course now 0 determine

238
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,909
strategies far-reaching consequences 40
D traders if one trader is aware there

239
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,580
are different strategies but opponent is
evolutionary player then the former can

240
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,270
choose to export the latter a player is
said to be evolutionary

241
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:24,160
instead seek to adjust their behavior in
response to whatever he's doing and

242
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,810
extortion strategist granted
disproportionate number I P off to the

243
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,290
explosion is responsive defeat him but
it's the victim best interest to

244
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,570
cooperate with the store police because
she's able to increase your score bodies

245
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:44,179
but is so doing she in that increasing
the extortionist score even more than

246
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,160
iran now the victim will never catch up
to the extortionist but we let sitter

247
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,410
because here we have an example of an
extortionist relation run into the

248
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:01,950
player X 32 share of punishment did
those awarded to date opponent white but

249
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,350
how does it work in practice if we
assume their reward temptation

250
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,050
punishment is soccer playoff
respectively

251
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:19,430
23510 now if I was an extortionist
player you were in evolutionary I

252
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:26,190
couldn't play this game with you if we
both cooperate less time than a complete

253
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:34,460
with probability 11 over 13 if I cheated
you less time than I complete with

254
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,980
probability seven over 26 if you cheat
me last time i could print again with

255
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,690
probability one and if we both the fact
I defect in this way on the long run

256
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,170
my score 2-1 would be pricier score
minus one will refer you to a paper for

257
00:23:54,170 --> 00:24:01,000
the city's residents are also show that
if both players are saying but only one

258
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,710
is the world's you determine strategies
than 800 prisoners dilemma reduced to

259
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,490
the ultimatum game let's suppose both
peers are sent into but only the buyer

260
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,870
knows about 20 determine strategies so
the buyer may choose to export the

261
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,570
center but the seller will eventually
noticed something is amiss because

262
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,270
whenever she tries to improve your score
in that improving the biased or even

263
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:31,440
more than the narrow now every year in
mind she may eventually decide to

264
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,580
subvert aged scores of both in if she
does so I traded preserved lemon reduced

265
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,639
adult ultimatum game with the buyer
proposing interference in the cellar

266
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,780
responding either rejected the proposal

267
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,780
finally presentation showed that if both
players are scented knowledgeable about

268
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:03,480
20 determine strategies then they can
choose to agree on a generous 0

269
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,270
determine strategy if any tentative
talks toward opponent result result in a

270
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,950
lower offer both before the Russian
thing to do is to agree only fair

271
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,410
cooperation strategy and they can do so
by unilaterally site independent

272
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,420
strategy

273
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,990
agreed upon that presumably the martian
possible now whenever they do so neither

274
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,360
player can improve your score by
violating the strategy and it is Spanish

275
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:37,179
for any period militias violation simile
similarly to what we so bored extortion

276
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,300
inspiration here we have a general
strategy runs into the playwright's

277
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,899
details to share both word then those
awarded to the point why in practice if

278
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:54,180
we assume the same as we did before two
players knowledgeable about can follow

279
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,779
this case if they both cooperate then
they keep operating

280
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:05,080
if the player iraq's shiite-led Wireless
time the next cooperate with probability

281
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:12,359
80 per 10 if white sheet attacks then
acts cooperates with probability three

282
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,449
overtime and if they both the fact X
corporation again with probability to

283
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,779
over 10 on average on the long run to
score of AXMIN would be nice to discover

284
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:30,940
why months but all the results cited
support apply only will market will

285
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,450
market participants ability to identify
the party they're dealing with

286
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,839
identification is required prescribe
must action with the same market

287
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:45,190
participants to choose prodigies
according to the outcome of past in

288
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,899
production but nowadays there are a
number of black markets were free

289
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,309
traders are anonymous

290
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,330
therefore is never advised his

degree of cooperation with subject see
obligatory without observing I don't

296
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:29,719
might result from discussing destroyed
pretty experienced on and on for more

297
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:35,059
interestingly they observe also that
personal punishment

298
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,999
significantly promotes cooperation in
experimental treatment subject were

299
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:45,499
given the possibility to observe actions
order game into fleet at a cost they

Asadi did so by adding a second stage to
the one-shot game and this stage

Madison adios endowed a dilemma the 4d

303
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:07,820
result applies also in our society in
the same treatment period were observed

304
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,320
opponent the fact sometimes employed
personal punishment which is to say

305
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:20,080
action was taken cooperative mode in the
following periods and players show to

306
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,610
collect extensive evidence showing that
place of preference for image

307
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:31,360
retaliation over the informal recreation
in this form of punishment was also

308
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,870
found to be efficient because the fact
also had been punished by operator were

309
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:40,559
more likely to cooperate in the
following periods before personal

310
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,840
punishment can be understood as a public
good on the one hand it significantly

311
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,720
promote increased cooperation on the
subject to benefit the most are

312
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,200
co-operating replenish leader now for
the sake of completeness this tarnower

313
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,639
tension to see me a 90 day markets this
scenario documented by the present time

314
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,908
according to the leaked documentation
the co-founder and chief technology

315
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:18,470
officer of the company was approached in
March 2014 by an online security seller

316
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,929
proposal Windows local privilege
escalation exploit it some research

317
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:28,750
services now called up by the chief
technology officer for the chief

318
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,019
operation officer recommended against
closing any deal with anonymous

319
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,659
individuals reaffirmed that
accreditation is of the essence

320
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:46,159
therefore I want what was the chief
operation officer you can trust

321
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,649
anonymously resellers in place would you
have trusted seller resupplying you know

322
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:58,508
they my answer to this past

323
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:05,450
corollary to the analysis both in
particular if one parties are not the

324
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:11,409
only country apart as not guilty no
issues already had any deal with that

325
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:19,220
market participants therefore the latter
can benefit from it is forced to choose

326
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,350
their strategies as an evolutionary
player would do this means that the

327
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,928
anonymous party

328
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,269
if Dennis parties knowledgeable about 20
determine strategies can choose to

329
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:36,499
extort and this is very interesting
because shows while the operation in

330
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:45,110
emerging economies extortion completely
free markets all which is to say that

331
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,820
the integration of the chief operation
officer reneging team was quite right

332
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,700
there for today I have some good news

333
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:01,259
cautionary note is sick recommendation
to your day traders these are the key

334
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:06,110
takeaway of like to live for today so
please bear with me for one minute

335
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:12,729
longer 20 the market can achieve
cooperation even in absence of the

336
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,730
parties even in absence of school
educators corporation can be sustained

337
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:24,249
even when traders are anonymous in
punishment is ineffective is limited its

338
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:30,749
corporate raiders from acting but be
careful as possible to get extort if he

339
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:35,590
knows about 10 determine strategies and
we simply seek to adjust our strategy to

340
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:42,439
maximize our own profit before the six
recommendations yet today 20 day traders

341
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,740
are worried

342
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,559
first do no deal with anonymous traders
if you cannot assure you know own

343
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:56,610
anonymity cycle discouraged action by
parties brinkmanship forecasting future

344
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,299
in every decision your counterpart

345
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:06,879
respond consider punishing faction to
promote cooperation

346
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:11,668
seller can do this by closing authority
deals for the same collection property

347
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:19,830
for 40 60 day or publishing this
Saturday if the facts for let the seller

348
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:32,449
will learn about 20 determine strategies
if play on the market in seat for every

349
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:40,179
defect if you see the faction will play
play market and their ability to punish

350
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:46,990
the point and that that's pretty much as
far as your egos of course in order to

351
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:52,399
put this recommendation pharmacy grounds
experimental verification is to be

352
00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,439
carried out so if you please get in
touch before it one last remark to me

353
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,490
because the last time I get the pleasure
to be carried out in the box conference

354
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:13,659
that we were in Amsterdam I'm reminded
about one see who open in the death of

355
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,999
misery

356
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:23,649
bill Connors in music inside me know if
you'd like me believe that insecurity or

357
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:29,258
the presence of medical supplies is the
mystery of our time if you believe that

358
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:34,840
if you like me believed in securities
the misery of our time and the same time

359
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,480
you like me are also sanguine about our
ability to obtain better security and to

360
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,359
give our children the chance to reach
confidence in the process which they

361
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:51,049
will entrust their business then we can
paraphrase against say that we are open

362
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,830
in the death of insecurity there is
still carnage your army in music inside

363
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:16,639
us thank you

364
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:31,500
I was able to extort if I come to you
and I say hey I've got a zero don't want

365
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,889
to sell it how am I going to extort you
in that scenario extortion me emerged

366
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:43,829
from repeated interaction with the same
party so there is an ongoing solar

367
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:50,289
producers for instance approaching a
company like a canteen or whatever and

368
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,669
Sally again again

369
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:59,700
new information is your day its place by
doing so this party dance party can

370
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:07,019
follow one of the strategies described
before the talk specifically in the

371
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:13,720
iterated case its associated a isolated
case is not just they're using a gun to

372
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,828
say okay give me money doesn't work like
that but still

373
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:26,829
if for some leader relationship between
the final playoff hockey team in the 02
