1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:18,349
enemies to dimitri British school

2
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:26,920
certainly today will tell you about it
before it and how checker can compromise

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:36,640
your company if you have your employers
as a peer pressure using only one that's

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,210
so cool little bit about me and said my
name is military security researcher in

5
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:52,409
your company relies on business
applications I did a lot of interesting

6
00:00:52,409 --> 00:01:00,549
test for different earpieces terms most
of them as a PA system that's why I know

7
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:07,610
little bit however tracker can try to
compromise is this type of systems as a

8
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,609
separate work in Europe scam company we
our group of security researchers who do

9
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:21,859
security assessment for different
enterprise systems so if you do not know

10
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:27,380
what is this a piece of cake recipes the
most popular business applications in

11
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,689
the world a lot of different
international companies use the soapy

12
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,189
answer your PC's to force it works on
the slide you can see a lot of

13
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:46,369
well-known local bloggers of different
companies all these companies you that

14
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:57,109
subpoena for these for their business
processes and has a different platforms

15
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:03,990
but we can dedicate humane it's a
possibility Raby AP as a punitive

16
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:11,660
general is the people's object it's a
behavior it's more than solution of

17
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:20,269
and supports memory data base by
platform it's my mind solution from its

18
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:30,570
a big company today would improve our my
talk discuss how to compromise company

19
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:38,690
through all this all these systems but
today I will tell you about my bio so

20
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:48,570
this Policy or bring your own devised
this policy permit employers of company

21
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:56,120
to bring personal mobile devices like
smartphones tablets etc to their work

22
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:11,320
ways to use those devices to access to a
business information for daily job so

23
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,470
and of course companies cares about is a
confidential information that why is

24
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,880
this classification MGM or mobile device
management this type of application and

25
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:32,190
now to city administrator rules control
employers devices and solutions allow to

26
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,310
apply different policies on them about
force on the table etc

27
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:46,030
allowed to control what different
application which users can install

28
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:54,300
those devices allow to tricking users
get location of the phone etc

29
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:02,620
actually very useful for system
administrators and today and of course

30
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:11,670
it's a big company has MDM solution it's
a PFR and today I will tell her about

31
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,839
what about security here forever

32
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:25,859
it's been four was released in 1997 my
company session express the profession

33
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,210
was to which allow to system
administrator get a remote control

34
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:46,780
user's computer right now we have
reference number 706 exactly this

35
00:04:46,780 --> 00:05:00,369
version we analyze version seven point
all 75 but modern version is a seven

36
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:11,680
point oh there's politics so very
typical personality for MDM solutions

37
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:22,120
allow us to get all information about
user about user tablets get information

38
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:31,479
about activities about call about cults
about messages allowed to apply

39
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:43,630
different policies on the slide you can
see a picture of the left side you can

40
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,409
see a phone 404 area you the show is
power

41
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:59,869
for a client or the portable devices for
a client exists for all modern operating

42
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:12,749
systems for 400 mile or even for Nokia
Symbian operating system so I frankly

43
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:21,669
and contain try to get information from
Users forum send this information for

44
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:31,748
the weight of a forest server start on
the company for campaigns Derby web

45
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:41,889
server administrator consult with each
other about a ferrier we should mention

46
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:50,119
about policies which exists in a
subpoena for its appeal for exist three

47
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:55,219
different policies remain policies
enrollment policy configuration policy

48
00:06:55,219 --> 00:07:05,679
and application policy Roman political
policies described how blind will be

49
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:11,628
connected to forests error into this
policy administrator create a special

50
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:21,199
court which users enter into a foreign
client actually it's not just called it

51
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,860
quote from ural shortening services like
it

52
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,529
tenure on something like that so in
admitted a panel at the city

53
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,729
administrator as a Peace emissary to
create this time Europe court and

54
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:46,089
provide escort to the user does it mean
if if you try to root for a different

55
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:51,420
Daniel coats probably we can get

56
00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:02,370
information about different different
other sources for Cydia and how climbed

57
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,380
under 10 which type of 40 shorting
series it was used it's a very simple

58
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:20,990
the first letter of described which
Danielle Harris was used for example of

59
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:29,510
the obvious example screen you can see
the pro-choicers 8903 the next one

60
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:39,450
policy configuration quality regardless
of this policy has appeared mystery tour

61
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:47,000
which for example possible policy was
will be implemented

62
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,260
Portable two eyes and mister can disable
or enable a morale is able

63
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,470
Lu two point black-and-white least for
my foreign I find it also visible green

64
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,430
shirt or maybe he can

65
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:11,900
Gration like a situation which allow
users use for only work hours etc it's

66
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:26,280
very a lot of different configurations
can be said by administrator and the

67
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:36,199
family its application political again
written policy but interesting 'cause in

68
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,320
this policy administrator can point
which application will be installed on

69
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,320
the portable devices during the
connection so administrator can point to

70
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,680
application in Google Play

71
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,319
after and interconnection network
connection is application will be

72
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,040
applauded the portable device also
mister can applaud their own devise

73
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:20,329
their own application on the application
policy that's how we can install an

74
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:29,850
application broadway's it's so of course
its appeal for air collect all possible

75
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:37,649
information about user or portable
device but call publication hardware

76
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:44,370
information application formation which
application used as a truck this house

77
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:53,480
administrator panel looks like you can
see is formation about hardware about

78
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:03,430
which operating system used for anti
about these about Bluetooth as possible

79
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:11,520
things and also information about
activities about where we're

80
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:18,920
what the network was used as a
communication cause of area used

81
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:28,329
different protocol for communication for
use HTTP protocol for admitted racial

82
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:37,360
you know its net protocol is a protocol
for up for its profit or protocol

83
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:49,010
four main world so and some 40 miles and
push notification through Google or

84
00:11:49,010 --> 00:12:02,490
Apple cloud also positive reviews so I
the main exam had frequent use of

85
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:08,290
protocol for getting and retrieve
information from the server its proper

86
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:18,870
protocol encryption exist or security
things also available so it's your right

87
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,700
now I understand what is the fire out
works and what is in them thar we've

88
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:35,709
been forever nimble and put the wall few
good things which I was into a subpoena

89
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:45,029
for first of all its application thank
you all for a client was a skate for

90
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:50,220
example if you try to compile Android
application for Android plan for our

91
00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:03,390
area you can get a human-readable
classname at the 2004 skate even the

92
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:10,110
complaint or craft during the complaint
process it's it's a good thing is also

93
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:16,450
widely considered to be called HDB
request for

94
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:26,500
Afaria it's also a lot of different
parameters exist even if you change one

95
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:34,890
of them is to be several reject your
request so also means very hard to

96
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:41,980
understand how it works it's a lot of
different parameters and other good to

97
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:52,110
things like Rudy takes the top that bad
things more interesting for me

98
00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:04,560
rebuilt itself was a misinterpretation
an attacker can send XML request to the

99
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:13,709
various ever without any optimization
and point this request their own IP

100
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:22,180
address and during the person is this
XML API will try to establish connection

101
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:29,099
with pointed IP addresses and during
this connection disclosed some

102
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,900
interesting information about person
about companies etc it's very useful for

103
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,170
future attack

104
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:52,719
of the serious side we find a lot of
different overflow mine explosion killed

105
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:01,949
civilians syllable abilities attacker
concerned just a big request will stop

106
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:08,500
it's very stupid but they exist so
that's how an attacker can easily stop

107
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:17,170
its appeal for reliability breezy but
for big companies even the type of

108
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:25,660
service attack is very dangerous course
sometimes it if we can stop your PC's

109
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:32,630
tomorrow as a political system some
business process can be stopped also so

110
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:42,019
another one example but we should
resolve execute arbitrary code on the

111
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:50,519
operating system of several of authority
over right now as happy course close

112
00:15:50,519 --> 00:16:00,290
within the next 10 abilities it's a lot
of different part of it will use of

113
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:13,610
different places in its appeal for it
can be some help setting for example in

114
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:26,029
this file setting fire to find the name
of operating system and both 44 this

115
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:34,130
user of course password is encrypted but
groups but with encryption also not very

116
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:44,560
well if you talk about eclipse and
actually encryption is good option it's

117
00:16:44,560 --> 00:17:05,659
so creeped out ridden by found a lot of
people in 254 scored a lot of which

118
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,490
allowed to enter Israel decrypted all
sincerity stuff for example these key or

119
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:20,569
these key sequences are used as
encryption but again and keep the turkey

120
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:30,190
very very accurate encryption key its
very best practice so that means if I

121
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,470
know this key you can easily get
information or encryption from it and

122
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:43,340
sometimes with the very strange
encryption function like this one group

123
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:52,100
think actually this function do nothing
just just returns exactly the same thing

124
00:17:52,100 --> 00:18:11,370
given X but I said well it's a shin
that's why this why probably a lot of

125
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:26,199
different way based on ability exists in
two and we found fewer abilities I will

126
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,799
tell you about taught how to take a
result and figuration can inject

127
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,280
malicious payload

128
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,320
malicious payload into administrator
panel but first of all I'm sure

129
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:48,010
described what happened if we will try
to sent connection request to their

130
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:55,220
first ever result in inflation if you
try to send to their parents ever

131
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,760
where where we point when we send if you
send

132
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:09,789
I'm enjoying for I want to free I have
read our blog what happened of course a

133
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,510
pirate or as a client is not approved
but what interesting of the

134
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:24,370
administrator panel of the device least
devices remain workplace for

135
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:35,000
administrator Depot place went when an
open invite list will be showed

136
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,409
administrator and the device least we
can create a lion we our Android

137
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,720
our money

138
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:55,760
some information about this forum about
i mean but this device will not be

139
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:04,340
approved so that's how we can inject
some information without vacation into

140
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:17,350
but our goal it's inject JavaScript and
injection exist in to IM field so we can

141
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:28,820
we can point to build our generous keep
a log into administrative panel but

142
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:44,549
little problem exists cause I'm on the
life I am it can be only 50 50 chance

143
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:56,850
that the plan but we cannot create any
useful law but we can say a lot of

144
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:11,370
different requests be different I mean
and point john was a little per load

145
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:20,110
after that will be concatenated in one
useful malicious javascript

146
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:33,590
out work we just sent you a request to
in into each equipped with a little part

147
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:40,689
of our people or just a power law and we
can contain eight or this little parts

148
00:21:40,690 --> 00:22:04,070
for creating one big jobs people not
know I will try to show your day

149
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:18,770
foreign minister device

150
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:44,030
if we repress

151
00:22:44,030 --> 00:23:05,059
I know a lot of different we can

152
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:54,269
so without implicating formation
malicious JavaScript

153
00:23:54,269 --> 00:24:25,440
and finally its control devices the
instruments as the administrator or

154
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:43,169
administrator can control through the
estimates it's a very you admitted for

155
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:49,859
example if employer moved their bra top
secret information arbitrator can send

156
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:55,049
SMS 0044

157
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:04,679
looking device for example provide
different type of calm and in for exist

158
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:14,839
different common for example why perot
or otherwise modify for applying new

159
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:31,950
policy for example etc so it looks like
as much for looking user and smiles

160
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:41,739
contains few parts remain part its
signature here so if we will send SMS

161
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:43,589
with signature

162
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:59,259
recline try to burn this is my client
may seem to the Sigma Xi you know for a

163
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:04,090
for a client control

164
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:10,750
the type of this mess will not show up
for the user so I thought the signature

165
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:19,690
by 64% vacations drink after that idea
of common and common name which will be

166
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:27,000
executed if we provide successful
notifications doing so the most

167
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,169
interesting part of this message of
course interrogations thing actually

168
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:44,250
question is is she a 256 but we should
know what exactly was hashed his

169
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,240
campaign through freemen well it's a lot
of mister Asian session

170
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,580
ClientID and transmitter eighty actually
transmitter aideed's just their writing

171
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:10,539
so we should know session blind lady and
surveyed a good session but if you try

172
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:21,070
to compare for example Android
application for we can see actually

173
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,320
tried to compare not only one try to
compare two different has the two and

174
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:37,700
the approach the first has our typical
which contains session planned idea

175
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:54,419
sarah brady but the second one itself
has vowed SessionID contains it contains

176
00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:05,379
ClientID twice separating so that means
we know only too well use ClientID and

177
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:13,998
severally so we don't know which we
don't need more certainly be very

178
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:26,409
corporate so the question is what about
client and server a be an attacker get

179
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:34,299
this without interpretation or not and
how it works

180
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:41,359
actually better idea or several can be
can be resolved without any indication

181
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:51,769
by sending any connection required to
the fire fighters in certain every

182
00:28:51,769 --> 00:29:00,059
response to the server information about
Arabia so what you need you just send

183
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:06,230
any requests with appropriate you get
information about charity so we need

184
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:20,009
only one client I D or we also
discovered ClientID is based on I'm so

185
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,289
if you know I'm

186
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:31,559
phone you can get in from generate
ClientID so that means if you know I'm

187
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:41,129
other phone you can create as controls
for other my question is how to get

188
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:48,860
permission about i mean actually

189
00:29:48,860 --> 00:30:01,280
a very big question but I decided a few
ways for program information disclosed

190
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,559
from some other application code is we
should stop all implored the wisest

191
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:16,149
course some of them can trust me to
mention about I'm on security should be

192
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:25,770
request the server and an attacker can
temper nation next one way to build this

193
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:31,480
into a secure area for example power
it's a certain herbal teas exactly this

194
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:43,610
way I will use on the root cause of the
phone is also predictable contains

195
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:57,949
certain number of part number etc so
company by a lot of France for the

196
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:09,480
employer and if I take you know what i
mean you can increase value for I mean

197
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,919
trying to brute force and you know as we
know messages do not show for the user

198
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:27,040
is how can be invisible for the user can
use a brush fourth and finally exists a

199
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:35,860
special devices different I'm a culture
of its special special devices which can

200
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:45,689
provide information about phone
connected to the

201
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:54,090
station so so that means I'm it's not a
problem now

202
00:31:54,090 --> 00:32:25,139
duma time

203
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:38,200
now we should get information about I
mean I said we can use our abilities

204
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:51,550
explored with malicious JavaScript
JavaScript code into admin panel and get

205
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:57,560
information about all connected for
information about any of this phone send

206
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,010
that information back to their tech

207
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:14,670
can rate get information about several
great different comments comments

208
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:28,580
get exercise to the bail or would you
rate again we can rate you can click

209
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,870
with 16 an hour per load

210
00:33:34,870 --> 00:34:11,118
waiting

211
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:33,980
get information about transmitter 81

212
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,350
we've had some s for protection

213
00:34:39,350 --> 00:35:13,250
and we have our Android who is this and
we can send them

214
00:35:13,250 --> 00:36:32,250
and

215
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:57,960
and generate random password for the
user for the lock screen enables the

216
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:05,090
lock screen that's how that's why after
the after the comment user do not know

217
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:10,620
possible and cannot unlock their phones
for example

218
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:39,520
looking again send us a message

219
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:50,550
but my favorite

220
00:37:50,550 --> 00:38:10,210
wipe comment

221
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:27,170
we just send information from the phone
was what it was and shooting down so

222
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:38,630
very interesting and I think if someone
from top management of big international

223
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:46,190
company was will be surprised if in one
day we'll get the type of customers and

224
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,880
also mention about

225
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:59,230
company-owned formation about critical
document on their porn will be wiped so

226
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:06,530
that's how it works

227
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,930
presentation

228
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:16,310
of course a close responsibilities for
your system if you should install

229
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:27,560
whatsapp in all these pipes but the
conclusion is four different enterprise

230
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:42,860
solution securities should be the main
things got even disappear 48 solution

231
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:51,660
which protect user data which showed now
protect data critical date of companies

232
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:58,690
but even into security solution exists
this type of leader bill DeWeese allowed

233
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:05,890
an attacker to compromise company
information for this company that's why

234
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:15,509
companies should be very careful when
they try to implement different security

235
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:26,000
to security solutions so if you working
bee company please do not forget about

236
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:38,710
get about security assessment and sit
around and do not buy any junk solution

237
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:44,300
which some guys try to sell you thank
you very much
