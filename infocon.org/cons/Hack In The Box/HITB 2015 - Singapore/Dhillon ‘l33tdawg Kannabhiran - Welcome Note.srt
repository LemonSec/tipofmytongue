1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:20,900
we don't really like to give back to the
community which is why we had a CFP

2
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,080
voting voting by the attendees and you
also notice on your badge like some

3
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,240
color codes so we actually ask you guys
to pick the talks that you are both

4
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,630
interested in and it's a way for a bit
of a passive networking so we don't use

5
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,079
a speeding in a bad place for like look
around the guys that have the same color

6
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,820
good and you have a common interest also
for those who actually voted during the

7
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,929
CFB for the talks about the speakers
that your message that the media during

8
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,380
the lunch today you'll actually be
sitting down with them and Hira chance

9
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,719
to catch up with them and the idea
behind all of this is mainly because you

10
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,589
know when when it's an incident and
stuff isn't working so well you don't

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,390
normally go to your vendors will help
you actually call up your friends right

12
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,310
