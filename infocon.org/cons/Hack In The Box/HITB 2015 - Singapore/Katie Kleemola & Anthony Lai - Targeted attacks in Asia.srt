1
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:21,789
and I'm a researcher at citizen that
which is academic research group based

2
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:28,800
out of the Munk school of global affairs
at the University of Toronto so that

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,279
likes to study what we call the
intersection of human rights and

4
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,809
technology and so one of our main
interest is looking at targeted attacks

5
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:45,530
against civil society organizations and
then after bus and so this started back

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:53,440
in about 2009 when the Loudoun orville
new foods now a prior I discovered what

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,440
was dubbed as net which was one of the
first documented major cyber cyber

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,099
espionage networks and this was
initially found three investigating

9
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:12,859
claims targeted attacks against Tibetan
organizations so this is often referred

10
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:19,429
to as apt or an advanced persistent
threat and so in this case these attacks

11
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:24,450
are very very highly targeted against
civil society groups and pretty much

12
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,380
face them and this kind of constant
stream and they're particularly

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,298
vulnerable often because groups have low
resources for example they don't often

14
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:41,479
have dedicated ITC to help them out and
put it take care of that so one thing

15
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:48,439
that we did do is last year we publish
it was the strongest research report

16
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,949
over it was a study of about four years
and looked at attacks against 10 civil

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,730
society groups but so sorry that was not
targeted threats done that

18
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:09,600
and so I'm just gonna go through a few
different areas so as I said a lot of

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,790
the started with attacks on that end
this is kind of people I've known about

20
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,989
the longest since it's not very visible
sorry this is kinda have typically what

21
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:31,990
we see we'll see these emails being sent
to people and they kind of follow up in

22
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,120
the same format where they'll say that
they're from someone who is within the

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,040
community or someone who someone may now
I was pretending to be and things and

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,910
they might reference often you'll see
references to events like

25
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,940
self-immolations also much 10:39
uprising anniversary of the uprising

26
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,410
we'll just see these huge amount of
emails coming and where they often have

27
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:12,060
an attachment and a plea to kind of open
it and these attachments will contain

28
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,030
materials that have been repurposed from
either mailing lists or news or often if

29
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,440
one person has been compromised then
we'll see their personal example

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,150
being used to try to infect others and
so often these attachments historically

31
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,930
they've all been using Microsoft Word
Finder abilities and despite the fact

32
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,470
that I can win this advanced persistent
threat people think advanced it's more

33
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,700
persistent and so will typically see the
same SEBI is being used over and over

34
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,820
again even after they patched you don't
really need this kind of sexy o'day to

35
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:00,079
actually compromise people if you just
keep on going after them so recently we

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,250
did see a better but still using these
kind of same tactics having this

37
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,210
attachment tending to be from a real
group but they started being a

38
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:17,140
PowerPoint slide just simply like thats
and San Ramon roadies I came out and

39
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,320
really use a package manager and
essentially what you can do as you could

40
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,340
imagine they are remote install file and
Jeff that was actually an executable

41
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,560
originally these were being loaded them
to start later the abilities were

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,800
embedded executables that were then
copied over the temp folders so you

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
don't actually have to worry about
firewall rules trying to stop the

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,750
download of executables the primary
factor for this was like I said this

45
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,390
PowerPoint presentations because you can
save them as a PowerPoint show and I

46
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:58,340
just that and then they would
automatically launch and durability

47
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,780
would be triggered and so this was in
actually any sort of it was just a

48
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,840
larger car which meant that you could
kind of see this seamlessly the sort of

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,549
transition and this is actually just
again repurpose content from a major to

50
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,870
an organization and so this was a little
problematic too because typically people

51
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,680
would be told hey watch out for a
program rushing

52
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,889
watch out for if you see what kind of
liquor and then reopen with different

53
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:35,020
title for the document has been going on
for so long with it

54
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,460
community they had developed all these
sort of training campaigns for example

55
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,900
this major one was detached from
attachments with the idea that you just

56
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,270
didn't open attachments and didn't use
attachments to send things you could

57
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:55,880
prevent a huge portion of the tax and so
this was really trying to aim to get

58
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,120
people to change their habits and change
their behavior but of course as people

59
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,310
change their behavior the tactics of the
attackers as well so in this case it was

60
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:18,599
dark and getting people taking advantage
of the fact that they might implicitly

61
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:25,990
trust this kind of covered sorry cloud
service instead of taking into account

62
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,190
like even if they don't want something
from Google Drive it can still be

63
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,660
malicious

64
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,990
and so particularly in that community
technology is this way that they can

65
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:46,110
enact connected people beyond borders
and it's something like as they say it

66
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:58,010
can be sending people to jail and so I
talks within the community will see this

67
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,800
sort of different campaigns and one
thing we talked about so-called actors

68
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
and so we try to look at how can we
identify connections between different

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,550
campaigns whether they're in different
regions or organizations so one thing

70
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:19,150
that people the class is our families
not always be the best indicator that

71
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,179
there's this sort of common enemy
because source code for iraq may be

72
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,270
publicly available or maybe being sold

73
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,520
typically in asia we see home-grown
around in different areas like Syria

74
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,299
will often see repurpose crime or in
other regions will see commercial

75
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,750
malware such as Ben Fisher hacking team
being used so one other thing that we

76
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,870
look at his command and control
infrastructure which is kinda just this

77
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:55,410
clear clear that there is the same actor
again going after various groups and so

78
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,260
we also look at the contextual
information what is being used in this

79
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:08,010
attack is it coming from what is obvious
source in center using similar tactics

80
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:14,810
and so I just wanted to quickly actually
go over our family that we do often see

81
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:22,300
and it's called plugs and so in this
case it's one of the more advanced drops

82
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:32,020
that we see being used in Asia and it's
been used for a long time in 2012

83
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,020
particularly when it involved they
reported that they actually identify the

84
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:47,360
creator based on things for example like
the PDP PDP PDP and so it kinda

85
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,550
disappeared for a little bit off the
radar and then later the same hour and

86
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,060
like him back to us with all the
identifying information described as

87
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,540
well as getting rid of debug messages
and things like this is a demo version

88
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,750
and so like actually I called you out

89
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,180
loading which is pretty similar to
jackie and so you pretty much have a

90
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,939
trio components where you have a sign
little an executable and so this way you

91
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,630
do have the side of trust executable
that is running and then it's just

92
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,510
simply I'd also surprised about it we'll
see lol and then the other thing it does

93
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,050
is it has this encrypted binary file
that contains the actual payload and so

94
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:39,189
then it is never actually been there it
simply in memory and so as analysis of

95
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,910
this right has been published then we'll
see things for example when it decrypt

96
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:48,420
data memory a kind of strips out
information from the header in this case

97
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:56,089
thankfully interest by Ben and the pea
coat and tie dye on its fine like acts

98
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,030
as these kind of typical features like a
keylogger taking screenshots in Iraq

99
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,160
files and it also has a lot of features
like you can have tons of

100
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,089
command-and-control servers with this
one is taking down then you can always

101
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:17,300
use another it also often uses DNA for
example just Google's is a good one that

102
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,530
way if it is being used against an
organisation what you can do is simply

103
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,329
avoid detection through their lives and
then also has multiple options for

104
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,400
communication protocols and so often we
see does

105
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,910
loading the favorite target for this is
my preference maybe funders

106
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:45,000
in this case this is a secure and we
actually saw this is not against the law

107
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,780
but also in Hong Kong and so this case
we kind of overlap we're back in the

108
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,390
spring we had actually the exact same
being used against any group and that

109
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:07,880
was with the repurposed earlier as well
as individuals in Hong Kong and Anthony

110
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,040
its collective heart attacks in Hong
Kong after me but so this is just one

111
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,839
example the slight slight recovery
purposes and then in the email it would

112
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:27,660
be impersonating the system for
membership a member of the Legislative

113
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:36,050
Council gave this presentation and so if
you're not actually aware these attacks

114
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,680
being aimed actually it can be really
really easy just to simply go okay this

115
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:50,050
is a legend and so in this case this is
very clearly the exact same this is the

116
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:57,870
same threat actor but we do see some
comment on keez against attacks and so

117
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:05,350
in that case it's really debate about
this is how much sharon is going up

118
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,680
across groups

119
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,149
is simply one first time flies that
actor is they're sharing of tools of

120
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:18,920
tactics and so well our focus is on
andrea we've actually seen overlap

121
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,270
between documented attacks against
industry our guys as well as government

122
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:28,880
and so one of these popular just
Rodriguez has actually been energy

123
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,360
sector and so perhaps unsurprisingly
because of that we have now started to

124
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,950
see attacks in Burma which is quite new
and so again this may be a little

125
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,600
surprised because there's just such a
huge transformation going on there and

126
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,110
the country is very rich in natural
resources and there's also have

127
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,279
investment from China and so a lot of
NGOs are concerned over these

128
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,310
development projects or the
environmental and human rights impact

129
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:11,050
and so we start to see again sorry these
emails are very clear but in this case

130
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,209
there's this email that was sent to
environmental group is working on issues

131
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:21,500
related and it was I had to redact it
was actually pretending to be someone

132
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:30,020
within the group and was just
referencing news article about the

133
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:43,180
special economic zone and Japanese firms
operate on it and so in this case does

134
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,300
have a link to a Google document which
is again the same sort of tactic being

135
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,240
used against other groups

136
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:58,510
you kind of get around education
awareness plans that I do it

137
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:06,339
campaigns that have been adapting and so
in this case it was really kind of this

138
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,830
weird roundabout thing we're headed to
go drive with actually linked file that

139
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:26,040
was supposed to look like a patent and
then I had just to download provider and

140
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,920
so this again with the same family that
we've seen in various attacks all over

141
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:45,199
which perhaps unsurprising this time
they were using the executable

142
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,220
there's there are and so kind of
underwear the connections are with other

143
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:03,790
campaigns because one we saw that was
using a related c2 to the sample it was

144
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:12,569
also using a revoked certificate samples
are any one using a revoked certificate

145
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,960
against Japan organizations and also
exactly the same time all the summer

146
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,220
we've started seeing this year drew
large volume of attacks in burma that

147
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,310
all sorted using the same our families
and started making increase to friends

148
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,000
and doing a little bit of research here
and the general reaction was oh dear

149
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,940
lord everyone is owned and a lot of this
comes from the fact that even for

150
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,220
example them I'm our government website
was compromised and so they started

151
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:53,970
serving up an hour and what I thought
was pretty interesting was very now says

152
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,560
was actually globalized recognized
recognized organization in the whaling

153
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,560
industry

154
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,000
I hear it was again there's just not
we're being hosted on the site and saw

155
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,300
that it was actually again it was plugs
but it was the same exact same an

156
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:25,229
executable that we saw being used
against our groups

157
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,110
and so we've actually just kind of
continued to see attacks related to

158
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,070
Burma not just with projects but also
with other similarly our families that

159
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:46,550
we've seen against the two organizations
I'm so considering all that are going on

160
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,890
there it's probably somewhere where
we'll continue to see it happens I was

161
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,790
related to current events into media
going on there so we just actually

162
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:05,359
recently put out a blog post today
giving more details about campaigns and

163
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,810
we also have several blood post to
specifically about that ban Khong

164
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:26,609
connection and so I guess I think it's
fabulous become more about Funcom

165
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:36,600
because my stuff

166
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:49,120
show more case study should ease myself
I had an eye on the web I focus on my

167
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,260
happiest time I I like to help those
democrats both democrats to analyze

168
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,200
those samples because no one willing to
volunteer to do this kind of work i mean

169
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:11,730
a nice work and also done both of like
like labor labor Association ngos Human

170
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,440
Rights Association stay with us for an
artists so this is our own here and also

171
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,890
made and I focus on doing my part time
PhD in my various school of science

172
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,809
technology due to some machining

173
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:33,220
attacker propounding attribution and
attribution and for a parade i mean they

174
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,929
time I'm it's very interesting if I'm
not working as an aging company is a

175
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:43,960
column sec to do some bad monitoring and
also the anti-dole solutions so that's

176
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,390
why I know station right I got little
bit pressure from ICO but I don't care

177
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,770
no because I'm represent the exam today

178
00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:06,200
ok let's go ahead and 45 seconds war
machine

179
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,950
criminal national secret I don't have
any spy gear Spy everywhere no problem

180
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:22,400
and ok case study about apt against Hong
Kong observation against people in a

181
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,500
political movement and against the
website then this is now

182
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,930
observation you expect any packing
square I want to press up 79 that you

183
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,330
could go up in the room right because
you could from the sum from you chipped

184
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:45,770
in and about what is right and also
katie has already apart on those

185
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:55,760
projects and explain away the pain
behind observation actually fall for us

186
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:04,830
sorry for the past 18 months and
including our business scope is very

187
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:11,129
good football including NGOs democrats
University even very tinny charity

188
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,590
companies the ass too are you going to
fix our computers are sorry we just

189
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:24,959
analyzed attack on the face but we will
i get for this organization what they i

190
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,080
mean who is attacker we don't know who
is behind but we know that they really

191
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,960
like have a very good point dates came
as US when they are on saturday on the

192
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,880
sunday we didn't receive any attack and
very incidents if you're hitting some

193
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,820
China or days but some soda national
days in the process of October or even

194
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,730
some golden week of the shopping we
didn't receive any attack for past three

195
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:00,820
years so I don't know who is behind but
I I know they need holidays alright

196
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,659
alive as well and we just know that use
the Chinese characters and we didn't

197
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:14,280
capture and last mouth like rats
collapse this kind of superpower agency

198
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,999
to know every part of the China

199
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:21,579
copy every week and you know just how
obvious you know that's why we can't do

200
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:26,759
it like that and also we are not as
Indian like we could get this kind of

201
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:32,479
funny string when we could know this is
from the first and second department and

202
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:37,709
further division wherever brother so
before the apt one report and friendly

203
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:43,999
printing a report about apt one other
comment so that's why we can't justify

204
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:52,169
who is if you ask me who is behind us I
can tell you and we are the most of them

205
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:57,489
put a c2 Mbps serving Hong Kong and
second line of the internet service for

206
00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:02,349
wider isn't quite fun actually today
that we got law enforcement Gaza from

207
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:08,678
Hong Kong but he's not working in that
division but anyway then BB port many

208
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:15,849
years ago many years we've reported a
concert they simply ok we got a case ok

209
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:22,529
then we took the undersea 2003 just
unplug the machine that's a finished

210
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:28,589
case coast and I are you going to see
two are now I'm sorry that this is not

211
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:33,938
how the police and the police police are
out there I P is an ongoing but when you

212
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:38,519
go to the other place than the surface
not there is our pantry is in mainland

213
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:49,719
China the case also coast so we are long
but that's why the artist to artist and

214
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:56,279
some even or but righty i mean democracy
and other people police and say are you

215
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:05,710
losing any money now so we can accept a
case ok I want to do that

216
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:13,049
ok well as their favorite a low they
like a lot like people immigration

217
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:21,190
immigration to get a lot a lot of hours
poison ivy China may want so if there's

218
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:26,059
an operator in this room I suggest you
talk about with about this 2014 the top

219
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:35,178
administration choose for your next a
low right because you're low people pay

220
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,000
for it

221
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,779
like many people ok don't use poison ivy
is too boring or just simply refers to

222
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,500
top one is better more commercial one
much much better if their operators here

223
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:56,309
and certain also observed a single
server for talk attack I found a

224
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:02,190
reference to other people in hong kong
they don't use the single server 45

225
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,200
purpose

226
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,309
shows something but some of them and
they used to force me to against like

227
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:13,870
legislative counselor of the films they
used for fishing or fishing other

228
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:21,750
apartment or phishing site looks like
this like a business when they accept

229
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:28,830
order and they got ok the project's cost
money is collected and they got another

230
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:33,668
business is doing fishing banning the
use the same server compared with the C

231
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:40,220
two other attackers will you really have
a dedicated target will use the same

232
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:47,690
support you plan to put the server as a
stealthy so I find it there bro I should

233
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,399
think they don't want government so that
money would not be so stupid you know

234
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,489
Chinese Japanese mary's mother so that's
because I don't think it's one Chinese

235
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,870
government is from the new business
agency to do either they put the same

236
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,370
server to do different purpose and now
people to know that you didn't work

237
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,908
right to disclose the city or GPS

238
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:17,159
ok we got some green dot no worries
don't feel asleep here

239
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:25,519
ok pieces my grading I see JFK are
different attack and cancer by both ok

240
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,129
level 0

241
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:33,029
defacement and phishing site they simply
just because fishing side that had to

242
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:38,239
print web site because the problem is a
lot of ngos a lot of democratic parties

243
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:43,200
they didn't have fought people to do
their profession design enterprise

244
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,210
management on the idea and is simply
just use PHP pocketbook educators desk

245
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,590
and he's like my secure victory over
death definition and put it on the

246
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:59,988
complement system ok well but didn't do
any passion and also the left at the

247
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:06,840
percentages represent how many cases RBC
to analyze this kind of attack never

248
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,959
want putting an executable and frame
inning and Akamai sites come to my site

249
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,229
is common for for for that because

250
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:22,330
to such as horrible they don't they face
it is simply put a link is a credible 22

251
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,649
in fast to spread out to play low
through those to those supporters oppo

252
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:32,809
people we visit the website ok no one
ever to send emails from Google Mail

253
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:41,239
Gmail and drop off a you have got some
documents that are you human form for

254
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:46,519
you to fill in and say hi did some
secret source of the documents you need

255
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,609
to download from the chopper from the
Google now and also supports Google

256
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,658
chief administrator asked you to reset a
password they use different techniques

257
00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:03,450
very funny you signify the Chinese Hong
Kong is traditional Chinese English if

258
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,149
you do a more professional operator its
new treaties with Chinese sometimes so

259
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:14,309
that we can use this kind of phishing
emails but we found a lot because it

260
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,379
uses Google Yahoo to go and top US
israeli heart attack where they are

261
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:21,760
ready come from but I got some tricks to
know where they come from

262
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,960
level 3 sending malicious attachment to
exploit I suppose is the same as Katie

263
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,290
the cases cover in different political
attack packets about and poison ivy and

264
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:43,970
robert was being see something light up
before sending more customized I mean I

265
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:51,870
support it and some encryption he likes
a lot okay I sometimes I find one time I

266
00:27:51,870 --> 00:28:01,399
found myself cause this is pure X 964 is
the key

267
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,160
but I'll I didn't notice a report last
week because of a few years ago but they

268
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,600
like to use the extra and for those
customers encryption but for that and

269
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,550
also I just 11 to two samples but in
taiwan a lot a lot of customized

270
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:25,690
encryption and is a heart attack by the
antivirus software and there were five

271
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,610
malicious mobile application I will
explain this in details for espionage

272
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,520
purpose I got a real case study and
there were six is about

273
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,889
against our sites for this about what
website I'm in trouble already finish

274
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,880
our case study with a professor from
information system in Hong Kong

275
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,620
University of Science Technology and
also refused two offers on the copper is

276
00:28:51,620 --> 00:29:03,020
our our group members to consider is how
I cut if I actually coming

277
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,110
straight level five and six so that you
can no worries and revolutionary

278
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:15,709
commitment but you know because some
kind of movement so yesterday some

279
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,450
friends asked me to be careful about
umbrella movement but anyway if you go

280
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,840
to Beijing China don't carry any yellow
amber yellow things or even stickers or

281
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,750
otherwise it will be checked by them and
say hey are you involved in this kind of

282
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:38,570
movement so I i'm serious so that's why
then the current samples accurate in

283
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:45,300
this case study 1 the pic mobile
application and actually this

284
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:54,050
organization no problem hope you guys
doing such kind of how many people are

285
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,889
pissing people how to coding and
programming in hong kong but very

286
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,600
strange is that one day they got SMS
message sent to different audience and

287
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,800
say hey I pissed on its application and
CO and you could help coordinate occupy

288
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,780
central that means the umbrella movement
and also prefer to work with different

289
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:23,370
hope for educators and method for
analysis as well as win when we got this

290
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:29,280
number i mean this message check out and
joined a peace sign tobacco for

291
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:36,020
education for the Coordination of Occupy
central ok maybe separate enjoyable

292
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,480
sometimes then maybe you just get over
it but it was very fun yes it's not

293
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,240
received

294
00:30:47,240 --> 00:31:00,400
midnight its me see if I mean that the
idea is when during the evening time

295
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:08,220
from six to ten more or different
occupying areas for for beating

296
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,179
forecasts of gathering for discussion
and every night

297
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:19,750
not just one time we also by this time
of year of time and all this message

298
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:26,840
when the people more people group that
in occupation areas they saw this

299
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,949
message is not send it by morning time
early morning time no real nice I didn't

300
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:44,610
mention here but my slide but this is
how they do it very considerate of the

301
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,520
we often work to the Occupy central
areas that this conversation for us to

302
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,970
have a free application ok what you
still inside for the application

303
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:06,059
possible this year and actually four
hours talking about but they're

304
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:11,610
interesting is that they will produce
that happened on a PK powers attempt to

305
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:18,270
try to sleep and other message right but
right now in hong kong there's no one

306
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,460
who's this week so that's the point

307
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:28,410
looks like they just be used to coat

308
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:36,230
and capturing outgoing call to my phone
and I mean on the receiver I mean

309
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:43,800
competition POW's we find that they hope
hope and we call them to this letter

310
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:55,530
dated comes up we want our extension and
here this is the coat ok and put it here

311
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:03,610
for this is output be calling part
because the outgoing call for that

312
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:14,100
capturing and save it here at home
directory up and that the path the kind

313
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:21,010
of we want to put a recording under this
folder in hong kong people at Target

314
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:31,930
happy we got this kind of application ok
is interesting is using BrdU a secure

315
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:39,480
location and try to figure out what is
your location but if they do more if the

316
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,580
operator to more recent research should
be say hey I do it now

317
00:33:46,580 --> 00:34:00,689
Hong Kong so good research here so they
leaked their identity but that's the

318
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:07,549
point I used to do to to mention about
prime location

319
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,389
findings

320
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:17,490
IP is still working so they're still
alive but I didn't report any policy

321
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:25,109
because I want me to stay alive it's
more fun than you could I be addressed

322
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:29,710
is how cold in this room service as well
and this one I would pop out details

323
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,230
about this IP address is aspect to be
the series over but sometimes comes in

324
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:42,199
sometimes life sometimes not like a
sister to be able to stop by Nasir and

325
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,770
other than when you look at the coop
extra couple go to start new consumer

326
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,839
credit history

327
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:56,828
contest baby as a magistrate actually we
got the whole application become hard

328
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:04,030
and put put under natural account is
open to public if you are interested I

329
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:13,609
was actually linked to study the dish i
mean the application this nice than they

330
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:21,509
like to put out a plea there so I tried
to crack the password every time I see

331
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,260
this I would try to crack it but it's
very difficult you know muscle strength

332
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:38,339
I just hit with a very funny screen you
know is there any finished now the party

333
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:44,720
is about the people just about
application for me I observed the one of

334
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,359
the IP address I mention this one

335
00:35:50,360 --> 00:36:03,910
10 11 or 1.54% and when I check out this
is bad for the 2014 17 September ok this

336
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:11,319
is a corporation we ICP das easy to the
IP address list with software that IP

337
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,820
address I mention and you can see what
you do officer is to changing all the

338
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,380
time after the other than the data for
year of six months and 14 in the

339
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:31,080
preparation of every used his IP again
ok to be soft difference en

340
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:40,980
domains and then an awful lot of quick
and I'll show you this is the Sprint

341
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,940
from passive totals rank up to brandon
has different doc rhetoric of CNN in

342
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:55,320
this year in July and August and how
about recently just two days days ago

343
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:03,440
when we started this and also does some
fishing sites like match.com Katie we

344
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,270
all dat we are in the early early
October then I would like to reduce

345
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:17,160
didn't use the same IP address or the
e-mail address for the single purpose of

346
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,220
attack attack

347
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:22,509
sometimes they need to business today
except different assignment and

348
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:28,890
operational mission to other work
because but now the Legislative Council

349
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,990
on holidays so when the holidays they
also need to get more business when I

350
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:42,089
get a kiss or so need to do some general
one ok but that's my observation there

351
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:49,210
like it's very tough you know doing this
kind of operator ok for this IP address

352
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:59,880
is always in the correct IP addresses in
Peoria and also find here

353
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,630
photo there is mention about the samples

354
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:15,210
the samples here you can see there's a
key under this IP address before back to

355
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:23,020
the tune of the 2012 June this year as I
mentioned in the member because about

356
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:29,009
this lie about level 02 level six then
it looks like they are willing to using

357
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:35,570
the same trick to back to this level 12
put out executable and other compromised

358
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,930
website copy of the people to do it
through the hidden meaning or somethin

359
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:47,250
my friend so you could find it and I
suspect when you turn it is israelis and

360
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:53,330
simply hope those hope method is like a
key locking as well and send it back to

361
00:38:53,330 --> 00:39:00,529
the same server with the hopes that
policy and budget is very limited they

362
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,720
just open different posture receive and
send up a low so that's why we need to

363
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,899
show sympathy ok

364
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,010
this is the case that he won perhaps a
case study too and I think if you are

365
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,099
living in Hong Kong or pay a lot of
attention to Hong Kong aches this is

366
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:28,119
really impressive one because this is
not about malicious attachment this is

367
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,680
about distributable out of service
attack that it's not just last 12 days

368
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,919
is not about money

369
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,529
oK so that's why I would let you know
more details in this and for me to race

370
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:46,670
repins participate as a bunch of their
party to the punishment has 24 they're

371
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:52,010
looking web hosting website and also to
give the comment about instant response

372
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:58,890
one or one of our roads our fellows in
the board and he is responsible for you

373
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:06,779
during the attack traffic which is the
internet service providers ok so he's

374
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:13,539
also one of the company to undertake
protection and he does attention as well

375
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:19,529
for this or by the background you could
go to disrupt this public sly for that

376
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:25,650
but as I said I I work with Rico offers
to the case study the case that he's

377
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,730
already have a job and confirmed by the
Hong Kong University right now is we

378
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:36,200
will send you have a business will
because I I don't think right now the

379
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,689
University of California Press showcase
at about this time a large scale of it

380
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:52,980
ok this time I am NOT going food for the
for the Harris they attack Iran outcome

381
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,730
and PLP is to put books is the rep

382
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,880
the booking website booking website
owner or they're organized organizer

383
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,839
their response is from 214

384
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,859
important of June actually that he'd
also attack against the couch where the

385
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:19,828
water quality and service covering more
surveys of the race for the domain for

386
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:27,290
the pope to educate right along the
fence and also poked

387
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:34,579
organizer also add 50 free and also
ended up being a service provider for

388
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:43,920
more better specs resources to defense
that you don't attack 15 and 16 when

389
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,650
that happens on WoW looks like you have
a very strong defense they tried to

390
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:54,700
initiate already initiated 100 billion
yen us with questions today Ms on this

391
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:00,859
is not my sometimes you can check back
to the digital attack map if they are

392
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:05,710
not quite check out this kind of
historical records from this on the

393
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:14,609
Google digitized map and Amazon say hey
now stop it you're willing to me which

394
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,970
is charged EUR worries more shuttle
money but you give us 100 billion yen as

395
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:28,299
we go again and and also the CDN service
and your domain is famous Hong Kong and

396
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,690
also under attack and with the picture
of it at 10 gigabit per second

397
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:40,400
ok because he could wash and fruit of a
traffic but you have no more resources

398
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,490
to their existing crimes including Yahoo
so drop we also can't take any the party

399
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:56,100
in the party so the only guys only agent
want us to deploy

400
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:02,089
only for metal prints but we limit our
service but you know what is charged is

401
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:09,050
just about the only child about 200 West
or even got huge

402
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:19,240
I was 17 ok that hackers you know they
are very committed people initiated yet

403
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,589
as an entity does attack but the picture
of it is about 150 gigabit per second

404
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:30,970
unit is cumshot pic is about in hong
kong mister one word of a night of the

405
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:38,700
traffic about watching the World Cup but
all the time the three days we suffer

406
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:46,839
this one discount warning about her and
was the outcome looks like I still

407
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,950
member we are very frustrated with just
being hit with punched but no no other

408
00:43:52,950 --> 00:44:01,890
message our last report the police but
police say hey you know any money now we

409
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,650
are sorry but that is it

410
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:10,490
China China Telecom for investigation

411
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,680
ok but you have

412
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,390
announced two weeks but the organization
very very very smart this time ok

413
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:27,190
extent of time and even your website we
got people that means that you simply

414
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:34,410
just gearing up to insert a paper right
and also them cultural project your

415
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:39,450
copper project is about a lot more for
kept for dedicated nameservers to

416
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:47,970
increase the defense right by the
blanking the story and get that have to

417
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,450
find that we still can't get done

418
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:57,669
website the pope's organizers extended
period of time they do the last resort

419
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,420
on chanti like a final battle 300
gigabit per second he does that had

420
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,230
taken place before the voting because
the working person not yet officially

421
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,470
they're free DNS profession
antipersonnel track of what has 100

422
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,560
million staying at her perceptions

423
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:23,470
DNS product with 128 MB per second DNS
requests also there's a one attack we

424
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:29,640
have we didn't mention is about as a
self service which will be negotiations

425
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,240
attack is a new attack by gulf Air metal
prints poster in the traitor and say try

426
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,790
to do a lot of renegotiation for the
service which is a pretty for that

427
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:48,710
reason they master there was that had a
more and also they initiate a lot of

428
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,390
large amounts of random and no
assistance request you know operator is

429
00:45:54,390 --> 00:46:00,230
a business agency they need to get the
money they may be simply deposit 40% to

430
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:06,620
70% of the money so neither show some
work people you know this is like a

431
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:14,580
crazy to see whether to bring it done
but for how come the counter medication

432
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,529
is transfer some powers to something
service providers and use any concepts

433
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:24,560
of September consumption attack and how
could you not widest some rest

434
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,600
audience response and widest

435
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:36,690
extent I could go up against you for the
defense and also we also the pope also

436
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:42,190
organizer updated and reputation to
minimize depends dependence on the cloud

437
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:48,580
hosting and water system around a crop
right and at the same time in the

438
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:55,420
morning time but in the past hour on the
same day the operator is not in fact

439
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:01,660
here for the attack with the capital
money to deposit the more money we tried

440
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:10,629
to bring down if they are in the Chinese
University of Hong Kong once you've

441
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:17,780
brought you want to assist or even
including your weed idk

442
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:24,230
organization education no one could
assess but they failed of course because

443
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:31,000
chk greatest problem but you see how
committed are how crazy they are they

444
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,300
they want to break down there is no
money para website information nope just

445

448
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:07,410
really get better

449
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,770
remaining money for the project they
have no more ideas they sent out some

450
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:20,800
emails SMS service to because SMS usage
report and even send out some because

451
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,390
some fishing website I put books

452
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:30,029
underscore s of course this is easily
attacked and brought on by Hong Kong

453
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:38,500
Hong Kong domain registry before this
case what you learn i think is much more

454
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,760
important more serious than than the one
about those malicious attachment for my

455
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,720
handling for my handles incident before
because the disparate 14 days

456
00:48:50,720 --> 00:49:24,700
attack of this morning

457
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:31,310
server is already deployed their
infrastructure is already boarded air

458
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:40,200
and also some attacks from China I B
also from Hong Kong and also to server

459
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:47,149
topic no one stopped to stop about his
country crest know that's why I asked

460
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:58,359
questions too can you handle this kind
of attack in your home run it's not

461
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:03,040
about for my handling some commercial
case of a DDoS attack or something some

462

going to ask you to pay me for six
thousand RMB ok I get your free days

465

contact the customer service area and

466
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:34,579

467
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:40,980
commercial 10 honest but there they told
me that I we are not attacking you

468
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:47,260
you're super entry code trading company
but once we attack you BB to get more

469
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,710
resources get more zombies attack you we

471

attack but here the pope no one call us
email no one has a security or you know

472
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:12,020
we can ask them to stop the campaign
money to settle the things but the

473
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,579
structure that infrastructure services
here is there already so that's the

474
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:16,910
point

475
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:24,379
can you imagine this kind of company or
agency was behind this kind of resources

476
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,030
to launch discover tech for 14 days

477
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,280
door entry or something

478
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,860
infrastructure critical infrastructure
and I can you translate that of a true

479
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:45,830
this is very scary remember this server

480
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:52,560
I mean this machine I mean this system
just a booking website is about the

481
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,020
website for the hong kong people to work
for the next to vote for their

482
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:03,440
preference for the how to what is the
past proposal to let the next chief

483
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,550
executive only there's nothing during
where you're working for anyone but

484
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:13,830
looking for a passport proposal next
chief executive vice president and

485
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,630
there's no credit card information

486
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:19,860
Hong Kong identity card information no
address no privacy information because

487
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:25,070
all of them will be stored in the
database and encrypt so they can't do it

488
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:33,240
for any benefits for that so it's very
inside I want you guys to know about it

489
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:49,680
ok this is my and not make history for
any questions I'm thankful to our

490
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,169
citizens and also Katie also work with
me

491
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,750
together to this discount delivered this
kind of attack attack

492
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:04,590
operate you enjoy it because I hope that
you'll also pipe also talked about

493
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:09,330
different political parties are
supportable attack projects at the same

494
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:13,660
time for us to meet and deliver some
kind of case study in hong kong how to a

495
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,450
different tack

496
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:20,259
touch then different dimension of
prospective for you guys for reference

497
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:26,250
instead of just mention or just
malicious attachment though any

498
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,880
questions for us

499
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,730
but I suppose I need to promote a
citizen and as well in the city and that

500
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:40,600
there's the rub cycle of prop message I
learned a lot from there and the

501
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:47,920
reported publish regularly then that's
very very nicely with and call up to go

502
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,770
and indeed house is very nice thank you
