1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,010
oh sorry for a bit of delay but then I

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,350
think we can go eat I'm standing between

3
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,560
your coffee breaks so yeah I need to get

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,660
very quick right so for the topic for

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,490
today are going to test it on reverse

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,000
engineering Android an hour you know

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,950
really talked about in attacking on

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,350
android android application but are we

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,510
focus on how you can read with all this

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,670
stuff right regardless of ideas you're

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,470
running on App or running on as a

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,510
malware read as a metal song ish or

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,640
within the Android comment how we can

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,890
reverse engineer it so a little bit

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,990
about myself I work for service feeding

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,270
Malaysia which is far out and the mighty

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,120
department which is lead a group of pubs

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,390
Mallory Citigroup our agenda I'm going

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,850
to cover on the intro about what is you

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,830
know Derek what is a JVM and so on and

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,259
so forth and a little bit about Android

22
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,390
an hour and of course about what is the

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,090
in essential tools or skill that you

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,890
need to know when you're dealing with

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,439
the Android reverse engineering and of

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,880
course we're going to show a little bit

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,090
about at least for sample on the malware

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,909
on Android malware and of course we're

29
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:24,930
going to touch a little bit about a

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,060
challenge an issue when when we're

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,470
dealing with the rivers engineering on a

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,780
android platform and of course the last

33
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,330
one is about our conclusion to Android

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,860
malware so this is your Android malware

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,600
so Android malware statistic this is a

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,180
subtext across the release by a guy I

37
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,000
mean you take a look at this web page so

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,430
he did some like a monthly analysis for

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,590
each a new sample point in the one so

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,580
roughly you see a lot of simple phone in

41
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,370
the wise walk or I'll see a lot consider

42
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,720
that the new kind of platform for the

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,790
mobile thing it's not really

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,350
legitimately you want to compare

45
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,500
platform on Android and Windows for

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,598
example okay so this is kind of a

47
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,330
statistic on the Mel watt Android

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,900
malware and then the news is pretty much

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,049
everywhere nowadays year we have one

50
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,730
year here you have a turd inspire you

51
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,550
Yocum

52
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,320
me pretty much everywhere nowadays all

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,770
right so I'm going now it's pretty much

54
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,170
a master's piece of code infection

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,180
method of Android will be different than

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,730
typical windows infection right one of

57
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,280
it is using a lot of things that we saw

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
is bimodal modified are you know doing

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,380
somebody figured modification or doing

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,840
some retake aging to the legitimate

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,970
application such as like Jeanne me and

62
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,280
Jim draw pretty much for example unsub

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,680
all the latest one is Nikki Nikki

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,900
experiments and so forth and normally

65
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,790
all these are you know repackage

66
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,040
application would be uploaded to the

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,090
third part to pocket hosting or upper

68
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,200
back to the market okay and the second

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,910
one is probably by exploiting Android

70
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,760
call or application box like for example

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,670
you can exploit WebKit especially on the

72
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,870
froyo 2.2 2.2 for your thing so that is

73
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,890
like a WebKit engine bucks on the

74
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,320
browser so you can pretty much hack in a

75
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,540
break into the browser and try to secure

76
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,830
shell code that will install your

77
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,200
vacation and then also there are also

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,100
click application as well like your

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,180
people are talking about dreamed or

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,030
removal to back to to our unapproved if

81
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,950
i'm not mistaken and there is also

82
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,560
people try to abuse that by releasing a

83
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,840
fake application which is a malware by

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,600
itself to pretending to be a removal for

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
dream god and of course the latest one

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,890
is a spy i fix security tool oh well

87
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,660
don't worry about spare arts by example

88
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,130
are we going to do some analysis on that

89
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,070
later on infection method the third

90
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,170
alarm probably doing barrymore install

91
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,690
for example on if i can compromise the

92
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,239
gmail account and then that it's like a

93
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:12,860
web-based application installation which

94
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,230
is only required for jima credential you

95
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,399
can pretty much log in and do

96
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,980
installation on behalf of the compromise

97
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,019
a victim okay so you can do any more

98
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,860
info over the over the market so reverse

99
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,880
engineering android now are so before

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,160
subdivision tuning android malware the

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,960
thing that you need to understand then

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,780
the nature of five of the of the

103
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,200
application for example for the Android

104
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,180
application they normally go with the

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,120
APK which is pretty much a zip file so

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,560
you need to extract a dex fine side

107
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
there and then you can do reverse

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,510
engineering by you can do static or you

109
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,330
can do interactive debugging is possible

110
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,830
due to the fact that you can do some

111
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,430
installation on top of the APK file and

112
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,590
then the last one for example some

113
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,390
people probably just only want to share

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,060
the axe with you which is dogged x is

115
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
pretty much the fire inside the APK okay

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,030
so only reversing is possible a few

117
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,790
files or folder will be missing for

118
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,970
example resources as I and Android

119
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,060
manifest going to be missed and then

120
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,740
this is pretty much the building process

121
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,890
for building application for example the

122
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,480
first thing you that we you need to have

123
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,090
is a java application okay you need to

124
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,790
code in java and then of course you need

125
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,610
to do some compilation to get the to get

126
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,130
fast of java and the last thing you need

127
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,010
to do is doing some DXM to get the dalek

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,410
format okay then I've got the last thing

129
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,090
is you need to repackage into the

130
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,540
application or apt application normally

131
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,240
if you're running kind of SDK is

132
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,200
generated automatically for you so that

133
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,140
is on the building process when it comes

134
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,910
to reverse engineering you always lead

135
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,890
to good opposite way right so the first

136
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,570
thing that you need to know you need to

137
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,360
have now is the desktop so that next

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,090
normal look like this one so this is the

139
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,830
language of that jvm now vical you have

140
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,320
you know classes you have which were

141
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,200
meted and you have function here and so

142
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,750
on and so forth so this is on the Ducks

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,120
from by code and when you want to

144
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,310
convert it to this assembly you need to

145
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,060
use meta code isn't disassembling and a

146
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,610
couple of 24 doing disassembling you can

147
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,990
use bucks Molly to do

148
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,360
this is something you can also use and

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,360
the ex to do this assembling as well so

150
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,820
you're going to receive our classes

151
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,460
depend on tools that you use and/or

152
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,820
maybe you can receive a doll with

153
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,050
disassembling output which is look

154
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,260
pretty much like this before this is not

155
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,530
really readable so much but this is oh

156
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,450
well it's acceptable I think it's

157
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,540
readable and mr. acceptable you can

158
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,580
pretty much understand for example this

159
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,350
one this is a few for for the wearable

160
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,830
as I must receive for example okay and

161
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,300
normally when it comes to the next stage

162
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
you try to convert everything to the

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,470
origin code which is in reverse

164
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,610
engineering normally we call it

165
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,790
decompiling right so you need to have

166
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,610
the component which is going to turn

167
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,520
back into the Java or Java code which is

168
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,670
going to look like this okay so this is

169
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,130
pretty much the Java so that's pretty

170
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,380
much the reverse engineering process for

171
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,350
the for the Android okay couple of two

172
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,020
that you can use or disassembler like I

173
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,660
say you can use the but smelly you can

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,110
also use d DX and the X the X term that

175
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,420
is done we generate the first doll with

176
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,560
biker ok and then assemble huge do some

177
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,380
modification on the assembly code and

178
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,750
you want to reassemble back you can use

179
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,670
assembler like smiley to resemble back

180
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,670
and of course our box Mellie and smelly

181
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,290
is somehow the repackaged to the another

182
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,030
tool called apktool which is our

183
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,900
thinking of really mentioned previously

184
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,030
so this is a bunch of tool text editor

185
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,230
what do you want to do a reverse

186
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,730
engineering offer you need to text

187
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,470
editor to just reviewing all the spot

188
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,560
and not by its final thing but you can

189
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,230
have like a syntax highlighter feel free

190
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,840
to use a couple of wind can support the

191
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,070
highlighter and last tools is probably

192
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,409
the extra job or debts to get do some

193
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:44,240
decompiling for you like you gave you

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,060
the took the tool the dot that's class

195
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,940
and we converted our jar and you can

196
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,630
open with the JD

197
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,730
get to open the java java class to the

198
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,400
java code okay so let's couple of two

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,920
that you can use when you start

200
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,960
reversing during the Android application

201
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,030
you need to understand what is your your

202
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,130
your starting point where you want to

203
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,010
start for example when you reverse C++

204
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,410
for example you're always looking for in

205
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,300
mean for example you're looking for me

206
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,520
function right and this one you can

207
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,790
always refer within the

208
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,980
androidmanifest.xml because it's pretty

209
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,290
much define the behavior of the

210
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,560
application for what we have a sample so

211
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,780
we can take a look on this one later on

212
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,790
well it's pretty much a binary data

213
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,580
encoded is so you can use to like epic a

214
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,070
tool to decode it and inside the

215
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,070
applique androidmanifest.xml is also

216
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,230
however permission required like when

217
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,080
you install android application we tell

218
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,480
you this okay this application require

219
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,220
these permission and so on and so forth

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,040
okay and it's also gives you entry point

221
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,310
for example if this in 10 are what is

222
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,770
the service need to start if this in

223
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,140
turn this is for example you have a

224
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,560
state of Wi-Fi connected so that is

225
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,080
pretty much it in time so which in turn

226
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,740
with our services or which code that

227
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,480
need to respond to that are to that

228
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,610
state for example so it's normally

229
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,010
defined within this receiver in turn

230
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,950
action service and also activities okay

231
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,000
so take a look at this example this is

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,130
androidmanifest.xml take a look at this

233
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,280
one so it's pretty much for example

234
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,200
receiver for this one if the action of

235
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,650
your phone or your Android phone have

236
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,810
action of a some app that we see which

237
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,750
is when you receive an SMS so there is a

238
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,150
code that going to respond to it so in

239
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,880
this case is pretty much the class or

240
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,910
SMS receiver will be respond to it okay

241
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,370
so that is the way how you you know you

242
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,020
navigate your code analysis by by you

243
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,490
know by looking at android

244
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,490
if I thought I smell and of course one

245
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,520
of the important thinking about the

246
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,050
androidmanifest.xml is the user

247
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,149
permission for example is your

248
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,600
application is only for you know playing

249
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,959
game for example you have like a game

250
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,410
application well gamification probably

251
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,950
don't need to do to receive SMS to

252
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,040
receive SMS or sentence a mass right so

253
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,300
you know the probe is something was

254
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,010
wrong with the application that this is

255
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,250
all so you can stop looking at which

256
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,380
within the code going to look for this

257
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,149
kind of cone machine and there you can

258
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,550
stop your analysis on that particular

259
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:48,800
code okay all right and well reversing

260
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,180
here in pretty much is solving a puzzle

261
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,220
so when you're dealing with a huge code

262
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,770
base of Android application because you

263
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,080
notice you have a free application for

264
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,690
Android it's also a bundle together with

265
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,540
them sometime they also bonded together

266
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,950
with the you know kind of like add

267
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,300
application so you have like pop up for

268
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,370
app or something so sometime you also

269
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,440
had time to analyze on the air on the ad

270
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,630
application as well she's probably I

271
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,480
think it's not probably best thing to do

272
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,760
because that is probably not the first

273
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,010
place the bad guy going to modify the

274
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,810
code right so always try just doing some

275
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,270
studying mr. grad and looking for

276
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,690
suspicious string for example net and

277
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,290
crypto server SMS phone or whatever you

278
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,480
think you can think that you know it's

279
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,760
not supposed to something that

280
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,709
suspicious for you all right and of

281
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,720
course try to look for like a suspicious

282
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,110
API or for example looking for SMS api

283
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,690
like for SMS api-based like you know

284
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,399
standard calling function for it like

285
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,930
for example you want to call some as

286
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,240
receiver you need to start like a get pd

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,390
you and you can get before and you get a

288
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,190
get

289
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,839
gets numbers and so forth so that you

290
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,839
can construct properly the data of SMA

291
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,290
and of course about male API network API

292
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,480
so that's just probably your starting

293
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,540
point when you're analyzing Android

294
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,800
application and of course oh when you we

295
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,450
wish I knew a bike rode a new code you

296
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,040
need to understand the bike put out of

297
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,830
it right you reverse engineering Java

298
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,779
you have to understand java bytecode if

299
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:40,160
you reverse engineering you know Mac oh

300
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,620
you need to understand my quest well the

301
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,410
same goes on the Android are so enter a

302
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,510
pretty much rely on the elite by code so

303
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,580
you need to understand the nature of a

304
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,790
dalek biker video documentation of

305
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,930
course android get dr. no and this is

306
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,779
also good references all from gabble

307
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,980
gabble a code to cardiac sir so pretty

308
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,650
much the data here is based on his

309
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,830
reverse engineering under that occur

310
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,790
decks by code up code and this is also a

311
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,390
couple of a coupe and this is also a

312
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,430
good reference to understand that the

313
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,440
API call from the Android SDK and so

314
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,620
this is pretty much for the dalvik

315
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,170
bytecode for example you have class or

316
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,600
something and you have super it look

317
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,459
like similar to the Java like your

318
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,020
family this Java is pretty much looks

319
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,070
similar but the in term of function like

320
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,470
for example invoke something is half

321
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,910
many invoke for this one they have like

322
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,490
a five-pin book so you need understand

323
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,830
for like invoke invoke direct what is

324
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,839
mean by in book direct and invoke

325
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,680
interface how we reflect your result all

326
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,510
of it right so you need to understand

327
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,000
understand of this and for example that

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,190
s gay I screwed what it mean by that

329
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,080
like does it reach any rate is it

330
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,610
written a you know object that's it

331
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,250
written you know interference and so

332
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,580
forth so we need to understand pretty

333
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,620
much the language of the that way so for

334
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,030
example this is loop

335
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,210
this is move this is like if Al's like

336
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,060
go to something and this is GAD this is

337
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,970
I get this is until you get so that many

338
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,620
of it that we need to understand like

339
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,080
for example you create array or what

340
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,440
kind of written out of it and this is

341
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,200
like if something like if not equal if

342
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,610
greater than something and if liquid and

343
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,290
something so there are a lot of thing

344
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,880
that we need to understand on this right

345
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,330
um so that's pretty much a stopping

346
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,850
point when we try to do reverse

347
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,350
engineering so this is pretty much case

348
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,870
study that we run in our lap so the

349
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,800
first thing is well many of you know a

350
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,130
family in android malware so the first

351
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,220
one is January SMS stealer this one is

352
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,470
sample that we have here is pretty much

353
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,300
interesting why this is very interesting

354
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,640
if you take a look at this then you

355
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,160
follow any android android application

356
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,810
tutorial they're going to start with

357
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,600
this like android application one like

358
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,640
example one of something so the guy

359
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,800
follow exactly the same concept but

360
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,230
instead of doing something cool it doing

361
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,570
something off like a stealing SMS so

362
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,120
this sort of like for example i

363
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,710
mentioned you can start looking for

364
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,900
suspicious name so this one like you

365
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,120
grab something and you look for SMS many

366
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,310
of you so you know this could have

367
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:45,060
something to do with SMS right and so on

368
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,620
this sample the good thing about this

369
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,170
sample i received the sample without APK

370
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,460
so i have no androidmanifest.xml any so

371
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,930
i need to stop thinking what it'll

372
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,870
probably the most common sense when

373
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,720
people are you know raikou and what is

374
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,090
the the first function that's going to

375
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,800
be easy cute right because you have

376
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,390
android manifest you can look at the

377
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,310
android manifest and find your entry

378
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,770
point but if you don't have you need to

379
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,780
start looking at the code and normally

380
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,660
for further for the android application

381
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,560
if you have in it on create or on in it

382
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,599
on seen it that is probably the best

383
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,500
place for you to to a starting point so

384
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,720
you need to inspect all the code so in

385
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,169
this case well the application is about

386
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,289
doing SMS but is half a fine am coll

387
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:36,090
movie player is a big branding as a

388
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,259
movie player but he's also do well we're

389
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,029
not doing anything is about movie at all

390
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:45,239
just still your SMS okay so inside this

391
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,220
code that is a function like if you take

392
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,220
a look before this function movie player

393
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,999
have something that have api call to the

394
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:57,929
SMS manager so so it's pretty much a

395
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,350
good place for us to stop right and if

396
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,299
you take a look at this for example you

397
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,559
need in it so this is the place that we

398
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,710
can in it on to it so this is probably

399
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,659
the good candidate for you to start your

400
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,960
analysis right and this is also a very

401
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,419
easy example because it only have like a

402
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,609
35 so it's much easier for you to do

403
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:23,159
analysis and then if you using this kind

404
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,269
of approach for to analyze one of the

405
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,909
cool android malware is called answer

406
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,369
but i wish good luck for that because a

407
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:37,129
huge fight roughly have about like 50

408
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,899
classes which is quite enough numbers of

409
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:43,889
glasses and then if we inspect on create

410
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,529
take a look at this example so you stop

411
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:50,159
something like you know concreate and

412
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:53,340
doing some tax view and this is when you

413
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,859
click on this application you click at

414
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,690
that the application are we going to

415
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,389
give you some tax view like thanks for

416
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,480
clicking me but in this in this sample a

417
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,999
gift this is not really garbage its kind

418
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:09,710
of unicode in a Russian language so this

419
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,480
is a record says something please wait

420
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,639
we doing something all right and the

421
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:17,669
next like is you know try to call get

422
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:21,049
default which is calling from the this

423
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,840
SDK for the SMS manager right to get the

424
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,299
force which must get like I mentioned

425
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,929
you need to have like a proper API

426
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,210
calling method to get the to get the SMS

427
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,100
so the first thing you need to do is try

428
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,659
to get the part of the SMS manager and

429
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,029
later on so this is get before this is

430
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:43,380
something and so

431
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,310
and the next so this is the way you

432
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,820
preview start to you know crafting your

433
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
input when you for example the next call

434
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,460
is probably sent SMS to something right

435
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,490
so for example you want to steal

436
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,050
somebody and then you want to send this

437
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,390
out to two different numbers for example

438
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,640
so you need to properly crop like if I

439
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,830
want you to assign back to this number

440
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,130
so you need to crop your your your data

441
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,740
for example this is the number that you

442
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,260
in you need to sign at the same so this

443
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,170
is the result of gap before so this is

444
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,050
your SMS it is the text and this is the

445
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,460
numbers for example and I am the next

446
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,460
thing is called a function called send

447
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,380
texts okay so if we sent by providing

448
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,870
this is this is the parameter that you

449
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,310
need to send like a from visual 2v5 this

450
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,620
is the parameter for the function same

451
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,590
text message so how you get a parameter

452
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,370
is by crafting this like a V 0 v1 v2 v3

453
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,990
and v4 and refi right and then you send

454
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,300
SMS and it's not only one it's the multi

455
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,800
pattern of it and oh sorry this is worse

456
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,550
than SMS still up is it basically SMS

457
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,920
code fraud so when you send a like

458
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,080
premium numbers and you got credit out

459
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,360
of it right so this is pretty much how

460
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,000
how the guy get money out of by sending

461
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,850
SMS using a phone numbers and it's only

462
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,870
sent five why if you send non-stop we

463
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,940
probably dumb right i mean people going

464
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,980
to be running out of credit right but if

465
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,140
you sound like five who care you lost

466
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,180
about like five bucks more people

467
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,920
probably not matthison right and it's

468
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,550
also have mechanism like the last one it

469
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,850
color function was mean to study decide

470
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,580
to modify some data to be like a neck

471
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,520
when you run if the worst is sad for one

472
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,150
then please do not send this another SMS

473
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,380
there's only part time and that

474
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,650
sit okay so they so this pretty macho

475
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:08,890
for these SMS data right was so then is

476
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,110
just finished so we just closed the just

477
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,850
a minute application and then well one

478
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,310
of the huge malware under that the

479
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,870
creature wave of Android is a dream

480
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,910
droid the good thing about this android

481
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,730
android Adam droid malware is it come it

482
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,450
bonded together with the J Brock

483
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,310
jailbreaking to so you install this

484
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,800
malware well your phone will be

485
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,070
jailbreaking by this guy so so it's

486
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,520
tyrell it's very famous in this one it's

487
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,980
a modular friendly is impacting

488
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,290
legitimate software we have roughly

489
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,830
about 53 software infected by this

490
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,160
variant and the good thing about this is

491
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,810
also hosted at the market for a

492
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,770
marketplace so you probably google like

493
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,170
you try to search for something like

494
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,180
playing game one of the thing that we

495
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,400
analyze is a monkey jump application so

496
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,290
you is it for monkey jump which is a

497
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,400
game you probably you know have extra

498
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,890
features of the monkey jump which is

499
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,160
dream doric malware so it's a bundle

500
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,260
together with a to exploit which is

501
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,940
exclude a CBE 2009 1185 and the last the

502
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,550
latest one was a witch against the cage

503
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,220
and this is also good on this one

504
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,830
because this is the second publicly

505
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,750
known malware that have the vault

506
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,450
ability when I say BOTS you mean like it

507
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,850
can send you something and then your

508
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,980
phone will be respond to the for them to

509
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,430
them our well take a look at the last

510
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,850
live circle R is also based on intent

511
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,590
based on launch so it's just a fake

512
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,290
application no it's infected application

513
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,420
you need to run the application so every

514
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,700
trigger a couple of entry point for the

515
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,700
further and further for the dream droid

516
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,820
code so it started by looking some

517
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,700
profile it is there

518
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,280
going to stop and it's also check it

519
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,740
that is any application called download

520
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,900
manager it's installed if it's already

521
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,190
installed in stock so for analysis /

522
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,380
perspective you know why I application

523
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,100
check for something on this maybe you're

524
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,380
trying to prevent him from to do it you

525
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,660
know double installation or maybe it's

526
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,220
one you know some detection against this

527
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,890
application right so but it's also good

528
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,230
to analyze on this one because the neck

529
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,010
logic here if it's not installed then

530
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:48,390
you remove a file called SQL DB to

531
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,880
something else called Dow providing

532
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,910
energy door APK so when you sit when you

533
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,880
when you unzip the APK file APK as you

534
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,040
know is it just a zip file right so when

535
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,350
you unzip the file you probably not this

536
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,780
SQL DB so SQL DB is pretty much the

537
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,890
default implementation for this is

538
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,740
probably to to store data right but this

539
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,630
guy using in different way so this is

540
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,790
basically well it's a different name

541
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,640
which is this is basically a a PK

542
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,090
another Android application okay so you

543
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,410
just copy to a download provider manager

544
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,100
APK so this is the code its need to

545
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,430
start from launch and this is the physis

546
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,040
do something else okay and it's also

547
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,980
throughout if noises try to do destroy

548
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
destroy so this right is basically

549
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,110
trying to root your box okay and the

550
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,070
last is is going to copy itself to their

551
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,940
to copy the sqlite DB to the download

552
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,020
provided or APK okay so this is not the

553
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,050
first payload okay the first step that

554
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,690
we bundled with the infected application

555
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,900
it's also reaching the phone white want

556
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,000
to root your phone does not try to help

557
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,790
you to jailbreak your phone is basically

558
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,400
try to get root out of it so the main

559
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,070
reason that you get root fear is to

560
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,400
achieve this copy file so if you manage

561
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,520
to copy the

562
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,180
your application to this flush system

563
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,710
when you view any store application

564
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,110
you're not going to find it because it

565
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,270
have a real privilege and then it can be

566
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,060
run stiffly okay so that is the goal of

567
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,070
reaching the phone okay and this is the

568
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,080
the exploit the first one is you deaf

569
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,030
and then is the second one try to use

570
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:50,080
adb route so this is the code this one

571
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,870
going to run you de so go go for root

572
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,870
and this also go for you as well okay so

573
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,030
this is how they call the function to

574
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,290
root your box right so this is you da so

575
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,450
this is your desk is also been bundle as

576
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,730
a APK so if you took a look at the

577
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,370
sample here so it gives you sound like

578
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,300
prepare raw file and install to change

579
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,850
Wi-Fi state to change the something to

580
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,020
trigger bucks and then you can stop do

581
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,590
some you know exploit on the box okay

582
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,650
today's a condition need to be me buy

583
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,140
you that route okay for example try to

584
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,470
change the conflict Wi-Fi Wi-Fi state

585
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:37,450
okay and then this one is I things on

586
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,760
the second exploit so this is also

587
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,590
prepare oh and then run exploits for all

588
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,590
it's also have calling function are

589
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,500
coming home so like I see I have a broad

590
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,240
capability like when you install your

591
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,090
machine we contact you it will contact

592
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,100
his home right to update whatever you

593
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,770
want in this case are still bunch of

594
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,930
information this is kind of very crazy

595
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,060
it's still pretty much everything your

596
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,870
email not your email your email numbers

597
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,170
your phone numbers as any SMS your SDK

598
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,260
version and any application install are

599
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,800
there anything this guy still and and

600
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,670
the sources try to increase wasn't a

601
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,970
scriptwriter of whiskey the URL is not

602
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:29,170
adhere this function and this function

603
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,040
and you call our post URL so when you

604
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,090
push you at all you

605
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,760
to pass function right the parameter so

606
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,419
probably the link of the of the URL

607
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,700
right but she not you don't see it

608
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,190
because that is the way it called like

609
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,000
try to get object or of the setting that

610
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,700
this function so you need to analyze the

611
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,110
same are on this far so this is pretty

612
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,779
much the fire setting something right so

613
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,990
this is the way is that the fungal the

614
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,640
farm so this is the function that sad

615
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,210
the URL okay it implements some doing

616
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,640
something a creep here and if you son

617
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,159
run and this is the the data that we

618
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,320
want to analyze right so this is the

619
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,529
crib function so if you analyze function

620
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,750
of the crib you took looky here this

621
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,059
also tried to get key really out of our

622
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,470
of data from this data of a DB loop came

623
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,010
key value and also try to get by and

624
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,279
doing some zone so it's pretty much more

625
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:39,250
lashes doing some tour of zhou for each

626
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,000
key try to do like a data though with

627
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,909
the keys right and this is if you do

628
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,640
though a operation you find you will

629
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,159
find this URL okay while still

630
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,730
information this is thing that is still

631
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,700
get email get emma skye and social than

632
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,350
anything i just keep couple of thing

633
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,070
here like a client in for partners

634
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,909
product ID time anything right on so

635
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,740
this is on the second pillow the first

636
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,399
one is are attached with the impact

637
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,980
application so that it can draw their

638
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,320
download provided manager okay the

639
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,130
download provide manager try to install

640
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,460
within the sliced system apt which is

641
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,850
can be running stuff and what it does

642
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,100
what you need to do reverse engineering

643
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,470
on the android under on this download

644
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,390
apk it's also start from

645
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,809
androidmanifest.xml to and based on my

646
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:44,080
analysis is pretty much have have a lot

647
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,809
of

648
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,809
you know communication with the census

649
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:52,850
server more or less a above features on

650
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,279
this dream droid is a half in fifth it's

651
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,759
all have to pay load to stage fellow the

652
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,220
first fellow is to root the device the

653
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,870
second tell you it is to the recent

654
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,029
instruction from the same scene so Zeus

655
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,129
and one of you heard about zus malware

656
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:13,600
before I things use is kind of very

657
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,629
family's financial malware so it's also

658
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:21,940
some are impacting their Android as well

659
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,529
so part of bigger financial mail a

660
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:27,590
package is from the use what this pack

661
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,539
is focus on one or more on many

662
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,789
individual men in the mobile which is we

663
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,860
call it zip mall which is the Z's in the

664
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,999
middle of this in the mobile which is

665
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,460
used to run on symbian before are also

666
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,309
run on win mobile and also now run on

667
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:46,669
the Android the way infraction is by

668
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,279
patting wire at a fit application okay

669
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,740
we just have from some relationship with

670
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,320
a previously installed the use of

671
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,919
malware so the way the way we spot is

672
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,210
the relation between the deuce binary

673
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,779
and the use on Android due to the fact

674
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,379
that both applicat both the use binary

675
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,570
and use on Android is connecting to the

676
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:17,029
same server so if you install this

677
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:21,259
application or you you have a PK normal

678
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:22,970
you can install right to do some dynamic

679
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,450
Nazis so if you install application it

680
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,389
gives you this icon and your family with

681
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:32,779
the trust you you probably a word trust

682
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:35,990
here is doing a lot of wishes to fight

683
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,860
with us so kind of engineering for

684
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,179
me which is a sintering always work so

685
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:45,740
so this is a social engineering like

686
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,179
when you click on the application

687
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,340
because you probably want to click that

688
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,899
because based on your observations here

689
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:56,779
this is like trustee report right which

690
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:58,210
is neat to this sound

691
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,650
validation so you past couple of

692
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,000
validation here and all of your SMS will

693
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,490
be still buy this car so we take a look

694
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,630
again at the Android manifest it says

695
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,810
here whenever SMS received you going to

696
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,450
activate SMS receiver does you take a

697
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,190
look at some has receiver function here

698
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,580
so this is the SMS receiver function

699
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,280
it's like a crate from pd you get

700
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,000
original of original originating address

701
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,780
get message body and the next is send

702
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:39,470
data to the server so this droid pretty

703
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,500
much the component is smelly justice to

704
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,370
any SMS application as a data it's very

705
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,500
primitive compared to his cousin from

706
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,450
blackberry or symbian the bad thing

707
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,790
about this is just to everything SMS

708
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,550
received which is kind of for me it's

709
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:04,160
kind of dumb can I say that because you

710
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,920
know running on phone and then you have

711
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,540
constantly connection to the remote

712
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,199
server then you can somehow create some

713
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,090
sort of red flag like why you need to

714
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,270
have instant connection alright so I

715
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,850
think maybe they just only need to steal

716
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,649
SMS bomb mobile banking related only so

717
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,659
and then it's sent SMS to this server

718
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,210
and then by using some minute URL and

719
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,960
push there are two this particular URL

720
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,090
this god why this guy do then use a

721
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,980
method on like standing ovation mast

722
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,600
it's going to be crazy because

723
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,060
everything else em as we see it is also

724
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,760
another SMS going out right so it's not

725
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,590
very practical but it is sending to this

726
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,168
I think it is really thinking probably

727
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:54,469
good idea and then another good thing

728
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,500
about android now is a new addition to

729
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,770
family this is spy I people done dealing

730
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,590
with is use and do you sell the coat too

731
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,170
despite I kind of thing so the guy from

732
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,210
spy okay let go to the mobile because

733
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,270
everybody is talking about mobile by now

734
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,750
so is Zeus we call this dismal but do

735
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,280
you guys predict on spy I speak speak

736
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,080
more rights but I in the middle in the

737
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,340
moma so this is inspire so pretty much a

738
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,630
part of bigger punish your mouth a

739
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,080
package again but this one is inspire

740
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,910
this focus like I shake this pretty much

741
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,160
similar this is interesting because in

742
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,220
fact in by effective which is caused by

743
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,100
infected application infected by spy I

744
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,160
desktop as we know inspire our boundary

745
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,780
normally infecting on windows so and we

746
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,080
know on the spine I you have loved web

747
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,360
in Jack right but i have like vho

748
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,700
browser helper object so when you try to

749
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,150
go to like for example bang whatever so

750
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,940
if that you are a part of the web inject

751
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,170
can over data so it will pop up a new

752
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,920
JavaScript or whatever you know pop up

753
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,800
or can I say pop up or uninterested pop

754
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,160
up to do something in this case is also

755
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,010
interesting or this specifically while I

756
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,130
see in Spanish sure thing anybody

757
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,760
anybody read Spanish I don't I just got

758
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,890
this information why are the end of yr

759
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,430
spy I civility spare I so when you

760
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,440
reverse power you can get a conflict up

761
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,540
in right inside it inside the conflict

762
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,400
up being there is a lot plugin for that

763
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,370
weapon jacket EST so if you have web

764
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,170
injured arch st and you're looking some

765
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,360
of data it may have the data so in this

766
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,880

Andrew application that you're really

785
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,330
going to bar and replicate android phone

786
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,610
you just install these random

787
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,130
application probably not right but uh

788
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:00,000
well not all people are smart somehow so

789
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,890
that is a cage people download this and

790
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,110
you scroll into their machine not a

791
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,580
machine install into your phone so so

792
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,380
the guard in fact if it is used oh so

793
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,860
this is the part this is within the

794
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,410
browser our credit on this one is from

795
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,710
trust you it has the spanish translation

796
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,250
on this one you mentioned some like this

797
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,500
is new features and blah blah blah now

798
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,020
you can pass the automation

799
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,990
authorization you know is the phone and

800
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,720
the bank security system so now all the

801
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,260
mobile banking need to go to their

802
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,870
through this application now so being a

803
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,550
humble with just install plication and

804
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,950
then what it does net is stuck to the

805
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,620
bunch of thing like the application that

806
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,350
pretending to be from the bank is neat

807
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,800
to have internet social media is sin SMS

808
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,230
and most of the good thing about this is

809
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,680
try to read your phone state and process

810
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,030
outgoing call I mean that problem

811
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,100
generous from the bank try to do this

812
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,470
kind of thing right and similar to the

813
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,690
counter to the previous sample you take

814
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,690
a look here is any SMS received or any

815
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,050
new ongoing call please enable this

816
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,750
function oh no please activate the

817
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,130
function this is the receiver of the

818
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,250
function right so you reverse this so it

819
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,660
take a look at this function as a man

820
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,330
receive so it try to this is yosef this

821
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:46,480
kind of you know when trying to get some

822
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,780
data out of this setting that I chanel

823
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,270
so instead of doing a middle like post

824
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,250
you allow something this guy try to do

825
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,530
something else try to read reading the

826
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,960
setting the SML so they're probably

827
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,520
monitor is something inside the setting

828
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,830
that SML right so we take a look at

829
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,530
stepping darkest ml so you can find out

830
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,460
a lot of one's domain names here so you

831
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,820
have like whatever global bond slice ms

832
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,930
gate dot PHP if you try a tracking spell

833
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,590
Ozu's get the PHP is probably you know

834
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,340
the instant indication that you are

835
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,800
dealing with that the use or spare so

836
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,780
this within the setting the HTML easter

837
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:34,750
is the is the calling home for this spy

838
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:40,930
I application and based on function

839
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:46,270
based on numbers from this code it we do

840
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,760
their perform action because you have

841
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,040
the two ways of sending bacteria from

842
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
the stolen information to the tackle our

843
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,130
implement by using sending SMS and also

844
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,850
by using a URL based on this location

845
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,500
okay and so that's pretty much the

846
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,840
sample it's a relatively straightforward

847
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,640
that is no magic when you reverse

848
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
engineering Android application also

849
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,290
challenge when I say no been magic but

850
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,580
that this is also a challenge when it

851
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,250
comes to reverse-engineer Android while

852
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,290
android now is probably still premature

853
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,800
I would say no I once the Android is not

854
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,450
matching Android is probably well

855
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,850
established but Android malware is

856
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,310
probably not there yet for example doing

857
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,890
some weird you know who came in stuff

858
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,650
like that we don't see any well based on

859
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,150
my limited knowledge of publicly

860
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,160
available method I don't see anything

861
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,880
like that yeah okay so maybe some in

862
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,650
future you can probably expect something

863
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,570
like half like a rootkit capability on

864
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,540
the android android platform so a couple

865
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,100
of our normal rivers engineering

866
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,380
challenge our clip of education when you

867
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,820
reverse engineering when you start

868
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,550
reversing and android as you stop

869
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,320
without dealing with a normal like

870
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,440
program is by default we bitten on but

871
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,270
if you get used with that there is

872
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,100
nothing much on the office kitchen under

873
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,930
pro golf association encryption or

874
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,720
mackin ass is harder eventually we will

875
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,670
broken especially based on current

876
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,370
sample because you you include your keys

877
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,640
and your data we did a sample so sooner

878
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,410
or later people will discover that right

879
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,650
so this is not really good and

880
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,330
customizing a finial ponies very happily

881
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,120
metate kind of resources so you need to

882
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,460
be optimized while it good for devices

883
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,650
but it's going to be painful for reverse

884
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,650
engineering and of course kappa watch

885
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,130
gallon like auntie auntie analysis are

886
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,540
pretty much people like you know the

887
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,920
common practice probably drop

888
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,240
application into like you know a vm for

889
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,790
example we can do a lot of anti emulator

890
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,520
like if i can finger print email for

891
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,160
example email for like your android sdk

892
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,430
is always written 000 so if i have email

893
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,530
000 i'm not going to do anything right

894
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,960
the typical you know the EMA we're kind

895
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,770
of NT announce it I can also do like

896
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,900
phone numbers and of course within your

897
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,760
humility you don't have phone numbers so

898
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,500
I can you know fingerprint on that as

899
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,200
well while kind of similar to vm

900
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,230
detection right anti anti emulator so

901
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,910
how to solve this problem try to pack

902
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,040
simulator after all military's open

903
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,630
source you can patch whatever you want

904
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,570
and if you also can run via kamu instead

905
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,010
of running a military you can run over

906
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,290
cable we can do a lot of patching on

907
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:39,100
that and of course our decompiling

908
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,470
problem for reverse engineer is you can

909
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:43,540
have like translation from Dax to Java

910
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,610
that probably ocean well of course it

911
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,410
depending if you kind of like hate Joe

912
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,820
are you probably not happy with that as

913
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,490
well right so converting native dialect

914
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,890
read our decks to jay is a good example

915
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,880
to cook logic confusing and incomplete

916
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,589
code be compiling this is the two

917
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:02,559
a common problem I'm normally face when

918
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,009
i start rivers on android malware so for

919
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,589
example take a look at this case example

920
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:11,229
while you have cash to and then it goes

921
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:15,069
somewhere do something is continued so

922
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,440
it for me my question your opinion i

923
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,109
think this is much easier for me to

924
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:22,569
understand it do some switch for you

925
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:26,880
like a tax which 320 this is default and

926
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,890
switch to do something compared to this

927
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,519
switch right of course it's depending on

928
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,229
where you come in from you like java you

929
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:37,599
probably enjoy javed and then I hate

930
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,390
then I hate tell us or so it's depend

931
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,690
right and the decompiling error you

932
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,119
thinking that ok cool we can decompiling

933
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,460
everything to Java but good luck when

934
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,469
you dealing with some optimizing code in

935
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:52,900
is normally brick so you end up like oh

936
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,489
 I have to go and learn them all

937
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:56,979
this deal with my code again so you have

938
00:44:56,979 --> 00:45:02,229
to learn all this we do LDC invoke

939
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:03,880
special or wherever you have to go back

940
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,499
to square one again and learn all the

941
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:07,569
dalvik bytecode right so that's part of

942
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:09,759
capital problem and this is not related

943
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,589
to reverse engineering but it is also

944
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:13,809
common sent by can how do you spot the

945
00:45:13,809 --> 00:45:16,779
malicious application out of thousand of

946
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:18,880
application within the market market

947
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,460
market store how you spot this is

948
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,950
analogous right of course is easy to

949
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,450
blame google but i don't think that is

950
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,160
this a solution right because that is

951
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,680
still party or you know and android

952
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,279
market as well right so how you trace

953
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,559
that and the first thing that needs to

954
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,479
be interesting is doing some remote

955
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:39,759
install why america and also like a

956
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:42,369
remote remove remote and install by

957
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,660
google are these people can abuse then

958
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,130
that probably scary someone can like

959
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,680
Ezekiel something and it will wipe out

960
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,900
application within your phone right so

961
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,239
this is also part of issue of other than

962
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:58,299
the talent and conclusion all of this i

963
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,729
think android malware is just a topic

964
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:02,349
more complex android malware are

965
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,859
expected to that will be ready and then

966
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:08,140
more export on an android platform i

967
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,089
expected now people are attacking more

968
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:11,950
on the qualification like a browser

969
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:14,530
and stuff like that but I believe in

970
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,750
future people start to break to party

971
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,240
application and more powerful hardware i

972
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,430
think we change the landscape for know

973
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,650
like people doing doors over your tablet

974
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,079
or whatever so it's depending under how

975
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,780
the tablet move i think right and it's

976
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,000
possible to reverse engineering android

977
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,190
malware and their understanding your

978
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,450
Valek is so much and for reversing your

979
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,579
impurity my solving a puzzle right get

980
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,400
peace of pazzo and one by one there

981
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,960
nothing you can solve the release in

982
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,310
january while reversing repackage

983
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,470
application is not fun meaning there is

984
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,359
someone we pack a show your app and

985
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:55,240
start to put any malice applique any

986
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,920
code inside there it's not going to be

987
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,010
fun so because if you code base so if

988
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,400
you have something like lifting to to

989
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,839
check the different that would be

990
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:07,060
awesome but the problem is how you know

991
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,700
which one is the original this is

992
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,070
because it's hosted in market store you

993
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,619
think that this original will probably

994
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,290
not be assumption right a couple of

995
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,490
