1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,020
thank you very much it is a pleasure to

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,890
be back at hack in the box and the real

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,539
pleasure is coming and engaging with

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,160
people in dialogue and getting a sense

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,020
that the way we are all calibrating

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,869
what's happening out there in cyberspace

7
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:31,840
and in here in our words and the way we

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,730
construct reality really is being

9
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,010
perceived by a lot of us pretty much the

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,079
same way I've been doing this for a long

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,430
time this being hanging out and avoiding

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,879
work and I'm trying to pay attention to

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,530
what's going on and it seems as if

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,420
things really are moving in lockstep

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,089
pretty much the way a lot of us in the

16
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,030
80s and 90s saw they would move because

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,399
the technologies that we develop shape

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,100
every aspect of our lives and transform

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,289
every aspect of our lives up to and

20
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,440
including human identity so when I start

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,140
writing about hacker generations it was

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,760
interesting to notice one and then a

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,800
second and the third and really buy now

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,930
for generations in the 20 years I've

25
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,240
been doing this each one of which is

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,630
socialized by the technology so

27
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,600
unconsciously and that they come to

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,360
believe in themselves in relationship to

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,340
the technology without seeing the

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,680
technology in other words we believe

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,780
some things so deeply we don't even know

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,480
we believe them they become these sub

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,490
structure or the context of our lives

34
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,820
and when we look at the context of our

35
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,440
lives and turn it into what I call

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,500
cognitive artifacts when we turn context

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,780
into content then we're capable of

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,820
manipulating and using it and on the

39
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,560
question of identity which I've already

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,380
mentioned which is so central to what's

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,440
happening to us to know how someone

42
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,930
perceives themselves gives you a leg up

43
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,240
and it's really one of the cornerstones

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,970
of hacking including social engineering

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,360
because if someone doesn't know how they

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,810
are and you do then you can use how they

47
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,440
are to advantage the importance of this

48
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,959
in doing counterintelligence

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,400
counterintelligence for the hacking

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,030
culture means trying to understand and

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,300
anticipate what kind of world

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,300
it is we live in the depth of the

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,090
technologies of intrusion and

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,680
surveillance that have become endemic

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,290
and ubiquitous and which it looks as if

56
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,400
they will never go away we still base

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,790
our hopes sometimes on the way it was it

58
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,390
takes a while for our hearts to catch up

59
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,070
with our heads and our insights and

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,170
realize that things aren't going to

61
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,390
necessarily get better I had dinner and

62
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,710
amsterdam in May with an old friend who

63
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,960
does work with governments of many

64
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,390
countries to help develop the protocols

65
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,520
and policies aligned with their

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,200
technologies of surveillance and

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,690
intrusion those countries include

68
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,860
country places like Libya a prior Libya

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,730
Libya as it was so there was an amoral

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,830
approach to how you did it and what she

71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,350
said is they tell us what it is they're

72
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,990
going to do that is what they want to do

73
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,460
but what they want to do is what they're

74
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,560
going to do and then we have to write

75
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,380
the policies and protocols that enable

76
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,180
them legally to do what it is they're

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,850
going to do at any rate and there was

78
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,650
just a little part of my naive and

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,810
youthful heart that's still sprang to

80
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,270
life like a little green shoot shoot in

81
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,970
the snow and I said do you think we will

82
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,340
ever get back anything like what we used

83
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,590
to think of as freedom from surveillance

84
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,010
and observation and she said because it

85
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,400
is her work and she is steeped in it

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,390
unselfconsciously and without effort Oh

87
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,500
Richard of course not of course not so

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,780
you can see this is alarming or not

89
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
depending on how you like to construct

90
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,520
reality but what I hope we can do is see

91
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,980
that it is so it is reality and it's

92
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,470
philip k dick said reality is that which

93
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,340
when we stop believing in it refuses to

94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,149
go away so let's deal realistically with

95
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,940
what kind of world we are in and what we

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,640
can do about it in order to see if there

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,360
is any defensive measure which what I

98
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,270
will call a hacking collective's that is

99
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,700
groups of people and underscore groups

100
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,760
because you cannot do it alone unless

101
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,920
you're the hero

102
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,320
heroine of a novel like stieg larsson's

103
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,810
novel that's the only place you get to

104
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,120
be alone and take on the world and win

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,450
out here in the world the world wins and

106
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,790
unless we do some things together we're

107
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,130
not going to accomplish what we want and

108
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,610
on the other hand the task of doing

109
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,490
things together that is building trusted

110
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,250
communities in which we can count on the

111
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,410
people with whom were communicating to

112
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,380
be who they say they are and to know the

113
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,390
players even though often if we have a

114
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,760
program at all it's out of date or it's

115
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,650
tattered or something has happened to

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,420
the uniform of the players were watching

117
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,430
even while we watch and suddenly we

118
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,570
realize we've been looking not at

119
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,730
reality but at augmented reality and

120
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,830
they're not wearing the jersey of vista

121
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,720
that team but the jersey of another team

122
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,230
altogether I learned that long ago when

123
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,960
I first showed up at DEFCON naive and

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,110
interested I spoke this August for the

125
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,420
16th year at Def Con the first year

126
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,950
there were 300 and this year I think

127
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,440
there were they said 12,000 I didn't

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,650
count them all but the interesting

129
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,660
revelation of that first one was that

130
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,670
you couldn't tell people by their

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,010
uniforms there were people with great

132
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,290
spikes of blue hair and that usually

133
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,060
meant they were working undercover and

134
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,550
there were people in suits and that

135
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,110
usually meant they were hackers also

136
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,980
working undercover and you just didn't

137
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,770
know who was who I don't want this to

138
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,650
sound like a paranoid rant I have

139
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,630
occasionally been accused of being a

140
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,000
conspiracy theorist but that's just one

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,060
of the ways that people ridicule other

142
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,580
people a friend of mine who does

143
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,210
deception and lectures on it very

144
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,770
articulately says the three legs of the

145
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,580
stool of deception our illusion

146
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,120
misdirection and ridicule illusion

147
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,560
making something look like it's real

148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,990
which isn't there at all misdirection

149
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,880
when something is happening right in

150
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,550
front of your face simply distracting

151
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,160
you with distraction from distraction so

152
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,440
that you look away or look somewhere

153
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,150
else and when it's sitting

154
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,500
in the middle of the living room like an

155
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,780
elephant and you can't ignore it then

156
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,240
you so ridicule people who claim that

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,300
it's there that they stopped believing

158
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,610
in it themselves they have been

159
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,260
socialized to and have learned to

160
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,080
walking all around it and even though

161
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,580
everyone's walking around the elephant

162
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,410
and shaping their lives you're on the

163
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,110
elephant people about the narrative

164
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,630
would suggest that there is no elephant

165
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,020
at all a good example of how that comes

166
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,270
to play is one of my hobbies has been

167
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,980
investigating you off elegy for a long

168
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,020
time and I'm not going to go into any of

169
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,550
the details of that I'll just say that

170
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,710
nick pope who i know and who used to

171
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,680
head the mo d the UFO desk at the mo d

172
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,530
the Ministry of Defence in Britain and

173
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,660
managed responses to incidents for a

174
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,780
number of years finally said the obvious

175
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,480
but it's different when someone says the

176
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,600
obvious out loud he said in regard to a

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,820
couple of rather critical incidents in

178
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,160
which the radar proof and the eyewitness

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,980
proof and so on our core up were

180
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,210
congruent what they said instead was all

181
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,710
it's another person who saw a little

182
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,330
green men or something like that it was

183
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,690
just a report from a UFO buff when you

184
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,820
use language like that he said the

185
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,370
intention and we were directed to do it

186
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,950
was too so undermine the credibility of

187
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,740
the person making the report that no one

188
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,350
else would ever make a report and no one

189
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,240
would believe reports like that when you

190
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,550
have a man who did the work tell you

191
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,560
that the ridicule was a part of his

192
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,680
operational his modus operandi I'm

193
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,020
saying is you don't have to believe

194
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,420
everything you just have to know that

195
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,500
this is a standard operating procedure

196
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,570
so we're talking about the world as it

197
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,309
is and we're not talking about

198
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,650
conspiracies we're talking about the

199
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,659
growth of a national security state i'm

200
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,370
going to use america as my point of

201
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,980
reference I'm a guest in your country I

202
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,190
know nothing of Malaysia I have no idea

203
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,830
of any of the insights that I'm going to

204
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,810
share with you have anything to do with

205
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,300
life in Malaysia i believe it is

206
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
probably a different culture than

207
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,560
America and I would never want to

208
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,820
fen or say anything inappropriate having

209
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,700
made that disclaimer if you see any

210
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,920
relationship between what I am saying

211
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,620
and your own culture society or country

212
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,390
then by all means draw whatever

213
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,180
inference you can from that but from my

214
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,640
point of view that will be serendipitous

215
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,900
and accidental okay am i off the hook I

216
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,730
mean it wasn't that long ago that I was

217
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,140
invited to speak at a conference in

218
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,640
China and because when I say in the

219
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,380
United States is sometimes controversial

220
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,870
Early's contrarian but can be subversive

221
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,450
in a different country I said all I

222
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,520
watching you is a guarantee that I will

223
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,100
come in safely and leave safely and they

224
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,500
said thank you very much we would love

225
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,330
to have you speak perhaps another year

226
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,839
and that was that okay so how is it

227
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,730
we're talking about establishing some

228
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,770
benchmarks for how it is in cyberspace

229
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,690
Dave I tell runs the list lot of you

230
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,450
might note daily dave is a pretty smart

231
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,720
cookie he was referring to Mudge's talk

232
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,180
at black hat not long ago Mudge you may

233
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,930
remember our Peters echo is now

234
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,160
administering some of the black budget

235
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,260
programs for DARPA in information

236
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,800
security and doing a hell of a job and

237
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,630
he used to be known as much when he was

238
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,210
a hacker instead of a professional

239
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,880
person working on behalf of the

240
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,550
government and what he said is that

241
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,730
hackers are finding ways to manipulate

242
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,589
the emergent behaviors of their host

243
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,770
systems that is their guiding entire

244
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,280
economies into investing in technologies

245
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,790
that do not work and in this case he's

246
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,820
referring to anti virus signature

247
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,810
systems now you know that they don't

248
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,080
work as stated I mean I was standing at

249
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,420
black hat a few years ago with a friend

250
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,400
who's been around for a long time we

251
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,860
were looking out at a sea of vendors not

252
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,630
one of which was one of the vendors out

253
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,150
in the hall here but a sea of vendors

254
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,120
and he said you know not one of these

255
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
vendors is making a promise that they

256
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,610
can keep because what they promise is to

257
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:13,830
see

258
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,610
cure your system and they can't do it so

259
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,000
the antivirus app that we spend millions

260
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,970
buying may very well stop eighty percent

261
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,650
or so of the virus is coming at us

262
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,060
because you can't stop it until you've

263
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,830
seen it and written a signature to block

264
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,260
it in the meantime the one you didn't

265
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,580
know and didn't write a signature to

266
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,130
block may have already owned you and

267
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,610
once you are owned you are owned so what

268
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,530
he is saying is that the hacker

269
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,170
community this is a kind of prototype of

270
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,090
what I want to suggest is possible for

271
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:48,210
small as well as large groups hackers in

272
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,360
the aggregate have forced an entire

273
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,820
industry worth millions of dollars to

274
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,440
create and sell a product which

275
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,500
everybody buys and which does not work

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,470
in doing what it says it will do

277
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,340
perimeter defense often is marketed the

278
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,240
same way so how can you pay attention to

279
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,060
the emergent behaviors that come out of

280
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,480
the advances the technology causes in

281
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,850
our societies and how can you control

282
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,710
your response to it very very hard

283
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,210
problems because what it really mandates

284
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,160
that you will do the next step of

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,280
recognizing this is that after you build

286
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,520
a small group of trusted people using

287
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,040
whatever handles you want you can try to

288
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,860
create multiple nims or personas or

289
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,950
hacker handles or multiple personalities

290
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,440
but you can bet in fact I can tell you

291
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,930
for sure that the powers that be have

292
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,450
worked very hard at making sure they

293
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,670
know how to connect those seemingly

294
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,730
disparate and separate identities so

295
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,920
that they can find the meta identity IE

296
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,490
you whoever or whatever you are and link

297
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,910
those behaviors that seem separate or

298
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,000
anomalous into one congruent hole so you

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,620
have to be aware that that is already

300
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,230
being done how can you build small

301
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,250
trusted khabar rother ease you have to

302
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,060
first create multiple trails of forensic

303
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,190
evidence simple nomads didn't talk at

304
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,530
Def Con oh I don't know about five or

305
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,720
six or seven years ago in which he

306
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,329
talked about the tedious but necessary

307
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:30,809
a task of building a trail to the data

308
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:34,259
you have gotten ahold of and secured for

309
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,689
yourself that looks as if it was a

310
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,449
reasonable trail and a legal trail for

311
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:42,509
you to take so that when they come for

312
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:46,139
you you have plausible deniability about

313
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,119
how it is that you've got to know that

314
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:51,119
or on that or be able to do that in

315
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,279
other words when I say plausible

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,230
deniability you know that this has been

317
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,660
a hallmark of the way governments

318
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,410
operate for many years to have a whole

319
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,679
system which allows them to do things

320
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,199
which they can plausibly deny even

321
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,899
though like the elephant in the room

322
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:11,509
everybody knows they are doing it

323
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,059
example woman named Melissa mall at a

324
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,559
conference that I helped to organize on

325
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,779
ethics and intelligence back in the day

326
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,179
when rendition was just becoming a

327
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,549
common word for taking someone somewhere

328
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:26,459
else so they could be tortured according

329
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,110
to the rubrics of another country's

330
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,480
operating procedures she was going to

331
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,100
give a talk at the conference about

332
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,589
rendition and how it evolved and I

333
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,179
remember her sitting there with the text

334
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,309
of her speech all blocked out you know

335
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,660
what it looks like to have all the black

336
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,819
markings across it three-quarters of the

337
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,410
text was gone she said I'm not giving

338
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,929
the talk the CIA gutted the talk because

339
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,360
she had to submit the talk for approval

340
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,389
as it happened there wasn't one thing in

341
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,970
her talk that wasn't already in the new

342
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,850
york times in the washington post but

343
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,790
the fact that she as a person of the CIA

344
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,759
would say that it was so is what was

345
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,549
being prevented so let the newspapers

346
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,879
say what they want it can be denied so

347
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,069
that it's not officially sanctioned as

348
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,399
the truth but you have to operate on is

349
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,949
the truth that you know not the truth

350
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,379
that can be officially sanctioned as the

351
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,350
truth so you have to plan your strategy

352
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,199
you have to think big and you have to

353
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,720
think strategically because if you just

354
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,879
blunder into some situation out of the

355
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,819
goodness of your heart these days in

356
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,029
America you can find yourself paying for

357
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:38,399
it in paying a dear price and you don't

358
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
want to do that so you have to learn how

359
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:40,710
to do

360
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,120
us in a world in which there literally

361
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,580
are no more walls a friend of mine in

362
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,950
NSA says that's what people really need

363
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,300
to learn to think these so they're

364
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,940
asking the wrong questions the questions

365
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,460
are how do you get vibrantly today in

366
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,190
the 21st century given what we have how

367
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,750
do you live in a world without walls how

368
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,540
do you live knowing your lives are in a

369
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,870
very primary way transparent because

370
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,700
what the technologies we've invented

371
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,420
have done is socialized us as I said to

372
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,780
a different kind of context when they

373
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,330
first appear the technologies are very

374
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,310
visible when the telephone was first

375
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,950
invented by alexander bell it didn't

376
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,780
sound like what didn't sound like

377
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,300
anything it was a strange tinny sound

378
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,360
and even Bell didn't know how it was

379
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,070
going to be used when he was asked what

380
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,080
you could do with it he said well maybe

381
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,420
you can let the next town know that a

382
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,630
telegram is on its way now what that

383
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,910
says is that he had been socialized by

384
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,030
telegraphy to such a degree at that time

385
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,340
that he could think telegraphic Lee but

386
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,440
not telephonically even though he

387
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
invented the telephone because neither

388
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,370
he nor anyone else saw it as a personal

389
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,710
communication device and the most

390
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,930
visionary futurist of the day when asked

391
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,360
what might be done with this one said

392
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,940
quote I foresee a time when there will

393
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,690
be one telephone in every single city

394
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,550
that was about as far out as the horizon

395
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,380
he could see but as the telephone is

396
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,089
evolved into now it's on its way out

397
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,579
phones are literally becoming non funds

398
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,859
as they become portable computers wired

399
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,310
to us as we became nodes in a telephonic

400
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,050
network the telephone went into the

401
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,109
background it disappeared like the power

402
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,209
grid you don't say as you flip the

403
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,220
lights I'm turning on the power grid now

404
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,890
or plugging a toaster the way my mother

405
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,680
used to say when I was a child I'm on

406
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,550
long distance Shh we don't speak of long

407
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,230
distance because there is no distance

408
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,650
when the network connects us immediately

409
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,940
to one another so you have to see the

410
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,850
social context to which the technologies

411
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,910
have led

412
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,010
this is my favorite quote about what

413
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,570
they do this is Langdon winner a

414
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,460
computer scientist who said when we

415
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,610
invent a new technology Society also

416
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,920
invents the kinds of people who will use

417
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,520
it ie hackers were invented by the

418
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,340
technology as instantiations of the

419
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,890
possibilities it disclosed which

420
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,080
heretofore no one had been able to see

421
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,420
because only interaction with the

422
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,790
technology discloses the portals of

423
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,070
opportunity that the technologies

424
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,480
available to us society invents the kind

425
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,780
of people will use it over practices

426
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,100
relationships ways of defining people's

427
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,980
identities fall by the wayside new

428
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,920
practices new relationships and

429
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,720
underscore new identities take wed in

430
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,510
case after case the move to computerize

431
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,180
and digitize means many pre-existing

432
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,820
cultural forms go liquid it's wonderful

433
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,860
vivid image of holding something solid

434
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,900
in your hand that goes liquid and drips

435
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,120
through your fingers and disappears into

436
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,120
mist they lose their former shapes as

437
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,380
their retailored for computerized

438
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,660
expression and as these new patterns

439
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,210
solidify which I'm suggesting they do in

440
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,060
shorter and shorter generations both

441
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,980
youthful artifacts including the

442
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,160
cognitive artifacts of our minds and the

443
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,690
texture of human relationships the

444
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,730
surround them will be much different

445
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,300
from what previously existed this is a

446
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,680
way to say that what cyberspace is

447
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,870
created for us is a new way of being

448
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,920
human and we have so internalized it and

449
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
are continuing to internalize it that we

450
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,080
neglect to notice what has happened to

451
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,990
us because it is axiomatic so the way we

452
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,260
think and feel and behave it has

453
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,890
affected trust profoundly in the former

454
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,890
human physical domain trust was based on

455
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,160
competency on identity knowing who it

456
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,090
was it is not transitive and if it is

457
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,280
lost it is hard to gain in the cyber

458
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,350
world however it is based on only one

459
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,130
thing identity identity who someone says

460
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,400
that they are and today identity more

461
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,299
than ever is based not on assertion

462
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,090
who you say you are but on observation

463
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,029
observation only defines identity

464
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,450
because who you are is revealed by what

465
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,690
you do and what you do is a connection a

466
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,149
pattern of dots over time as they move

467
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,639
as Jennifer said this morning everything

468
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,519
you do you've seen the maps you seem to

469
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,980
cover little maps of people who have

470
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,080
mapped their telephone conversations

471
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,210
over a period of weeks and how you can

472
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,700
know damn near everything they did or

473
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,679
we're doing during those times that it's

474
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,499
so much more complex subtle

475
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,480
sophisticated than that so if you can

476
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,100
observe someone than you know who you

477
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,559
who they are now if the conditions have

478
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,299
been created is they were in America by

479
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,090
911 and the fear and the whole set of

480
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,850
policies that that engendered then what

481
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,070
becomes necessary is that you observe

482
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,580
people all the time in other words no

483
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,039
one could ever be off the grid without

484
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,169
becoming suspect no one could remove

485
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,749
themselves from life on the grid without

486
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:07,710
becoming at best antisocial and at worst

487
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,590
a person of interest who is considered

488
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,489
dangerous and it can happen so quickly I

489
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:16,590
was once invited by the FBI to keynote a

490
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,950
conference for several states in the

491
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,409
Midwest and just a few nights before the

492
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:23,759
conference I received one of those

493
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,179
wonderful 10pm calls from Special Agent

494
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,309
so-and-so who said I'm calling on behalf

495
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:31,619
of the FBI to disinvite you from doing

496
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:34,049
the keynote because we have discovered

497
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:35,639
that you advocate the use of illegal

498
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:38,580
hacking and we cannot have a person like

499
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,070
you keynote in their conference I said

500
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,119
oh really why do you think that and he

501
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,899
said we have emails from you advocating

502
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:51,389
illegal activity and where do you have

503
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:53,519
them from I said from your participation

504
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,080
in the forum we call 2600 I said not

505
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,649
having been born yesterday I don't send

506
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:05,820
emails to 2600 he said oh yes you do I

507
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,460
said do you have any evidence to this he

508
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,409
said yes your name is Richard theme

509
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,720
isn't it I said yes he said well these

510
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,730
emails are all using the hacker handle

511
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,269
which is obviously you

512
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,749
our time now I happen to know who our

513
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,999
time was he's a really bright guy does

514
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,029
some really nice network work now and he

515
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,679
lives in Madison Wisconsin about a

516
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,809
hundred miles from where I live and it's

517
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,279
not me at all but I happen to know that

518
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:32,859
was his name and I said that's not me

519
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,789
and he said there's that moment of

520
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,339
wonderful silence oh these are

521
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:44,109
people who have at their fingertips the

522
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:46,539
extraordinary resources to investigate

523
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,909
anyone they want and the inference to

524
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,039
which he jumped was that our theme must

525
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,519
be our time and on that basis he sent a

526
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,099
letter to all of the leading technology

527
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,269
people who were attending this

528
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,820
conference to explain that I couldn't do

529
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,889
the keynote because I advocated criminal

530
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:05,679
behavior and I asked him to send another

531
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,929
letter to all those people and clean it

532
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:14,109
up which he didn't do because he didn't

533
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,279
have to so I did and then they thanked

534
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:21,159
me so much for not embarrassing them by

535
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,809
revealing what an idiot their person was

536
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,359
if they had observed my behavior they

537
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,219
may have seen something that caused them

538
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,619
to be aroused or interested but it

539
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,059
certainly wasn't going to be at that

540
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,239
point my life emails advocating criminal

541
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,789
behavior said to an organization that I

542
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,979
knew was so infiltrated by their own

543
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,469
agents that nothing in it took place

544
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:48,039
without their knowledge observation not

545
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,809
assertion that means you have to see

546
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,999
across the entire grid of space-time or

547
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,839
an old speak time and space but you have

548
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,969
to see what smartphone see you have to

549
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,619
see with GPS see you have to see what

550
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:02,349
trackers enable and see the maps of

551
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,209
actions and behaviors which every

552
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,889
electronic transaction in which you

553
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:08,349
engage becomes a part of whether its

554
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,179
buying something or going somewhere

555
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,629
traveling somewhere any purchase over a

556
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,269
few bucks at all which must be made that

557
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:19,690
way every phone call every communication

558
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,909
that's electronic now every email and

559
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:23,979
the laws in the united states have now

560
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,289
allowed warrantless surveillance on the

561
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,989
basis

562
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:30,729
Association primarily and above all as

563
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:34,330
good as the depth reached by the kinds

564
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,720
of programs that are used it is still

565
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,299
suspicion of guilt by association that

566
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,340
is you talk to so and so talk to so and

567
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,649
so talk to so and so and the rubric

568
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,049
someone said long ago we have all talked

569
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,470
to bad people has to be neglected

570
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,229
because there is still to my knowledge

571
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:56,409
no better model for finding out whether

572
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:59,229
someone is dangerous or not so what

573
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:00,879
marketers are doing just to use a

574
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,399
trivial example is using real-time data

575
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:06,249
from social networks and responding

576
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:09,159
immediately in real-time ways to alter

577
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:12,249
or inflict the behavior of crowds which

578
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,109
is kind of what Dave I tell was saying

579
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:16,299
Mudge was saying and is keynote in a

580
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,799
slightly different way instead of it

581
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,259
being the whole hacker community when

582
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,289
the head is moving and and we know that

583
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,169
a Twitter can Stampede the herd then to

584
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:28,929
notice that the herd is moving this way

585
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:31,710
and choose to inflict its behavior is

586
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,239
necessarily going to be an emergent

587
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,429
property of those who want to manipulate

588
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,129
and manage the mind of society this is

589
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:41,769
not a conspiracy theory it's just what's

590
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,960
done so I've talked to people who have

591
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,779
done really good studies academia is

592
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,519
lock stock and barrel in this world

593
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,779
studies of which words we can use to

594
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,669
change behaviors because certain

595
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,460
keywords they have discovered when

596
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,649
introduced into conversations online

597
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:03,249
will cause that conversation to move or

598
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:05,769
inflect in a particular direction so the

599
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,109
intentional use it's a kind of inference

600
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,919
attack when you build the logic

601
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,059
implicitly in a narrative or

602
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,609
conversation which people unconsciously

603
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,519
respond to and follow then we become

604
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,349
what I used to call real birds in

605
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,690
digital cages but now with the ubiquity

606
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,919
of social networks they call it real

607
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,440
flocks of birds in digital cages because

608
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,779
we not only take our real lives into

609
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:31,720
those cages then knowingly we feel a

610
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,970
sense of false security by seeing wings

611
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,519
above us and to the side and below us

612
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,470
and so when we move in the herd of the

613
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,980
crowd of the flock we

614
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,020
false security and the cage is simply

615
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,570
bigger big enough to move the cage

616
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,380
slowly so that the entire flock moves to

617
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,660
feeling the illusion of the freedom of

618
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,490
flying because there's sufficient room

619
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,669
in the cage to beat its little wings let

620
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,020
me give you an example because I'm

621
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,580
trying to make the case that things are

622
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,890
simply not what they seem was years ago

623
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,510
when I first start writing about this

624
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,730
stuff that I wrote an article for dotnet

625
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,850
was the magazine in Great Britain and I

626
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,380
got an email from a guy hill and

627
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,020
knowlton a global public relations firm

628
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,330
and he said we think you could be very

629
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,700
useful to us come over after work for a

630
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,250
pint and I said I'm not in London i'm in

631
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,200
milwaukee wisconsin now that tells you

632
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,809
how long ago was that someone reading an

633
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,390
English article thought someone had to

634
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,280
be in England because we still located

635
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,049
people geographically according to where

636
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,240
we thought they must be by virtue the

637
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,100
magazine we read now we know that

638
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,460
everybody or anybody can be anywhere I

639
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,020
said maybe we can do it remotely what is

640
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,760
it you're interested in he said you

641
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,620
might be useful to us in this new thing

642
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,000
called the Internet in doing brand

643
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,309
defense as it give me an example of

644
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:47,990
grand defense he said well say we have a

645
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,330
client who's a tobacco company I said oh

646
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,299
I see you want me to build a website

647
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:56,799
which attacks which supports tobacco

648
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,450
defends your client he said no no no

649
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,429
because I didn't know how he thought yet

650
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,740
he said we want you to build a number of

651
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,919
websites attacking our client and what

652
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,660
will provide is just enough information

653
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,270
to make each of those websites credible

654
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,700
but none of them will have any smoking

655
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,140
gun that's going to cause any legal

656
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,540
problem for the client and then real

657
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,850
birds and digital cages when you collect

658
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,130
people into the conversation we can

659
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,980
inflict it and move it over here so the

660
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,290
conversation letting people express

661
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,919
their rage Wall Street whatever let

662
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,900
people express their rage by being

663
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,929
included in collectives the external

664
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,270
image of which they believe is real and

665
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:41,690
then we can alter their behavior as we

666
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,110
like so that the client is not damaged

667
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,860
by just fire and storming and wind and

668
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,070
loud noises so that's an example of what

669
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,870
I mean by real burr

670
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,900
in digital cages this was years ago this

671
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,740
is simply what's done we live in a world

672
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,800
without walls and unless we disguise

673
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,170
them our movements will be transparent

674
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,660
and if our movements are transparent and

675
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,170
lead to a persistent identity then we

676
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,720
are known now in the mind of society

677
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,270
when asymmetric threat was at Jennifer

678
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,680
the other keynote referred to asymmetric

679
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,800
threats and when terror attacks are a

680
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,650
primary fear which is used to manipulate

681
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,170
the political and economic lovers of

682
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,220
that society then who is a target

683
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,590
everyone is a target it's a smaller

684
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,220
version of what the deputy director of

685
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,679
SIGINT at the National Security Agency

686
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:45,020
said in a meeting it was the meaning of

687
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:49,309
top people and the person responsible

688
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,040
for building appropriate relationships

689
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,700
with American allies said it's very

690
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,230
important that we nurture these

691
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,770
relationships properly so that we have a

692
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,130
long-term trust with these allies and

693
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,740
the deputy director of SIGINT said

694
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,740
excuse me excuse me we don't have not

695
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,750
only do we not have friends we don't

696
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,490
have allies all we have our targets and

697
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,010
the murmur of approval was loud and

698
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,800
sustained that is everyone agreed with

699
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,550
that because everyone knew that was true

700
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,160
everyone was a target well in a society

701
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,370
in which the identity of a quote

702
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,490
terrorists unquote is essential then

703
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,270
everyone is potentially a target which

704
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,750
is why we now intercept all electronic

705
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,900
communications all visuals all chemical

706
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,900
signatures whatever we need to collect

707
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,080
in order to filter and parse them in

708
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,150
order to determine whether through

709
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,830
Association and the detection of

710
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,440
anomalies and patterns of behavior

711
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,830
anyone could be a threat the stories of

712
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,980
people who are unfortunately tortured by

713
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,789
mistake

714
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,470
just a few of those are in the public

715
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,879
domain now just a few torture is real

716
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:17,960
and torture is terrible you can make a

717
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,379
joke of it I know someone who

718
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:23,899
participated in it and he said jokingly

719
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,179
I guess black humor like in a hospital

720
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,429
he said you know you know who was really

721
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,519
fun to work with he said the is Beck's

722
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,809
the is Beck's were great to work with

723
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,080
you know why because it was a novel idea

724
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,119
to them that one of the purposes of

725
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:41,739
torture might be to get information and

726
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:44,690
I mentioned that to a really responsible

727
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,340
interrogator who done it for about two

728
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,070
decades and all he said was the u.s.

729
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,720
Beck's Jesus you ever work with the

730
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,220
Turks they want a confession it doesn't

731
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,989
need to be a crime you don't need to be

732
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:02,809
the perp but we need a confession so the

733
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:06,440
consequences of being one of those deer

734
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,599
in the forest that moves and therefore

735
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,929
is detected can be serious and it raises

736
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,080
the question if you're a hacker by which

737
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,580
I mean not only someone who breaks in

738
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,559
the systems I'm sorry someone who

739
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,179
manipulates systems of information

740
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:21,529
communication or to make them do things

741
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,029
for which they've not been designed or

742
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,889
intended but if you're someone who does

743
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,470
that sort of thing it's important to be

744
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,999
very canny very wise and remember that

745
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,940
there are nothing but targets there's

746
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,029
only this global view because it's

747
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,460
necessary given what technologies have

748
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,499
done what have they done to the

749
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,690
intelligence community one of the things

750
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,759
they have done is break identity down

751
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,129
into packets of information you know

752
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:54,289
that's what travels over the wires are

753
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:56,710
wirelessly its packets of information

754
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,359
discrete packets of information the

755
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,729
origin of which the destination of which

756
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,529
cannot be easily determined which is why

757
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,999
distinctions between foreign and

758
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:07,999
domestic went away I did a talk another

759
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:09,799
to talk to the FBI is just a month or

760
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,779
two ago and the special agent in charge

761
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,999
of the office in Chicago where I was

762
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:16,759
giving the talk said you know it's not

763
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,889
your grandfather's FBI or your father's

764
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:20,390
FBI he said we're

765
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,610
national police agency but we have to do

766
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,110
an awful lot of intelligence in other

767
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,510
countries now just as our own

768
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,540
intelligence agencies were formulated to

769
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,550
do their work only in other countries

770
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,980
but now find themselves unable to

771
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,680
distinguish the borders of Atlantic and

772
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,300
Pacific like two parentheses around

773
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
their lives used to bracket our lives in

774
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,970
a clear way but they don't anymore and

775
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,850
that's why things have radically shifted

776
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,740
and the scene was described to me in the

777
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,510
office of one of the directors of one of

778
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,600
the agencies when he said as a result of

779
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,400
the executive order coming from the

780
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,770
president directing them to do things

781
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,600
they had never before done the silence

782
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,680
he said was so thick in that office

783
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,960
because we were suddenly being told the

784
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,090
president authorized us to do things

785
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,699
which are whole professional lives and

786
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,350
by virtue of the conscience we had

787
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,168
developed in our work we believed could

788
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,730
not be done in America but now it is and

789
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,739
changing administration's you can't

790
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,960
blame bush you can't blame Obama you can

791
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,719
blame the structures of power that

792
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,239
mandate that certain behaviors must be

793
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,360
taken by people in authority given the

794
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,429
way the world has radically shifted in

795
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,610
the face of asymmetric threats and the

796
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,030
error is always going to be ideally for

797
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,449
these people on the side of not

798
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,090
excessive caution but making sure that

799
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,668
no threat is taken too lightly so the

800
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:51,469
primary goal of intelligence work has

801
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:54,380
really shifted in that in the absence of

802
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,668
foreign and domestic as meaningful

803
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:58,010
distinctions in the absence of knowing

804
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,840
where communications begin and end and

805
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,360
what is the ultimate destination and

806
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,490
intention and purpose for which someone

807
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,770
receives them and given the way actual

808
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,530
intelligence work really works in which

809
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,690
for example the Israelis may say they

810
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,070
don't work with the Saudis and the

811
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,410
Saudis to work with the aid Israelis but

812
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,630
they do and when Jonathan Pollard

813
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,150
delivered suitcases full of documents

814
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,170
that he took out of the skiff and

815
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,090
delivered to the Israelis his handlers

816
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,850
they weren't just used by the Israelis

817
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,910
our allies and friends in America they

818
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,930
were sold and bartered on

819
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,660
this exchange of the world for other

820
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,490
kinds of information because that's

821
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,109
simply the way it is done and so the

822
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:41,790
result for the intelligence community is

823
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,089
that in the trenches the nation states

824
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,010
which originally mandated what they

825
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,470
would do as the boundaries around those

826
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,839
nation-states themselves dissolve in the

827
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,619
face of meta national structures an

828
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,940
emergent property of the world I have

829
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,750
been describing they are not serving

830
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,339
those nation-states in the same way and

831
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,280
I suggested to the FBI special agent in

832
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,619
charge I said you find it makes a

833
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,599
difference in the behavior of the people

834
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,520
you're working with that they're no

835
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,890
longer beholden to the sources of power

836
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,990
and influence in the country that they

837
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,059
used to be and his response was that's

838
00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:20,040
how you know you're not crazy he said

839
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,430
bingo he said we appeal to patriotism a

840
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,829
lot and while people still feel they

841
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,839
want to do the patriotic thing that is

842
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,460
that thing which has as a point of

843
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,410
reference what is good for America they

844
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,050
in fact behave differently now he said

845
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,299
because they may work for a company

846
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:41,460
named one Microsoft Cisco Oracle whose

847
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,559
products while you may think of them as

848
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,240
an American company are many national

849
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,280
and do more business outside of the

850
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,980
United States than they do inside so

851
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,960
they feel conflicted but they act

852
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,299
according to their real self interest

853
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:57,000
because we all know what it is and it is

854
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,859
to serve the culture organizational

855
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:01,559
structure for which we work and if you

856
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,750
don't you don't advance the unwritten

857
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,819
but known rules are the most important

858
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:07,859
in any organization and when you go to

859
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,569
work for an organization and begin to be

860
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:11,760
assimilated by the culture you learn the

861
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,290
more had better learn them pretty

862
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,839
quickly because those are the ones that

863
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,130
count so what's happened to intelligence

864
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,829
there's a new de facto Commission for

865
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:24,569
all of the actual intelligence

866
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:26,579
operatives in the world it is the

867
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,609
function as a thermostat in the global

868
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:32,339
community which is threatening always in

869
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,500
everywhere like any chaotic system to

870
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,359
burst out through this aperture or that

871
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,250
this foam bubble or that might break

872
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,819
into chaos and just to make sure that

873
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:44,390
that chaos doesn't break out so it

874
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,180
has become globally a kind of thermostat

875
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,299
to detect the threat of chaos in order

876
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,400
to ameliorate it by the exchange of data

877
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,650
which pacifies the world temporarily

878
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:04,430
momentarily you get the point and so the

879
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,440
real job of an intelligence agent these

880
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,170
days is to serve a global structure and

881
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,380
the real job is to be able to assure

882
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,630
people kind of that the world in which

883
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,670
you wake up tomorrow morning will be

884
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,529
pretty much like the world in which you

885
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,410
went to sleep in other words your goal

886
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,650
is the amelioration of fear and the

887
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,859
amelioration of real danger and the

888
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,460
pacification of anxiety and the subdue

889
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,730
of the potential threat that may derail

890
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,680
the stability which serves the

891
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,109
aggregated self interests of the real

892
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,849
sources of power and influence in the

893
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,319
world because that's how it always is

894
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,400
done so what has this all done to you to

895
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,430
your identity who are you let me give

896
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,049
you some quotes from Wall Street Journal

897
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:53,150
article on the really smart phone i did

898
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,069
a talk not long ago for econ which is

899
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,470
was really smart people talking about

900
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,309
the emergent telecom and internet calm

901
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:04,640
and mobile com things that were coming

902
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,970
and what they really were describing was

903
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,779
you can get ahold of this a context rich

904
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:17,269
highly personalized environment in which

905
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,160
the feedback loops i talked about people

906
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,349
inflecting the behavior of crowds the

907
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,140
feedback loops are so immediate to you

908
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,019
and so personally directed based on who

909
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:28,700
you are what you like who you hang out

910
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,319
with and where you are and all the

911
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:31,579
things that you know you are giving away

912
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:33,470
now by participating in the electronic

913
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,140
world that the context rich feedback

914
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,630
loops will immediately include you in

915
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:41,089
the desired behavior now thats egg is

916
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,910
coming from some world government or

917
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:45,140
marketers someone said to a friend of

918
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,930
mine works at CIA years ago be very

919
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,660
careful do you want one big brother or

920
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,869
many big brothers think carefully before

921
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,720
you choose that was 10 years ago and he

922
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,530
said the other day

923
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,450
a there's no point in choosing anymore

924
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,210
we have both so what this article said

925
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,190
was that by observing the millions of

926
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,070
data points produced by millions of

927
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,520
people using their smartphones not by

928
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,560
intercepting the conversations but by

929
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,240
merely observing the patterns of

930
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,490
behavior their location their movement

931
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,960
and tracking those in the aggregate

932
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,790
because they're dealing with millions of

933
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,290
data points the patterns they form

934
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,710
reveal the human behavior at heart that

935
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,780
data can reveal for example subtle

936
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,300
symptoms of mental illness they could

937
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,620
tell in an epidemic was hitting at

938
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,860
college campus before any of the kids on

939
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,370
the campus knew they were sick because

940
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,280
their behavior was altered and how they

941
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,800
moved was altered they can chart the

942
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,870
spread of political ideas as they move

943
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,310
through a community like it contagious

944
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:53,000
virus in Belgium cell phone data exposed

945
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,210
the cultural split driving a historic

946
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,060
political crisis there they could tell

947
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,530
when two people were talking about

948
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,720
politics even though they didn't know

949
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
the content by analysing changes in

950
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,320
their movement and communication

951
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,620
patterns and said dr. pentland from MIT

952
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,470
human dynamics laboratory who did some

953
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,460
of this research phones know people can

954
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,100
get this god's eye view of human

955
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,860
behavior after analyzing more than 16

956
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,470
million records of cell phone date time

957
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,150
and position they determine the taken

958
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,650
together they follow a mathematical

959
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,080
pattern and with enough data from past

960
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,120
movements they can forecast someone's

961
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,830
future whereabouts with ninety three

962
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:37,640
point six percent accuracy for us people

963
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,650
look like little particles that move in

964
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,990
space and occasionally communicate with

965
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,120
each other we have turned society into a

966
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,630
laboratory think of the large companies

967
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,840
social networks where behavior can be

968
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,240
objective we followed it's not just

969
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,850
about observing what is happening so it

970
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,430
goes beyond the identity question it is

971
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,470
about shaping what is happening these

972
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,760
patterns allow us to learn how to

973
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,800
manipulate trends opinions and mass

974
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,310
psychology so when you get data because

975
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,120
what is the purpose

976
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,830
of getting information about a person

977
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,840
place or object or thing or organization

978
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,150
if it's not going to be used it becomes

979
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,100
imperative not to use it in a way that

980
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,140
calls attention to how you got it in

981
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,570
Cincinnati a little while ago a porter

982
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,550
hacked into voicemail and got the

983
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,990
voicemail of the executives that she

984
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,480
Chiquita banana company and then he used

985
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,910
those and then it was so obvious that he

986
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,290
had used those because that was the only

987
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,360
place he could get them that he went to

988
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,840
jail and the perps the criminals whose

989
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,840
behavior he was reporting went free you

990
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,550
all know about the news of the world and

991
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,670
attended scandals going on with

992
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,650
journalism as it's called in Great

993
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,810
Britain and the way that is taking place

994
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,880
the problem is that the information was

995
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,730
used in a way that said this is where we

996
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,680
must have gotten it and that calls

997
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,990
attention and denies plausible

998
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,540
deniability if you get information the

999
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,600
trick is to use it in such a way that as

1000
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,210
I said as simple nomed mapped for us

1001
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,310
it's probably online somewhere you have

1002
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,850
to build a trail of reasonable approach

1003
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,760
to the data that was legitimate so that

1004
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,190
that is the forensic evidence on your

1005
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,380
computer which is subsequently examined

1006
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,690
and not what you did in the first place

1007
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,550
to get the data which may or may not

1008
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,100
have been legal now I'm talking as if

1009
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,180
I'm talking to hackers you know you know

1010
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,230
you know what's happened to the term

1011
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,710
it's hard to use in biohacking they now

1012
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,610
call it DIY bio why because the word

1013
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,380
hacking had been so distorted by the

1014
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,500
media use of it to mean bad people that

1015
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,730
they didn't want to be associated with

1016
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,420
biohacking their DIY bio but their

1017
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,140
biohackers and they're playing with

1018
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,330
genetics and synthetic biology and

1019
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,370
splicing attributes and making cameras

1020
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,210
and that sort of thing it's really

1021
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,060
interesting and it's where the next big

1022
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,890
movement I believe is going to go marker

1023
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,900
of which is Bill Gates saying if I were

1024
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,700
starting today as a young man I would be

1025
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,430
in biology Ted Knight with a PhD in

1026
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,110
engineering at MIT going back and

1027
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,790
getting a PhD in biology and building

1028
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,100
BioBricks or modular script kiddie like

1029
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,570
units that people can download so you

1030
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,600
don't have to reinvent the smell of

1031
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,180
pineapple can just download the modules

1032
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,120
it triggers it why do you want pineapple

1033
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,600
not just because you're hooked on pine

1034
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,580
but because if there's our cynic in

1035
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,110
something then you want to easily

1036
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,540
detected symptom of that and pineapple

1037
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,880
smell or something like it is obvious

1038
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,710
when the president of MIT almost a

1039
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,620
decade ago a woman was chosen whose PhD

1040
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,780
in background was in biology it doesn't

1041
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,760
take a weatherman as the song says to

1042
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,930
know which way the wind is blowing so

1043
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,180
you have to use this stuff in a way that

1044
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,270
no one notices in other words what must

1045
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,010
be under control which is sometimes

1046
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,800
tough for a young hacker is ego it's

1047
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,130
just like the Buddha say the lessee go

1048
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,770
the better the way to control the world

1049
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,690
Jung soo said is by simply allowing

1050
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,750
things to take their course when a

1051
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,000
leader is effective what the people say

1052
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,660
is look at what we did they do not call

1053
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,890
attention to the leader and the leader

1054
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,780
does not call attention to him or

1055
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,940
herself the leader dissolves into the

1056
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,000
fabric of the work that was done and

1057
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,450
disappears as both a source or target

1058
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,290
because they know how to use soft power

1059
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,970
people who crow about their exploits and

1060
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,800
what they have done and put it online

1061
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,110
are amateurs they are adolescent it is

1062
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,420
the ego speaking but if you can manage

1063
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,430
the ego because you have a bigger

1064
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,710
strategy in mind which is really doing

1065
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,540
something decent something good

1066
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,610
something on behalf of humanity

1067
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,320
something that recovers something of the

1068
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,930
dignity and what we used to call freedom

1069
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,390
and the power that is at the heart of

1070
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,720
real hacking then you are not going to

1071
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,610
call attention only to yourself think

1072
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,250
Julian Assange think of how he does it

1073
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,470
private Manning leaked a lot of

1074
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,740
documents to Wikileaks so now inevitably

1075
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,110
we must see the instantiation of

1076
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,830
WikiLeaks 2 point 0 which someone in

1077
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,770
Europe told me was well underway quite a

1078
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,380
while ago which is not just a non and

1079
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,870
lols an anti-sex sorts of activities but

1080
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,390
the actual use of cadres and intentional

1081
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,760
hackers not to ask the government for

1082
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,740
information that they know will not be

1083
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,900
forthcoming and get themselves on a list

1084
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,609
but to go get it

1085
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,450
and then to study with maturity like dan

1086
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,579
ellsberg also mentioned by jennifer this

1087
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,339
morning how to do the right thing

1088
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,910
appropriately in order to create a

1089
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,279
better kind of world than one with so

1090
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:54,869
many people in that case we're being

1091
00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:01,200
slaughtered ego is the enemy information

1092
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,299
is power and hackers go after power

1093
00:47:05,299 --> 00:47:08,309
there are three kinds of hackers we are

1094
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:12,119
told black hat hackers grey hat hackers

1095
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,079
and white hat hackers and i'm sure you

1096
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,880
know the real distinctions between them

1097
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,789
a black hat hacker is a hacker a grey

1098
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:27,720
hat hacker is a hacker who knows when to

1099
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,009
fudged the truth a white hat hacker is a

1100
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:34,140
hacker who put the truth down somewhere

1101
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,749
and forgot where he put it you got it

1102
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:42,890
they're all hackers

1103
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:51,240
thank you mother so an important part of

1104
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,210
the task if you're going to get into

1105
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,859
information also might include

1106
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,740
falsifying information delivering a

1107
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,450
payload that does things that don't no

1108
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:04,890
one expects it to do life today is just

1109
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,310
one big Turing test and what I'm going

1110
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,990
to suggest you need to do is develop the

1111
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,540
whole mind that wonderful talk we just

1112
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,540
heard on travel and hacking Airlines

1113
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,330
I've improves the point that hackers

1114
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:22,070
like all scientists are passionate

1115
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,609
daring and obsessive as I listened to

1116
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:28,349
this gentleman described millions of

1117
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:30,869
miles of flying and cleverly engineering

1118
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,030
the system gaming the system to squeeze

1119
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,099
every last drop of efficiency on his

1120
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,920
behalf out of it I thought to myself for

1121
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,930
the millionth time I've never met anyone

1122
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,260
who's really interesting who wasn't

1123
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,710
obsessive it's really that simple

1124
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,080
hackers have to be obsessive you have to

1125
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,670
be passionate but you have to use the

1126
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,970
whole mind Peter Newman who's at essar I

1127
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,910
still and all the way back to the

1128
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,940
multics days he said how rare it is to

1129
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,619
get a computer engineer that has both

1130
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,900
left brain and right brain capabilities

1131
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,930
who not only knows how to draw the lines

1132
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,480
but knows how to add the color and knows

1133
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,270
how to synthesize who knows how to

1134
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,369
integrate who knows how to get the

1135
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:17,820
details right but also can see the big

1136
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,330
pictures it also requires passionate

1137
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,300
self-knowledge listen to a CIA profiler

1138
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,609
who describe to me what it took to be

1139
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:29,280
mindful of the Buddhists we always go

1140
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,339
there in the end mindful and vigilant

1141
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,550
this is what it took to be mine mindful

1142
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,339
she said to be conscious attend to the

1143
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,460
data she said looking for perps in

1144
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,920
network intrusion she said this minute

1145
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,070
is the serial killer or hacker disregard

1146
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,320
everything you think you know and look

1147
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,030
at the data because otherwise would be

1148
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,650
wrong she is the case of the DC sniper

1149
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,200
at that time and they were all wrong

1150
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,720
about how they profiled the DC sniper

1151
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,480
the network patterns will be a series of

1152
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,520
behavior like we're saying that will

1153
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,760
lead you to who you want to go for

1154
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,680
information security this approach is

1155
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,099
sophomoric the data will tell you what

1156
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,720
someone is doing what they left behind

1157
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,150
focus on the evidence but what this

1158
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,490
requires is intense concentration she

1159
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,670
said in constant self-monitoring because

1160
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,550
the degree of clarity transparency

1161
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,750
required is great if you have a

1162
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,520
stereotype in mind she said I always

1163
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,400
blew it and so I learned to not form a

1164
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,380
pattern too quickly whatever I found

1165
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,570
myself thinking I learned to step back

1166
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,420
and say Who am I to believe that what is

1167
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,130
the data that tells me that that might

1168
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,470
be true what is the hypothesis in other

1169
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,599
words have your beliefs but don't

1170
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,560
believe too strongly in your beliefs it

1171
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,349
is usually someone who does not fit the

1172
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:52,890
pattern now let me give you some

1173
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,470
examples of the world in which we work

1174
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,260
we don't have too much time but what I

1175
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,840
mean by having to work hard to see the

1176
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,000
context so you can respond appropriately

1177
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,089
I once talked to a young man who had

1178
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:08,310
been to Haiti on a mission with the army

1179
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,460
encounter intelligence in order to

1180
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,609
interdict a cartel that was moving drugs

1181
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:17,310
cocaine mostly heroin mostly cocaine

1182
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,650
through Haiti at that time was the clear

1183
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,869
channel in the United States and he took

1184
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,760
seriously because he was a good-hearted

1185
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,230
young guy and he was with the Army

1186
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,760
counterintelligence unit and they were

1187
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,380
going to stop these guys from doing it

1188
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,089
when he got to Haiti he found there was

1189
00:51:30,089 --> 00:51:31,320
a condition of political instability

1190
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,690
shall we say which is not an uncommon

1191
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,359
thing to find in Haiti and he was

1192
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,650
worried they wouldn't be able to fulfill

1193
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,230
their mission so when he heard that an

1194
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,760
associate of the president was coming

1195
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,670
down he really felt very very grateful

1196
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,380
because he assumed he was coming down to

1197
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,869
shore up the mission and he said what am

1198
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:51,690
I to do he came down to make sure the

1199
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,650
cocaine came through he wanted to make

1200
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,550
sure it kept going to where it was going

1201
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,720
where I was going was a little town

1202
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,830
you've probably never heard of called

1203
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:04,920
maina Arkansas but that's neither here

1204
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,560
nor there and the fact that he was from

1205
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,750
Arkansas is neither here nor there and

1206
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,779
that it was in the 90s

1207
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:13,469
neither here nor there it's just that

1208
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:16,359
the mission he thought he was doing was

1209
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:19,449
totally undermined by the real mission

1210
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:21,219
and the real self interest of in that

1211
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:24,819
case people of particular power it's not

1212
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:26,169
uncommon to run into this when you're

1213
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:28,929
doing this kind of work a guy waited

1214
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:31,239
after one of these talks a few years ago

1215
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:33,400
he worked for one of the stock exchanges

1216
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,769
in New York and he was doing intrusion

1217
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:38,229
detection it's doing great job detecting

1218
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:40,179
intrusions snap Harry here's intrusion

1219
00:52:40,179 --> 00:52:42,400
here's one this door is broken this lock

1220
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,279
is Jimmy this window is broken and he

1221
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,499
would show his results to the powers

1222
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:48,789
that be and they said you're doing a

1223
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:49,959
great job he said you know we really

1224
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,549
need to ramp this up to intrusion

1225
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:54,039
prevention we can stop some of this from

1226
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,239
happening they said no you're doing a

1227
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,249
fine job just keep doing what you're

1228
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:59,559
doing we found out of course that the

1229
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,109
intrusions were sometimes done by the

1230
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:04,390
people on the board of the exchange in

1231
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,400
order to get insider information from

1232
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,709
the computing system on which they could

1233
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:10,509
then subsequently trade and the reason

1234
00:53:10,509 --> 00:53:12,880
he didn't want him to ramp it up was

1235
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,390
because that would interdict their

1236
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,849
self-interest once again he said to me

1237
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,979
that crossroads you come to if you have

1238
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:22,869
a conscience and you care about

1239
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,179
integrity and wholeness and doing the

1240
00:53:25,179 --> 00:53:27,609
right thing which the hacker ethos is

1241
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:31,869
predicated on you being he said what am

1242
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:34,630
I going to do sometimes you have to go a

1243
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,519
little deeper than what the facts look

1244
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,779
like we used to have a group in America

1245
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:39,909
called the Symbian East Liberation Army

1246
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:42,699
was headed by a gentleman by the name of

1247
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:46,299
sync way his assistant was William wolf

1248
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:50,919
I what was this nickname Khufu global I

1249
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:55,140
don't know Lobo something wolf sync way

1250
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,779
kidnap patty hearst and they did a very

1251
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:00,609
efficient and very effective job of

1252
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:03,429
quickly brainwashing her so that she

1253
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:05,169
joined the symphony Liberation Army

1254
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:08,289
ended time in jail because of her bank

1255
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:12,159
robbery the question was never asked

1256
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,979
where did these guys learn how to be so

1257
00:54:14,979 --> 00:54:18,789
good at that kind of brainwashing we

1258
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,189
just just connect the dots you learned

1259
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:23,650
that they both and their cohorts were in

1260
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,610
vacaville state

1261
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,130
isn't in California and then you have to

1262
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,660
learn that there was a covert CIA

1263
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,850
program in learning how to do

1264
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,250
brainwashing and the prisoners at that

1265
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,050
prison could get time off for

1266
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,720
volunteering for that program and that

1267
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,420
guess what the gentleman who were in the

1268
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,640
simba nice liberation army had all

1269
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,800
volunteered to participate in a program

1270
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,860
that taught them by doing to them how

1271
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,950
effectively brainwashing could be done

1272
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,450
this is an example of what we call

1273
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:55,090
blowback when you do an omission or

1274
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,520
operation which has consequences that

1275
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,460
blow back into your face another one

1276
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,170
like that when Alexander Haig was

1277
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,210
Secretary of State he read an article in

1278
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,590
The New York Times about a book that was

1279
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,870
coming out about the KGB sponsoring

1280
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:09,790
terrorism all over the world and

1281
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,220
guerrilla warfare and he just went crazy

1282
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,560
and he took the public podium as he was

1283
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,020
his egotistical want and demanded the

1284
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,510
CIA do something about it the CI said

1285
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,250
will attend to that at once and director

1286
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,790
of CIA so I'll look into it and six

1287
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,230
months later they came back and said

1288
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,390
we've taken care of it and don't worry

1289
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,880
about it the reason he was told not to

1290
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,550
worry about it is because the article

1291
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:36,280
New York Times about the book was based

1292
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,020
on an article in a small Italian

1293
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,600
newspaper and the Italian newspaper was

1294
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,810
the CIA proprietary a proprietary means

1295
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,430
it was covertly owned and operated by

1296
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:47,200
the CIA to do something other than what

1297
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,310
it looks like it was doing which was

1298
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,090
being a newspaper many of them are one

1299
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,400
way or another in the heyday before the

1300
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,850
pikin church committee meetings we know

1301
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,590
that between two and three hundred key

1302
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,410
reporters were in the payroll we know

1303
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:04,480
that the major people at CVS and New

1304
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,830
York Times and so on had signed

1305
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:09,450
contracts with the CIA to do the work

1306
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,990
what I'm suggesting is that hackers if

1307
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,400
they're going to take their work

1308
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,700
seriously as a collective group have to

1309
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,700
become a kind of Fifth Estate a kind of

1310
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,920
Fifth Estate we refer to the press in

1311
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,960
America is the Fourth Estate because

1312
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,700
that's the place that's supposed to keep

1313
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,220
the malfeasance in the government and

1314
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,520
other systems honest but when the media

1315
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,710
is owned by five or six people globally

1316
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,650
one way or another

1317
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,779
has become part of that system so that

1318
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:43,589
you have a military-industrial education

1319
00:56:43,589 --> 00:56:47,220
entertainment media complex in effect

1320
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,880
where the nexus of power and influence

1321
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,369
one hand washing another then the Fourth

1322
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:55,410
Estate isn't doing its job and the Fifth

1323
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,529
Estate that hasn't inevitably emerged in

1324
00:56:58,529 --> 00:57:01,470
response is a WikiLeaks type operation

1325
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,920
to out the malfeasance and the only way

1326
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,049
some hackers think they can do that is

1327
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,609
to get their hands on the information

1328
00:57:08,609 --> 00:57:12,260
and somehow learn to protect themselves

1329
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,690
protect themselves so what it actually

1330
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:17,579
happened with that story of course was

1331
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,309
that it was a lie about the KGB the CIA

1332
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:22,559
had planted it in the proprietary in the

1333
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,049
newspaper Italian reporters had picked

1334
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:26,789
up on admitted a bigger story New York

1335
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:28,170
Times picked up on it made it a bigger

1336
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,779
story authors based their forthcoming

1337
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:34,619
book on those stories and so it alarmed

1338
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,539
Alexander Haig who called for something

1339
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:38,400
to be done about something which had

1340
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,130
originated as just one of the many

1341
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,180
stories planted in one of the many

1342
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,670
vehicles or apertures into the mind of

1343
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,180
society so the birds would fly in a

1344
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:56,250
particular way I have no I only have a

1345
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,339
few minutes what a shame because I love

1346
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,880
this stuff there are other examples and

1347
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,150
some of them are even sexier but be

1348
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,789
aware of who it is you are becoming

1349
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,859
stand back from who it is the

1350
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,349
technologies mandate you to be and try

1351
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:16,799
to game the system like the airline guys

1352
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,710
did by getting all the information you

1353
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,569
possibly can because the way you degrade

1354
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:24,480
a group or sell in counter-terror is to

1355
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,400
elevate the importance of someone who's

1356
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,200
not important to grade the importance of

1357
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,490
someone who is and above all turn

1358
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,920
somebody into a formant so how do you

1359
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,020
know that your comrade is a trusted

1360
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,940
comrade how do you know the group hasn't

1361
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,650
been infiltrated you know that so much

1362
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,380
police work is done simply by informants

1363
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,890
and using people Lyndon Johnson said

1364
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,299
Trust is when you've got him by the

1365
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:48,690
balls you know he he was a man who

1366
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,039
seemed to know what he was talking about

1367
00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:51,530
he got more legislation

1368
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,210
than the better hearted presidents

1369
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,390
before and after him so your identity

1370
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:59,300
really is your destiny because who you

1371
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,250
think you are creates the context of

1372
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,530
your life in a way that creates what is

1373
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:05,300
possible for you and the future that you

1374
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,000
see is really how you hold yourself here

1375
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,400
and now as a possibility for action into

1376
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,650
the future there is no future it's a

1377
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,140
construction of reality by humans and it

1378
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,660
has been altered by technology because

1379
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,940
in so many ways do I have time to do

1380
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,650
this I'll do it really quickly if this

1381
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,840
is what we call the present and you're a

1382
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,180
master of this domain think of this is

1383
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,570
time do you know that even the Masters

1384
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:33,170
of the big big domains of knowledge and

1385
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,290
expertise don't have time to read all of

1386
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,210
the material currently being published

1387
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,140
in their field that's just a fact and so

1388
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,690
in terms of the present being

1389
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,470
consciousness of the knowledge in your

1390
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,110
field they're a little bit behind but in

1391
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,910
the other fields that line up with them

1392
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,850
they are way behind all of us live in

1393
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,310
the past in some ways some of us in all

1394
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,770
of the ways and therefore that's why the

1395
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,870
technology now mandates that the only

1396
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,900
kind of learning that makes sense is

1397
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,640
cross-disciplinary life long learning

1398
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,090
and that's why education has become that

1399
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:10,550
it can't ever stop but you can't simply

1400
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,820
master one domain without

1401
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,260
cross-referencing all the information

1402
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,820
you can get all the knowledge all the

1403
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,400
insight Jeff Ross said years ago the

1404
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,350
founder of Def Con there's too much for

1405
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:23,210
me to know so it's most important for me

1406
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,040
to know is what I don't need to know but

1407
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,630
that means I need to know who knows it

1408
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,810
so I can get it when I need it you know

1409
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:31,250
virtually the same thing was said when

1410
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,260
books were invented in the fifteenth and

1411
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,990
sixteenth centuries people thought

1412
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,790
inundated by information this has

1413
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,490
happened before so knowing how to build

1414
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,770
the filter appropriately and who to

1415
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:45,230
trust for your information as best you

1416
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,480
can determine this will create your

1417
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,510
group identity so you not merely have

1418
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,820
multiple nested identities as good

1419
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,420
hacker posses and groups do one hidden

1420
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,500
below the other but you have real

1421
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,800
firewalls between those identities so

1422
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,450
that you can't be outed when you

1423
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,060
don't want to be outed fixing your

1424
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,250
identity in relationship to a known

1425
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,339
social structure does not guarantee that

1426
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,920
you or any acting agent is embedded in

1427
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,010
that structure at the moment of action

1428
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,720
you see what I mean we all have multiple

1429
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,460
identities we are nodes in multiple

1430
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,890
interests intersecting networks but the

1431
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,359
only way to know who you are at the

1432
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:29,210
moment you act is on behalf of what

1433
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:31,070
network you are acting and what is the

1434
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,089
consequence of the action at that time

1435
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:37,760
so you have to know who you are as a

1436
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,700
packet of data so that disassembled you

1437
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,619
as information will integrate

1438
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,780
effectively with other packets of data

1439
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,180
in the same way because on the net and

1440
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,130
on the net is where we live most of the

1441
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,349
time these days one way or another we

1442
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:54,079
are packets of data and how we are

1443
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,839
assembled by others in their view is how

1444
01:01:56,839 --> 01:01:59,119
we will look there for who they think we

1445
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,970
are and your management of perception is

1446
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:05,359
therefore critical and important you

1447
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,609
have to manage how you appear in

1448
01:02:07,609 --> 01:02:09,740
multiple networks through the various

1449
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,160
nodes with which you have become or can

1450
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,950
be associated so understanding in

1451
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,750
advance the various permutations and

1452
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,839
combinations of those data packets that

1453
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:23,150
will constitute your action and

1454
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:26,630
determine in advance the pattern that

1455
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,810
you want people to see when they look at

1456
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:34,609
how you seem to be I'm just trying to

1457
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:36,829
describe as I finish what works I went

1458
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:38,569
to the Zen Center in San Francisco once

1459
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:41,510
and the monk came out and he bowed to

1460
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,819
the crowd and everybody being at the Zen

1461
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:45,230
Center instead of a hacker conference

1462
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,380
got up and bowed back and he said do you

1463
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,150
know why we bow here at his end center

1464
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:51,770
and people thought they were supposed to

1465
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:53,480
say something to sounded spiritual or

1466
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,740
religious they said oh we're

1467
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,900
acknowledging the Godhead in one of them

1468
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,880
and he took all of it beautifully like a

1469
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,220
good Zen monk should he said that's a

1470
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,510
beautiful answer but that's not quite

1471
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,250
what I'm looking for and he waited till

1472
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,599
everybody had exhausted their obvious

1473
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,060
answers and he said no the reason we bow

1474
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,420
is well seems seems that things worked

1475
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,960
better when you bow okay that became my

1476
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,180
definition for ever after if a practical

1477
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,670
spirituality

1478
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,650
is it the doing of which makes things

1479
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:22,480
for you and for the world simultaneously

1480
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,930
work better that's it develop those

1481
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,300
behaviors practice what it is you want

1482
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,660
to do name those behaviors because as a

1483
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,220
friend of mine who's whitewater kayaking

1484
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,470
said when you're doing white water

1485
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:37,480
rafting or kayaking and you're coming up

1486
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,900
to the rocks if you look at the rocks

1487
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,150
you'll hit the rocks but if you look at

1488
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,790
where the water goes you go where the

1489
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,610
water goes that's leadership seeing and

1490
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,830
saying clearly where the water goes so

1491
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:51,990
that other people spontaneously

1492
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:53,920
understand that you're telling the truth

1493
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,560
and align themselves with you so that

1494
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,900
you can practice doing that what you

1495
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,160
want to do when you don't have time to

1496
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,750
think the same guy was it add up to

1497
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,750
karate he was so good at it he practiced

1498
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,250
and practiced and practiced in one night

1499
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,840
he left the dark movie theater on

1500
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,790
midnight was walking to his car T for

1501
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:11,110
the hand come out of the darkness of

1502
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,720
gravity turned around broke the neck of

1503
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,700
his assailant except it wasn't an

1504
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,350
assailant it was a friend trying to stop

1505
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,830
them and say hello Ron and so he said to

1506
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:21,940
me the lesson I learned from that event

1507
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,920
is make sure that what you practice is

1508
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,260
what you want to do because when you

1509
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,850
don't have time to think what you do is

1510
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,640
what you have been practicing we used to

1511
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,970
call that formation of character

1512
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:35,110
choosing to do those things which you

1513
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,640
want to deeply internalized and become

1514
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,560
unconscious and habitual like about

1515
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,270
ninety eight percent of our behavior is

1516
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,970
so that it becomes the great iceberg of

1517
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,010
our life and it becomes who we are

1518
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,880
without even thinking about it I see if

1519
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,940
that the seconds are now going up which

1520
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:54,910
is probably a digital way of saying that

1521
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,340
the time has unfortunately come to a

1522
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,240
close so always more to say have mouth

1523
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,150
will travel my brother once said I was

1524
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,160
just like a catfish I said why is that

1525
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,140
he said a catfish is nine-tenths head

1526
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:12,150
and its head is nine-tenths mouth stone

1527
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,500
that's what brothers are for keep you

1528
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,000
honest so thank you for your

1529
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,480
attentiveness I have I have cards that

1530
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,880
if anybody wants it card taking care of

1531
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,670
so it's to say I have two books I'm not

1532
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,400
supposed to say but I just flew eight

1533
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,350
thousand miles I'm going to tell

1534
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,380
you

1535
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:37,469
okay i have qbooks islands in the

1536
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:39,390
clickstream what would i saw i only have

1537
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,279
a couple of copies of each i'm not going

1538
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:46,559
to carry many books what is it 1225 it's

1539
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,739
not durham here it's ringing right 25 of

1540
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:53,279
those and the other one mind games is 50

1541
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:55,349
of those those are both at my cost I

1542
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:56,849
have a couple if you want them signed

1543
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,920
you can of course get a much cheaper on

1544
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,839
the internet from for your kindle and

1545
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:03,420
whatever apparatus you you want to use I

1546
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,069
start writing fiction again about 10

1547
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,689
years ago and a friend at NSA said you

1548
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:08,130
can't ever discuss what we talked about

1549
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,839
with you unless you start writing

1550
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,699
fiction it's the only way you can tell

1551
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:15,089
the truth so I that's why I shifted from

1552
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:17,880
nonfiction to what we call fiction

1553
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,979
luckily you're a generation who can't

1554
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:23,699
easily distinguish between the two so if

1555
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:25,439
you want one of those books I give it to

1556
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,179
you at the mic costs don't have to carry

1557
01:06:27,179 --> 01:06:30,119
at home otherwise download it and of

1558
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,949
course being hackers you know you can

1559
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:35,429
find it free on the web if you want ok

1560
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:38,329
thank you very very much

1561
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,660
you
