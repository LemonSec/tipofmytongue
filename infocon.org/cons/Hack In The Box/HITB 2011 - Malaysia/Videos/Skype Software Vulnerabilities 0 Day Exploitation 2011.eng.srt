1
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,029
and today band will be talking about

2
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,170
skype vulnerability zero-day

3
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,869
exploitation 2011 please join me in

4
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:30,380
welcoming him thank you so like she told

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,479
it ago my name is Benjamin and today I

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,460
want to talk about skype exploitation

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,890
out of the box and in the last half year

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,290
we have done a lot of research around

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,559
skype and the software and we actually

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,079
discovering Werner abilities and a lot

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,809
of famous softwares so I try to exploit

12
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,480
also a skype software and could detect

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,089
and five months about six

14
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:54,980
vulnerabilities of the six

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,890
vulnerabilities I've got verified by the

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,820
skype security team and today I want to

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,849
present five vulnerabilities and based

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,159
on these vulnerabilities i also want to

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,140
explain the egg tax schemes which are

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,540
behind this specific a text to allow the

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,729
people later to research about and

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,470
exploit and let you people could try to

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,990
exploit it later on your own way basing

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,330
on the maps which are for example server

25
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,470
site exploitation of skype software and

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,980
yeah now i want to start to to make

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,580
clean some questions to answer some

28
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,620
questions ago because it's very

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,230
important to know about before

30
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,300
discussing about the attack schemes

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,320
which we provide now so how much at x

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,140
games we will be discovered today we

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,080
will be we will discover today about 68

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,400
x games on skype exploitation and this

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,480
six vulnerabilities are also based on a

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,400
different attack schemes which we also

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,670
will provide are the different schemes

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,340
verified or tested of the six schemes we

39
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,190
will be we will discover today and about

40
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,280
five got verified by the skype security

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,890
team based on the vulnerabilities we

42
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,470
have released to them because we do not

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,819
fold this closure how much our client

44
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:27,760
side how much our server side

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,110
so about three burner abilities our

46
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,079
server site located and both three our

47
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:41,040
local client site located so how are the

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,860
vulnerability so s independent three of

49
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,750
them are less independent means you

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,239
could exploit them under mac OS under

51
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,950
linux on windows but also three of the

52
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,540
vulnerabilities are four specific ways

53
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,269
the severity of the vulnerabilities the

54
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,859
server-side vulnerability is mostly

55
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,409
between medium and high the client-side

56
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,799
vulnerabilities mostly on a lower level

57
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,109
because of client-side exploitation

58
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,709
everybody knows that mostly we are more

59
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,659
interested in discovering server-side

60
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,359
vulnerabilities than in discovering for

61
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,040
example the client-side vulnerability

62
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,730
because the kids of the art of

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,170
exploitation because client-side

64
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,819
exploitation is much more easier than to

65
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,680
exploited on a server side or in

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,400
software side how much time that our

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,290
group needs to exploit and identify all

68
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,230
the vulnerabilities got identified

69
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,049
within about four months five months so

70
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,239
not much time to exploit for me so but

71
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,739
we tried it because a lot of people

72
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,840
trying to discover Werner abilities for

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
that but mostly the vulnerabilities are

74
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,060
client-side located so I'm this time we

75
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,340
will show the different attack schemes

76
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,870
to explain how the attack really works

77
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,260
we will start with the client-side one

78
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,879
for example if somebody is exploiting

79
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,149
anybody else on skype and the clients is

80
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,548
mostly an attack which could be sent

81
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,769
over a message for example but needs

82
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,389
user interaction because of the

83
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,840
client-side um mostly client-side

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,039
vulnerabilities are located in message

85
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,560
boxes for example I'm sending another

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,340
person at link which should be

87
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,200
redirecting to Google but if he is

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,849
clicking on this link it's not in a

89
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:40,700
right way

90
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,740
so you come for example to another

91
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,320
external website and this is client site

92
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,150
exploitation for example we show it in

93
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,880
the model then attacker is sending for

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,660
example a link to D it is connected to

95
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,670
the skype and in conversation and

96
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,700
ascending the other person a link he is

97
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,950
clicking on it with user interaction and

98
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,470
at the end the non-persistent script

99
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,050
code execution brings the person to for

100
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,770
example an external website this is the

101
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,040
most this is no evidence exploitation of

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,050
sky because client-side exploitation is

103
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:27,050
not my person with a target so so I'm at

104
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,100
second okay now I want to explain the

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,500
first server side back in the last month

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,650
a lot of press stuff is coming up

107
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,170
because of one of the researchers from

108
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,620
our lab which named lemon cayenne alias

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,260
matrix has released the vulnerability

110
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,250
inside of the profile area of the skype

111
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,040
of the skype software he included for

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
example a script kotak inside of the

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,150
profile my phone input field and later

114
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,450
it's getting executed from the active

115
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,750
the user list means I'm if I'm talking

116
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,300
to a person very often using my active

117
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,940
user list and out of this context the

118
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,010
script code is getting executed means if

119
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,170
I'm including a script tag into my

120
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,540
profile and talking to another person it

121
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,490
it's hijacking the sessions for example

122
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,130
on software side so um this

123
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,630
vulnerability was with an higher

124
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,610
priority when it was released a lot of

125
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,140
people are coming to us and asking us

126
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,030
hey man how you exploited it on server

127
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,650
side so um this is a good one but we

128
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,040
have them second server site

129
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,820
vulnerability which much more

130
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,910
interesting and vicky to exploit for

131
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,380
example this one is coming from

132
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,450
internally node because of the profile

133
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,730
which could be changed by the user and

134
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,080
could be exploited on a remote way for

135
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,830
example it could

136
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,470
lead to session hijacking execution of

137
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,410
malicious malicious content out of the

138
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,100
context of the preview listening and

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,870
yeah that's the vulnerability mostly

140
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,870
people including it on a profile and

141
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,680
exploiting their friends because they

142
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,520
are mostly active in the list so I'm

143
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,350
this vulnerability is also tricky to

144
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,890
detect because you you have to watch

145
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,570
over the next function which is

146
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,680
executing the code so I'm let's switch

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,940
to the second server site map second

148
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,590
server site map is much more difficult

149
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,900
to exploit like to include in strip

150
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,590
kotak on your profile um for example

151
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,990
this I have searched any software for a

152
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,050
specific node and when I registered the

153
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,820
first time to describe manager service

154
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,150
and I tried to register with a script

155
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,910
kotak as user name when I saw it's not

156
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,050
working because of a specific

157
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,990
restriction of the website and I'm

158
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,910
looking into my skype profile and

159
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,060
council tea service and I get we display

160
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,370
the message with my user name out of the

161
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,720
skype minute skype manager service and I

162
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,440
tried to if you for example if you're

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,090
registering with a script kotak there's

164
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,220
introspection but if you're logged in to

165
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,840
describe manager you could update the

166
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,210
username so i tried to include a script

167
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,580
kotek and council tea service and the

168
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,950
execution was in the status message far

169
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,640
of the kafka skype software means it's

170
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,500
not like in a preview model like in the

171
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,660
other server side like the other server

172
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,210
side vulnerability it's located directly

173
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,260
in the status status message bar of the

174
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,500
software which yeah which is not that

175
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,780
funny because people could exploit that

176
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,520
by inviting other persons for example to

177
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,070
to a specific skype manager conference

178
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,560
and this could lead to the execution of

179
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,160
the specific script code inside of me

180
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
inside of the software this is also am

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,940
very tricky back to exploit because you

182
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,320
have to to research a lot to Detective

183
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,350
owner ability inside of the software but

184
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,050
i'm looking for a note when

185
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,459
when I searched around the software I'm

186
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,160
looking for a specific way to have an

187
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,830
influence on this user name but when I

188
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,600
tried to register on this gap energy

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,519
service I could not execute it but when

190
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,800
I try when I was registered I could

191
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,290
update this user name too mm-hmm to a

192
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,279
specific script code which could be h

193
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,560
for example it could be HTML could be

194
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,680
also JavaScript so it doesn't depend

195
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,390
what you are including it's just as

196
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,060
executing out of the status bar and yeah

197
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,720
the third vulnerabilities and transfer

198
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,649
buffer overflow vulnerability um for

199
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,140
example if I'm if I'm unavailable I

200
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,930
couldn't recite any files so um I tried

201
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,040
to start with and friends and

202
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,560
conversation and was wasn't an

203
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,709
unavailable mode so the download wasn't

204
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,019
equerry so I changed to the unavailable

205
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,370
mode where you mostly couldn't turn

206
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,660
terrified but you could accept them um I

207
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,640
was switching out of this mode and going

208
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,110
into intimate transformative transfer

209
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,610
mode with the software and after that I

210
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,190
switched in standby mode after I

211
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,500
switched back in my active system I saw

212
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,990
the Sun buffer overflow which affecting

213
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,959
the end user which talking to me and but

214
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,140
also am also my local system that's

215
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,810
exploited by in buffer overflow means um

216
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,850
there's definitely a possibility to

217
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,560
override something but um skypers has a

218
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,310
lot of aunty debugging protect debugging

219
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,160
protections which they've allowed people

220
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,100
which are not it was to to have an

221
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,140
influence on the process by debugging in

222
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,290
this scenario we see and I started up in

223
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,690
conversation with a person and those

224
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,760
persons are connecting

225
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,240
connecting to skype and in in this

226
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,710
conversation when the transfer happens

227
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,160
the person one of the persons need to go

228
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,380
in and stand by morbid for example and

229
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,620
it's 64 bit system for windows and then

230
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,380
it's exploitable the next vulnerability

231
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,140
as a memory corruption inside of the

232
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,720
software skype has an dictionary finer

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,760
where you could for example search other

234
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,400
persons when i say i miss April Fool's

235
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,820
to the search other persons I try to

236
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,820
include a very large spring to check out

237
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,460
if the software is having and the inputs

238
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,660
but it has no party input so the

239
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,460
software is going down and the

240
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,700
vulnerability at the end was verified

241
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,790
for a mac OS and windows but it's not

242
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,010
exploitable under linux to make it clear

243
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,650
for everybody because i'm a lunar

244
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,830
ability we want to release is for

245
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,450
example OS independent and in this kind

246
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,670
of way both people are connecting to the

247
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,190
skype service and the person which this

248
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,140
model is locally it's not remote um

249
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,350
means you could just exploit the memory

250
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,660
corruption on your local system by your

251
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,790
own so um it's a nice buck but um it's

252
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:34,330
not remote now the Daniel of service and

253
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,150
the Daniel of service was located in the

254
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,080
status notification settings of the of

255
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,630
the message per means I'm for example if

256
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,380
you if you use the word Benjamin for

257
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,240
getting home and somebody writes you the

258
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,010
word you get not applied by Skype and

259
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,380
when I checked out the input fields I

260
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,890
have included also a large string to

261
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,270
check out if if the software is passing

262
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,750
for example the large request and this

263
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,720
vulnerability is localist exploitable

264
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,300
but when it's exploited the people could

265
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,040
also contact you and send you for

266
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,910
example one chair

267
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,220
and then the software is going

268
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,400
completely down means the exploitation

269
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,730
is locally but I'm after the locally

270
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,560
exploitation after the local

271
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,960
exploitation is possible to to remote

272
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,910
exploit it on a remote way hmm yes next

273
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,220
so these are discovered vulnerabilities

274
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,330
by me and my team and now I will show

275
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,490
some screenshots of the life

276
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,710
exploitations out of these sessions to

277
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,330
explain how the bugs are really working

278
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,490
and where they are located let's go for

279
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,060
example this is the vulnerability which

280
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,720
which has been detected by by 11 kyon

281
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,650
Ali a snob tricks he's from Germany and

282
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,390
he's the he has discovered the

283
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,430
vulnerability also on his website but he

284
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,470
discovered it over or vulnerability

285
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,680
laughs so we tried to research around

286
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,890
his back and the problem was that the

287
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,800
input has not been restricted or

288
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,400
validate of ours so the execution of the

289
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,980
of the code will not be happening in the

290
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,130
profile area but in the active profile

291
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,700
user listing means if you're if somebody

292
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,530
is near active list I want to try to

293
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,600
exploit you he could execute the script

294
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,820
code order of the preview listing which

295
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,850
is which been displayed on the main

296
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,310
context of the software means you you

297
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,130
could for example hijack the accounts of

298
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,890
the person or execute malicious code out

299
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,260
of the software which which is very

300
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,570
dangerous because if you if you could

301
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,580
execute script code or dirty software

302
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,130
anything is possible inside also this

303
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,830
one refer this park was completely OS

304
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,690
independent so you could exploit it on

305
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,550
the mac OS you could be exploited on the

306
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,190
windows it doesn't depend because him on

307
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,360
every version of this software the input

308
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,250
fields on the past anymore in there my

309
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:22,360
phone so this this was the area where i

310
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,460
included the second script code

311
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,499
execution when i was registering

312
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:30,159
to the service but i want to show that i

313
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,049
want to tell a difference between both

314
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,649
box because the profile vulnerability is

315
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,899
coming from internally service to an

316
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,759
internal yourselves because you're

317
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,039
including it on your local profile and

318
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,739
and the other vulnerability is coming

319
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,689
from an inbound sir vez for example to

320
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,359
describe manager and is also being

321
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,309
displayed later on the execution and the

322
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,099
status bar but this back is coming from

323
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:57,309
from an involved model to the to the

324
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,919
internet software the other

325
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:02,559
vulnerability and is from from

326
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,349
internally in turn to intern so um this

327
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:10,689
is the area where i try to update the

328
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,199
script code and and after the update i

329
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,529
counsel thee service and after i cancel

330
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,509
the service I got a message where my

331
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,249
username God's displayed in the status

332
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,949
bar skype so this that that's the

333
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,209
location where the script code

334
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,999
executions happens at the end but to

335
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,369
exploit this vulnerability you need to

336
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,619
invite another person to this to

337
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,629
describe manager service means for

338
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,489
example if I want to exploit somebody I

339
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,759
need to invite him later but yeah it's

340
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,919
not that difficult to exploit so at the

341
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,049
empty script code execution happens

342
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,179
where the user name gets displayed out

343
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,149
of the context you can see it where what

344
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,649
it takes a look at ednas area have been

345
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,799
removed out of the skype manager ha yes

346
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,959
you use the name been displayed where a

347
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,749
frame get is getting executed out of the

348
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:04,449
main context of the software means um

349
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,970
and my example i included and frame to

350
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,789
any website to show it's possible but I

351
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:12,250
also could include for example and

352
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,750
malicious script code which is getting

353
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,689
executed after you have invited in

354
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,730
person over described manager service

355
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,230
so this is the transfer I'm music this

356
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,910
is the transfer buffer overflow

357
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,210
vulnerability we had a conversation with

358
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,850
my friend and at first it shows me by

359
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,850
transferring the file it displays an

360
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,590
appt fresh for example but this

361
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,480
exception is not being handled because

362
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,590
you could see it's an buffer overflow

363
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,210
inside of the software which really

364
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,910
tricky to exploit because um because of

365
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,950
the specific status you need to exploit

366
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,450
that this are some exceptions we got

367
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,190
into we catch with a debugger which some

368
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,820
some excess violations which happen on

369
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,030
the exploitation this was the

370
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,620
vulnerability verified on Mac OS the

371
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,040
memory corruption which displaying an

372
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,080
error on your mac OS system after

373
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,810
crashing the specific skype service on

374
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,500
it and this is also a memory corruption

375
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,160
the same memory corruption but we took a

376
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,500
lot of pictures so I want to explain and

377
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,900
show how it's really working so um we

378
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,450
also show this picture like you can see

379
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,300
on this picture we try to send one char

380
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,090
to the other person after trying to

381
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,460
exploit the vulnerability this is the

382
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,520
Daniel of service one and on this

383
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,470
exploitation on this session we try to

384
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,890
send the other person one char to to

385
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,260
crash his client after the opening

386
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,180
exploitation so this is the memory

387
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,070
corruption like you can see it's an

388
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,450
unknown error and the input files of

389
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,870
what's oh whoa so and this is in German

390
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,010
so um this is the skype dictionary final

391
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,310
where you could for example search a

392
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,980
specific persons so I try to include a

393
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,260
very large string and so if I'm

394
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,150
including some spaces I get an arrow

395
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,910
which is unknown so I try to exploit

396
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,670
this input field and found out ok they

397
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,460
could some

398
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,500
something passed through so I try to

399
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,270
exploit it and at the end we could

400
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,580
clarify it Daniel service for lineups

401
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:50,399
for mac OS and windows 7 mm this is this

402
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,020
is a court exception and op te of the

403
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,990
memory corruption like you can see here

404
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,330
in the URL it's requesting the skype

405
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,520
dictionary finder and it's including the

406
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,649
string what I have executed out of the

407
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:07,440
input field so the software's get

408
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,990
getting no response by the skype service

409
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,279
and is crashing at result s result yes

410
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,990
this is the memory corruption like you

411
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,779
can see at the end you get an out of out

412
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,049
of memory exception which is very funny

413
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,210
because mostly you you get the display

414
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,159
this message mmm also this the same

415
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:40,590
exception on under the mac OS mmm this

416
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,450
was a picture of a friend of me who's

417
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,090
who has talked to me where this is very

418
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,820
funny story because a good friend of me

419
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,710
has been updated his client and i have

420
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,779
tested it on my real account so i

421
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,270
exploited it out of the box and when i

422
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,460
have included the vulnerability inside

423
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,179
of my specific profile my friends going

424
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,309
online and got redirected to my website

425
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,740
and told me hey man I got exploited by

426
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,299
you so I say whom said him that's not

427
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,940
malicious code I've executed it's just

428
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,340
redirect to my website to show you what

429
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,770
is possible yeah and that's what we

430
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,779
talking about mostly both the

431
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,850
exploitation technics was a which are

432
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,990
different inside of the me a second yep

433
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,779
so um these are the exploitation

434
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,630
techniques we want to present and we

435
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,880
have discovered all the vulnerabilities

436
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,760
to discuss security team so they have

437
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,039
enough time to fix it also the manager

438
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,500
stuff they remove the

439
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,830
tech factor so at the moment the risk of

440
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,690
the vulnerabilities weapon beliefs are

441
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,390
not that explore are not exploitable at

442
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,120
the moment so we should recommend that

443
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,770
because skype once that exactly this

444
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,320
part is very tricky to exploit because

445
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,050
you including from an from an external

446
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,770
service you include external but in bone

447
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,810
service which displaying any status bar

448
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,000
message and so you including it are over

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,820
an update function so the possibility to

450
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,160
exploit this vulnerability is also

451
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,770
working if you have the Facebook mode

452
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,470
inside of your software so after I will

453
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,420
discover the vulnerability somebody's

454
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,520
coming up to skype and uploaded a video

455
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,860
to YouTube where he's exploiting a

456
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,960
Facebook vulnerability by displaying a

457
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
message on its war with scanning

458
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,410
executed all of the context of the

459
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,520
software and it's the same but I

460
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,500
discovered by onion views described

461
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,510
manager service to exploiting the other

462
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,270
person have choosen an externally node

463
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,610
like Facebook which also being displayed

464
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,010
later and you start this fall off the FE

465
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,770
software because you also get a message

466
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,450
you can field on the top that it's

467
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,590
possible to include your Facebook to

468
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,480
include your facebook account where it's

469
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,640
displaying all updates for you ok the

470
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,770
vulnerability which has been released by

471
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,040
Levin Chi on it was very special because

472
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,910
um two or three years ago a person which

473
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,470
called mrs. all from from skype has

474
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,240
talked about vulnerability and skype

475
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,610
security and mostly he said that the

476
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,080
most vulnerabilities instead of the

477
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,680
software our client side so we want to

478
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,920
make clear we have to we have discovered

479
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,500
two server side vulnerabilities inside

480
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,170
of the software which which much more

481
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,540
different to exploit them for example a

482
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,910
client site vulnerability which which

483
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,930
for me not interesting anymore the

484
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,210
vulnerability which has been released by

485
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,559
11am was very easy to it

486
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,899
and it's a big difference between

487
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,690
between my vulnerability of releasing

488
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,269
software and the vampires because the

489
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,960
Empire's runner ability is an internal

490
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,610
vulnerability in the software and my

491
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,499
vulnerability is coming from an inborn

492
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,259
service to the internet service of the

493
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,679
software of the status bar message and

494
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,600
if you know for example an active user

495
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,039
you could hijack you in 10 minutes

496
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,600
because you could see the session cookie

497
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,460
if he's dealing this session cookie on

498
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,100
yo you have not the session had not

499
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,950
expired you could include it to steal

500
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,110
your account of any website for example

501
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,649
and the same the same as on the script

502
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:41,009
code execution out of the software most

503
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:42,600
the most people think this is like

504
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,399
cross-site scripting but if I could

505
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,110
inject JavaScript and stuff like that

506
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,940
it's not any more funny because I

507
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,769
couldn't include malicious stuff which

508
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,869
could be used to exploit you or a

509
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,759
backdoor your software stuff like that

510
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,649
it's very tricky to exploit this one but

511
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:00,419
it's not that high priority like a

512
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,090
preview vulnerability because it's

513
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:10,649
easier to exploit okay you see the

514
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:12,990
vulnerable input fields where lemon

515
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,049
cayenne tried to include his script code

516
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:18,659
which later being executed out of the

517
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:21,389
preview you can see it also he tried he

518
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:24,869
trying different text by by changing his

519
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:27,029
user name change in any input fields

520
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,570
mostly the people which I discovering

521
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:35,159
vulnerabilities are not that tricking

522
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,259
and exploitation because this

523
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,139
vulnerability should be found some time

524
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,230
ago but nobody have checked the input

525
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,539
fields and the active user active

526
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,929
preview user listing so it's very funny

527
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:50,580
that somebody could find it in 10

528
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,529
minutes and people are researching

529
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:55,019
around the software daily or weekly or

530
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,590
monthly to discover something um one

531
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,470
second i want to show also the daniel of

532
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,559
service map which coming from a local

533
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,309
attack to

534
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,390
in a second yes this one too to exploit

535
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,420
this vulnerability it's mostly the

536
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,179
vulnerability is getting exploited by by

537
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,880
a local user means for example if I'm

538
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,500
including a large string on my

539
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,840
notification settings I could be

540
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,120
exploited by other persons which are

541
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,460
remotely connected to two me and a

542
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,550
conversation and this person not should

543
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,450
do not need to to send a large package

544
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,280
or stuff like that after the

545
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,100
exploitation the software's ever asked

546
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,140
in itself is there any word inside which

547
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,360
should multiply this user but if you're

548
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,309
including a very large string and it's

549
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:58,410
every time if you send one shot checking

550
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,440
this one shot if the content of the

551
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,990
large notification notification settings

552
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,550
inside of that the software is

553
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,940
completely crushing this vulnerability

554
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,140
after the local exploitation this

555
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,360
vulnerabilities is exploitable on remote

556
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,790
but it requires to get exploded on a

557
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,100
local system ago and so it's it's no

558
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,550
remote vulnerability its local to remote

559
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,920
exploitable and that's a big difference

560
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,530
because the most people are looking for

561
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,750
Daniel of service vulnerability for

562
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,900
example by sending a large file or

563
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,550
sending large requests or stuff like

564
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,830
that but if you're exploiting it locally

565
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,230
you could explode it later on the remote

566
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,720
way ok let's switch back to the memory

567
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,030
corruption the memory corruption was

568
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,330
located in the skype dictionary finder

569
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,510
when I saw this function I tried to

570
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,330
include a large spring too and the

571
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,250
software from the dictionary finest

572
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,110
getting no response to the software

573
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,510
because of the large request that's why

574
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,040
it's crushing at the end with a memory

575
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,230
corruption this vulnerability was also

576
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,850
been verified on the knee knocks on the

577
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,420
window

578
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,820
and under mac OS so it's a no OS

579
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,890
independent vulnerability also likely

580
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:18,510
boast script code executions when I saw

581
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,850
my own vulnerabilities for example on on

582
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,730
different portals they talked about hot

583
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,710
EML injection but it's completely

584
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,020
because you could also include hakim el

585
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,150
tex and javascript code and that doesn't

586
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,800
mean you just couldn't inject heart a

587
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,690
medal for example like a tech it's

588
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,480
completely crap so don't care about that

589
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,090
now want to explain that again the user

590
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,070
the attacker is connecting to the to

591
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,870
describe manager services counseling the

592
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,480
service and on this point is exploitable

593
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,610
after he is sending the invite to the

594
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,400
user he could execute the script code

595
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,130
out of the out of describe manager

596
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,140
conversation but to exploit this

597
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,090
vulnerability it's required to add a

598
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,220
person to a specific manager account

599
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,010
means if I'm exploiting my local account

600
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,990
setting another user to execute the

601
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,850
script code and adding the third person

602
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,100
through the skype manage ourselves to

603
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,420
exploit it yeah and again the

604
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,330
persistence record execution and the

605
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,800
persistence script code execution of

606
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,100
lemon cayenne and he has included two

607
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,960
stuff in the profile to exploit it and

608
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,020
we have produced a video about to show

609
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,970
you show you all how it's really working

610
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,310
we release their video on for example

611
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,490
goody it was also on hyser it was also

612
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,410
on golem and we also provide some other

613
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,930
videos of exploitation I have recorded

614
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,600
for but I could just just cover three of

615
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,640
these videos after this conference there

616
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,910
are you could download them yeah let's

617
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,880
go back to the client site vulnerability

618
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,170
client-side vulnerabilities mostly

619
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,300
exploitable by saving another person a

620
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,420
link for example and if i send my friend

621
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,540
link which which included in a script

622
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,310
kotak which is not passed by the skype

623
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,490
service the person is seeing for example

624
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,200
of UL which brings you two should

625
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,289
new google but we drag directs you after

626
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,539
clicking on it to another website this

627
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:29,200
vulnerability is very nice but skype is

628
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
mostly searching for more difficult

629
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,289
lunar abilities because this

630
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:37,240
vulnerability czar very easy to put a

631
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,200
patch am so I'm the most vulnerabilities

632
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,700
which has been released in the last

633
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,639
year's our client side that's why we

634
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,769
want to make sure we could also exploit

635
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:54,330
the software on server side yeah

636
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:11,629
and second here and this this hour is

637
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,700
coming from the mac OS system when we

638
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,519
tried to it to exploit the memory

639
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,960
corruption and it's displaying app crash

640
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,700
report on the system which is not being

641
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,519
handled in any way and this

642
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,769
vulnerability is just locally

643
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:30,139
exploitable because of the reason that

644
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:33,739
you're just you are required to request

645
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:36,440
this on a local system because it is not

646
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,960
possible that i'm talking to anybody and

647
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,999
requesting it on a remote where because

648
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,359
it's a local function but it's also

649
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,179
locally exploitable to overwrite mmm

650
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:54,320
address for example yeah and also in

651
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,519
this picture you could see how we

652
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,499
request at the service it's a full of

653
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,839
oil of the coffee service out of old of

654
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,409
the skype order for debugger this is

655
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:05,659
immunity and we try to catch the

656
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:07,909
exception when it's executing the large

657
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,539
thing here it's ending but that's what's

658
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,129
being displayed later in the debugger

659
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:14,929
but we have included a very large

660
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,450
strength to to try to detect the buffer

661
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,409
overflow but i could just explode it as

662
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:24,529
memory corruption at the end because of

663
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:26,239
different reasons it's not it's not an

664
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,159
easy to discover lunar abilities inside

665
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,649
of skype because skype isn't software

666
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,869
which has a lot of protections like anti

667
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,049
debugging staff first process injection

668
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,469
protections and it's very tricky to to

669
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:41,210
Detective owner ability inside that's

670
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,769
why we don't see every week a

671
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:45,320
vulnerability for example on explore

672
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,289
database or CGI or PCP program something

673
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:52,700
like that and that's very funny because

674
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,559
I did it over four months four or five

675
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,570
months I discovered sex vulnerabilities

676
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,460
inside of the software the six

677
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,710
vulnerabilities five are completely

678
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,700
terrified so now this is a strange

679
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,190
statistic because because everybody is

680
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,330
searching inside of this software all

681
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,940
to the NSA is paying people for for back

682
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,580
dooring the software so um I asked

683
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,680
myself why nobody could detect willner

684
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,440
abilities inside when I tried it over

685
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,240
three or four months and detecting over

686
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,740
six burner abilities inside of the

687
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,890
software so if the NSA is paying me some

688
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,600
millions for exploiting the software

689
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,020
okay I'm millionaire from today you know

690
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:43,680
um yeah that's it's very hard to detect

691
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,970
the vulnerabilities inside of the

692
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,310
software that's why we needed this type

693
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,650
security team to verify the specific

694
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,180
vulnerabilities inside because when we

695
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,910
started up a conversation with developer

696
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,850
which named Yuri he helped us to

697
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,910
identify the specific vulnerabilities

698
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,920
inside of the software without his help

699
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,100
it's not that easy to to explode them or

700
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,199
to debug the software because you cannot

701
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,110
do that you just can catch the exception

702
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,150
but you cannot exploit it for example

703
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,179
and in the last week I tried to exploit

704
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,889
the windows my windows system with a

705
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,770
buffer overflow and I try to inject into

706
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,560
the process of skype and when I injected

707
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,260
into the process of skype I got on my

708
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,320
debugger message which which told me you

709
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,150
have to you have detected an integer

710
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,449
overflow inside of this software so when

711
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,250
I saw this message I contacted the

712
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,630
developer and Senate in my material and

713
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,530
at the end we could verify this back as

714
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,800
s not the back was not located in the

715
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,420
skype software it wasn't my locally

716
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,130
system but because of the protection

717
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,020
it's showing me like it's an integer

718
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,270
overflow for example because of dropping

719
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,740
random messages and this was really

720
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,180
tricky because when i saw the debugger

721
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,070
messages on man you have detected a

722
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,050
buffer overflow inside of the software

723
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,690
but at the end we could not verify this

724
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:17,900
issue yeah

725
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,490
yeah this was my presentation about the

726
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,260
sky vulnerabilities if you want to talk

727
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,950
later to me after this presentation we

728
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,260
could talk about it should be no problem

729
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,380
but I'm on a specific base because I

730
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,750
could not could not release any stuff

731
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,990
which is not verified we we want to try

732
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,820
to release some other vulnerabilities

733
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,220
inside of the software but we cannot do

734
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,830
that till the skype security team have

735
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:56,390
verified the issues that's all thanks

736
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,900
you
