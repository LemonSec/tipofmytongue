1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,390
everybody so I guess you have enough

2
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,610
energy for a visa last talk of the day

3
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,480
since we had a lot of interesting talk

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,439
from morning to afternoon so I hope you

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,190
still have some energy for producer

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,100
Michael so we are here to talk about

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,530
social networks and in particularly

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,840
about the privacy of social network so

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,559
is the Big Brother okay

10
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,690
why we are talking over the privacy of

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,390
social network but it's pretty easy I

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,000
mean mainly because social network and

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,010
explain experience a youth surge in

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,050
popularity so the last time I present

15
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,610
something on social network Facebook at

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,310
five million active users when I did the

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,880
slider last week

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,289
the Facebook sites we are claiming to

19
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,420
have more than 800 million active users

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,789
and Facebook actually the second most

21
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,349
visited site so everybody is using

22
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,630
social network and the problem is that

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,610
the amount of personal information that

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,429
are stored there they require for

25
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:30,039
appropriate security production the

26
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,119
problem is that people often the normal

27
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:36,310
user but probably are not computer

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,599
scientists are not aware of available

29
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,229
possibility in which this information at

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,090
astronomy social network and then being

31
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,380
used there and abused by malicious users

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,959
this is why we decide to together with

33
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,880
some colleague of mine to study this

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,149
problem and yeah you have an overview of

35
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,869
the different security attacks against

36
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,940
social networks so just briefly about

37
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,190
myself so actually I'm Italian you can

38
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,610
probably understand by my English but I

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,910
moved to South France where I'm actually

40
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,120
doing my PhD in a research lab and that

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,209
we work on different topics ranging from

42
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,170
malware analysis to web security

43
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,780
to moderate detection and so on and we

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,870
in this last year we just focus on

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,959
social networks because we had a lot of

46
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,540
problems actually that are interesting

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,110
to study okay so the first part of a

48
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,870
toolkit is about a lot I call automated

49
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,459
clearing attacks so this is my first

50
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,480
attacker we're going to analyze and

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,450
somebody is a person via an email

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,410
because this attack is related to the

53
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,989
fact that somebody can actually map your

54
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,700
profile on a social layer in your

55
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,310
private email address okay and usually

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,319
the private email address is considered

57
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,709
a private information so you can D

58
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,150
understand that what is the problem

59
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,230
there so let's start from what is called

60
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,420
the finding foreign functionality so

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,090
different networks such as Facebook

62
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,200
MySpace

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,340
ling-ling offer a possibility to look up

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,090
for an email address in the sense that

65
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,489
we mail address is used there as the key

66
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,730
to see if one of your friend is the

67
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,980
register on these networks okay

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,049
so this is a very useful information

69
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,670
because when you join a network usually

70
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,709
don't have friends so what you want to

71
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,299
do you want to know if some of your

72
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,840
colleagues for example is on the network

73
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,959
so what you can do you can use for

74
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,980
example LinkedIn the functionality that

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,150
allowed to look up people by specifying

76
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,730
their email address so actually there

77
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,820
are two possibilities the first one you

78
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,209
can see there on the left is actually to

79
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:11,819
provide to the networker your

80
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,390
akka email account and your password and

81
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,850
what they never will do the letter will

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,478
a log to your account and we retrieve

83
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,030
your contact list and then from the

84
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,139
contact list they will check if your

85
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,360
your contacts are actually register on

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,400
the social network this is the first

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,729
possibility and almost always such a

88
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,160
letter provide the support for gmail so

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,199
you can give to the net or your gmail

90
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,180
account and you are automatically all

91
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,430
your contacts are important though in

92
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,650
the social network the other possibility

93
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,680
is to specify the email address manually

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,380
or even in the case of Facebook ur to

95
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,020
upload the contact file so you can have

96
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,910
your your email client like Outlook you

97
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,770
can export your list of contacts and

98
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,780
then you can upload a discothèque file

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,270
to Facebook and Facebook will look up

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,020
for for your friends ok so this is a

101
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,240
pretty useful feature but as always the

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
security or as often whenever is a new

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,169
feature problems come along with with it

104
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,460
so yep so let's see if some of you

105
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,919
already understand what is the problem

106
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,990
here okay we have one voluntary

107
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,990
frangipane

108
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,010
yeah that can be a problem but it's not

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,090
the point

110
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,950
I mean in that case yeah you should ask

111
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,960
of the network I mean you just provide

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,670
your credential to the network and you

113
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,870
say okay and therefore retrieve

114
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,060
information for me because I'm lazy and

115
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,590
what I don't want to export at the

116
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,700
contact files of my friends okay so that

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,050
could be a problem you should trust the

118
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,740
network but in any case yeah a lot of

119
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,170
our password store server-side on the

120
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,700
providers phone it's part of a game okay

121
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,790
now a possibility yeah you have a

122
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,940
microphone you polish and other people

123
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,410
have not a person's player theme

124
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,270
analysis product without me knowing it

125
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,210
secure sorry I don't understand you

126
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,850
publish other person's email address

127
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,180
without them knowing it to some sites

128
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,220
exactly this is one yeah this is one

129
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,860
point intentionally that you can map a

130
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,880
list of email address to where profiles

131
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,800
so basically suppose that you have a

132
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,770
list of emails and you want to know to

133
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,350
who this image they belong to so you can

134
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,900
easily query the social network and ask

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,490
a social network to give you all the

136
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,760
profiles this is one one problem the

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,270
second problem is that spammers can

138
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,450
easily validate their email address okay

139
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,650
so suppose that you have 1 million email

140
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,890
address okay that I collect okay somehow

141
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,190
or I generate let's suppose I generate

142
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,340
them around away okay I don't want to

143
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,620
spam all of them probably because most

144
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,300
of them seized and generated randomly

145
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,610
amber are not valid so what I can do I

146
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,830
can use the social network to validate a

147
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,550
visa dress or even I can do target

148
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,380
attack so suppose I have a list of email

149
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,900
address I want only to look up for Rosa

150
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,530
but Italians because I want to spam

151
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,080
an Italian product ok or they want to

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,270
write my ad in Italian okay I want to

153
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,250
spam something in Italian so I can

154
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,169
easily look up for information and

155
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,099
and target only certain type of person

156
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,710
so actually the problem there and

157
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,039
another interesting pieces is that

158
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,979
they're on different networks you're a

159
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,169
possibility for creating thousands of

160
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,409
email address easily in a couple of

161
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,810
seconds like Facebook are not for

162
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,389
example to query up to ten thousand

163
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,449
email address in a single in a single

164
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,929
poster so you can actually validate a

165
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,120
media love my email address easily in a

166
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,000
day with a single machine so we allow

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,880
for example two spammer to just reduce

168
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,229
the number of possible valid email

169
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,279
address another interesting thing what

170
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,870
you can do actually visas are never

171
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,990
experiment with either so what you can

172
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,870
start from some address you can look up

173
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,760
this address and found some and find

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,620
some profiles that match this address

175
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,070
and then Facebook give you the list of

176
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,790
the friends of these people so starting

177
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,110
from video a list of friends that you

178
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,100
can actually father they mail address so

179
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,110
suppose your your friends is called the

180
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,390
fubar you can start buzzing and say okay

181
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,040
maybe is address maybe very something

182
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,839
that is called the food bar at gmail.com

183
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,579
or fubar gmail.com or f bar gmail.com so

184
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,250
you can you can collect the fan from the

185
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,680
friends create an email at least OB

186
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,839
possible email address you create a

187
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,079
social network again you retrieve a mail

188
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,329
address repair valid you get very stupid

189
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,160
friends and when you continue and you

190
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,949
iterate so possibly you can put you're

191
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,260
doing like that and instruct a lot a lot

192
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,310
a lot Allah Allah

193
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,790
a lot of information so the selection

194
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,060
panel what we did we analyzed different

195
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,220
networks that support with finding frame

196
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,760
functionality and among this network you

197
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,920
have internet site that are used for

198
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,139
business like Ling Ling and

199
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,489
single side with are used for meetings

200
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:11,089
or for relation and I can Purdue and

201
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:14,519
MySpace or Friendster and when you have

202
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,379
the famous site like I like Facebook and

203
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:19,799
this you can see this is a big amount of

204
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,919
that I was able to extract her starting

205
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:27,929
from ten thousand million address in a

206
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:31,290
single day okay so we have and you can

207
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,759
see fifty five key K of Valley profile

208
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,549
that I was able to damper on Badu up to

209
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,230
more than five hundred thousand on

210
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,079
Facebook and of course this is

211
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,439
anonymized but each line of this file is

212
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:50,910
made of email address ID okay what is

213
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,509
the ID of the profile in the network

214
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,470
nickname and real name okay so I mean

215
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,720
from a privacy point of view visas are a

216
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,999
key problem the second step was to

217
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,279
correlate them so what's the idea where

218
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,999
the idea is so let's come back here you

219
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,610
see I have a different different

220
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,720
networks so suppose you are register on

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,139
two different networks for example I

222
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,399
don't know you're just are suppose on

223
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,860
Facebook on on LinkedIn using the same

224
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,540
email address let's bingo but I can do I

225
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,429
can actually correlate these two

226
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,949
profiles identities using your email

227
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:37,290
addresses or email address become the

228
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,819
key for correlate to profiles and this

229
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,970
is actually the idea so what we can do

230
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,559
we can correlate the profile among the

231
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,959
different venerable networks and we

232
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,850
convened build an inner each identity so

233
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,579
an identity over we different be

234
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,329
different networks

235
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,639
okay what's the problem well for this

236
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,059
question what's the problem with

237
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,370
matching and correlating profiles with

238
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,680
the same email address on different

239
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
networks

240
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,220
let's see if some security aware user

241
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,259
come up with a possibility but okay

242
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,330
bingo exactly that's the idea so suppose

243
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,860
you are registered on Lindy know with

244
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,900
your professional peripheral information

245
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,200
and then at the same time you go on a

246
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,380
tour of it you use to meet no people

247
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,880
around and you register with your

248
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,089
nickname and maybe you even use

249
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,279
information that are somehow around or

250
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,970
fake so you you can I mean usually you

251
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,700
can say okay nobody will understand who

252
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,890
I am because I register with with a

253
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,020
nickname although this is actually the

254
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,420
case of MySpace often or about the site

255
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,370
letici of Badu for example it is used

256
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,790
for meeting people for find new girl new

257
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,910
man your friends a relation where the

258
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,589
other you can match and you can actually

259
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,000
discover who the people are so what we

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,970
did will be the automated system that

261
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,450
does it easily comfortable so it's I

262
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,940
don't go into detail but yeah it's

263
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,680
pretty straightforward mean everybody

264
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,650
can can do it it's just the matter of

265
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,220
reverse way the protocol HTTP web

266
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,310
protocol used for upload contact list

267
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,339
fetch data and correlate so it's a

268
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,110
matter of scripting basically and we

269
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,530
took sending an email address that we

270
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,180
found on a common link control server

271
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,970
that was taken down by the friend of

272
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,700
mine and that was probably used for spam

273
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,630
purpose so we had a lot of spam email

274
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,610
but we are left on these on these

275
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,480
compromised servers so we just to be a

276
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,330
and we just unique them sorted them so

277
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,280
we had attending an email address and

278
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,370
what we did with we'd look up this ten

279
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,080
million email address over with eight

280
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,610
different social networks so there are

281
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,260
actually two method as I was telling you

282
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,089
before so ever you are provided directly

283
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:46,570
York

284
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,970
Kalista so your list of email all the

285
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,380
other in the other possibility is you

286
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,230
you upload your list to Gmail and when

287
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,060
you say to the network to look up your

288
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,040
account at least from Gmail it's

289
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,010
basically the same one is more fast the

290
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,420
one is faster because you directly

291
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,130
upload your contact list to weight of a

292
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,830
network like in facebook the other one

293
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,750
is the business know where so depending

294
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,120
on the network here you can see that we

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,200
were able to identify the up to Facebook

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,430
10 million email address in the day and

297
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,020
there are left over there a bit slower

298
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,030
like my Spacek where you can only do

299
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,790
five hundred thousand email in a day

300
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,880
this is of course starting from a single

301
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,220
account and the single machine single IP

302
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,470
so you can even iterate and go faster

303
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:42,580
and so we the first aphasia was to look

304
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,910
up this email address find the the

305
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,760
profiles with whom was registered email

306
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,070
address and destruct the information

307
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,660
from this profiles okay some of

308
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,860
information we restructure concern for

309
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,080
example the age of his people their sex

310
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,810
their language their job verification

311
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,540
their correlation status if you are

312
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,530
looking for new people for new in the

313
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,980
sense for doing some friend friendship

314
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,090
relation and the sexual preference so

315
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,250
for example we have hello amenities from

316
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,040
a Seattle and is a single and is English

317
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,410
and this job is tacked on ok and you say

318
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,500
that yes a reasonably income all weather

319
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,010
girl

320
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,670
23 years older female from Paris she is

321
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,770
open to new relations so she's looking

322
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,530
for somebody and she's lesbian and she

323
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,140
also speak English okay and she's a

324
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,730
smoke at all we have a guy which is 25

325
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,880
this is a gay and

326
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,860
is in your tomographic oh so you know

327
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,320
these are just pretty simple example so

328
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,020
let's imagine that we have more than a

329
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,030
million off of this okay so what about

330
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,990
if I grab in the list of LinkedIn

331
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,359
accounts profile for the project manager

332
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,930
at Microsoft what about if I iterate

333
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,270
instead over the security engineer and I

334
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,689
pipe them in a way that I grab for very

335
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:26,819
mail address and then I look up this

336
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,690
email address in my space and I Badou

337
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,280
you know so I can find all the tons of

338
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,360
profiles okay that maybe belong to

339
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,640
anonymous person that I've registered

340
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,130
with the nickname but a bit at the same

341
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,840
time are maybe project manager in

342
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
Microsoft or are security engineers

343
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,120
aware so this is what we did

344
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,210
automatically so we have if you can see

345
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,110
out of a more than 800 profiles

346
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,060
guarana most of em register just on a

347
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,110
network while Verado users that register

348
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,730
on to for you four five six and seven

349
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,170
network at the same time so there are 11

350
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,630
users with average easter on seven of

351
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,540
our eight network at the same time so

352
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,340
they are really addicted probably to

353
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,130
social networking sites because i don't

354
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,440
know how many of our gesture to eight

355
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,620
network or seven networks but even with

356
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,520
the same email address so that's scary

357
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,880
so so doctor let's consider for example

358
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,910
this x this is this is interesting the

359
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,380
sector if we look if we correlate our

360
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,980
profiles and then we beat the beast

361
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,650
identities across different profiles we

362
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,270
can check how many of them actually

363
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,600
pretend to be men on a network and

364
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,390
female on our one

365
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,799
twelve percent of them actually

366
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,900
pretended to be man and female at the

367
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,210
same time then we have of course a

368
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,590
better one out of three lie on the edge

369
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,210
so pretend maybe to be maybes I don't

370
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,530
know he's like 50 years old efficient

371
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,210
your name Dean but then is maybe you

372
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,090
thirty five forty on our networks as

373
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,429
well and the same is with the name you

374
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,030
know a lot of the seventy two percent

375
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,320
actually use different names across

376
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,309
profiles even food many of them actually

377
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:39,059
change 20% of them seventy percent

378
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,549
change the name on the four different

379
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,169
profiles at the same times because we

380
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:46,799
don't want that we can match them we can

381
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,520
hide them and this is actually the work

382
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,240
of for example Human Resources so when

383
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,330
you go into a new in do interviews with

384
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,100
companies they want to find out the most

385
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,590
of you so what imagine what if I would

386
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,140
sell this software through numerous

387
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,720
sources because now you were supposed to

388
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,220
be just to look up or link they know

389
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,320
everybody name dinner pretend to be the

390
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,650
best or with the best career but what

391
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,150
about the tool that automatically

392
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,169
correlate this profile and weaver don't

393
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:24,750
know but facebook when actually you have

394
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,559
another photo of you compromising doing

395
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,390
something so for example we have a

396
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,429
project manager of my team is claiming

397
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,650
to be much younger of ten years on a

398
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,590
dating site a professor or the u.s.

399
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,059
university is registered with a

400
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,980
completely mismatched profile on dating

401
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,620
network and my married manager that is

402
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,860
fifty one is looking for a new woman so

403
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,419
of course we'll have some contamination

404
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,440
from that and one is do not provide

405
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,230
directly a direct map between email and

406
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,270
user so for example you can look up for

407
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,610
email address but then a social leper

408
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,790
won't tell you which of email address

409
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,750
euro kappa belong to who

410
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,299
so you have ten email address you look

411
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,400
up for them and say okay we are ten user

412
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,620
of my network but I cannot I don't tell

413
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,350
you which he made to belong to whom of

414
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,929
course the problem still there because

415
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,640
you can look up each email address

416
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,570
singular 1 / 1 1 / 1 1 / 1 but is much

417
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,809
slower the other solution it's a to

418
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,610
limited amount of queries that you can

419
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,919
do at the same time because not a

420
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,559
reasonably that somebody has more than

421
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,929
10 million emails their needles friends

422
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,280
and you want to look at this 10 million

423
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,220
friends every day when every network at

424
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,220
Embassy is exactly what a social network

425
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,380
as a as a Swami so link till now

426
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,049
restrict your account if you look up for

427
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,900
friends every day because I mean it

428
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,400
makes sense when you look in every

429
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,890
beginner betting on time friends but it

430
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,419
doesn't make sense that you do it every

431
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:07,120
day and the same is with with Facebook

432
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,090
ok fables tell you here they exceed the

433
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,190
limit of uploading count of files so at

434
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,890
least on this side this social network I

435
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,500
contact her they also are pretty rapidly

436
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,700
and they partly fix the problem that's

437
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,030
good I mean from a research point of

438
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,880
view I like when I have feedback and and

439
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,679
I people actually survey the affected

440
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,710
provider also positively and and fix the

441
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,990
problem ok so this is the first part I'm

442
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,450
going probably be too slow because there

443
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,570
are five part it's just the first one so

444
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,649
probably a speed-up

445
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,510
so the subtle one the second one is

446
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,200
about social engineering ok subtle

447
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,940
engineering is the art of manipulating

448
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,700
people into performing action or

449
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,380
divulging confidential information

450
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,960
rather than by breaking in or using

451
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,190
technical cracking

452
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,380
techniques busy from Wikipedia ok here

453
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,929
we talk on various social engineering

454
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,990
attacks why rewards

455
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,309
because the classic social engineer

456
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:22,950
cancer in a classic social engineering

457
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,559
attack the attacker contact directly is

458
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:28,800
victims for simple kevin Mitnick big

459
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,100
telephone call directly with him and

460
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,920
talk to him okay in studying the world

461
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,140
social engineering attack the attacker

462
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,380
feeder is victim with the protects and

463
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,200
then wait wait the better is the victim

464
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,100
to make the initial approach okay what

465
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,040
we want to do this because it's less

466
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,460
suspicious he can bypass current

467
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,600
behavioral and filter based detection

468
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,860
okay for example you can check how many

469
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,540
times you know you you look up for

470
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,980
friends this is a filter based detection

471
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,290
and you can reach million of users of

472
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,050
social network easily okay so why we

473
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,160
have this idea of doing reverse

474
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,490
engineering past the problem came from

475
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,860
the fact that in the experiment we did

476
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,970
before I was using fake facebook account

477
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,660
okay and after I finish of experiment

478
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,530
one day I log in and they saw is this

479
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,580
account at the 26,000 friend request and

480
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,030
say wow how come no I have my personal

481
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,880
account but I never expected 26,000

482
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,650
friend requests so many that if I try to

483
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,300
send the friend request to this account

484
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,850
is or it is usually too many friend

485
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,980
requests you have to process ma'am okay

486
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,010
so we process them easily we have a

487
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,710
script low genome Facebook app process

488
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,580
with friends request start process until

489
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,620
I got too many connection sorry you

490
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,260
cannot create any more connection how

491
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,140
can yeah because I got 5,000 friends

492
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,960
that's the maximum so let's imagine I

493
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,420
have this fake account I use for a new

494
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,370
cap email address and our experiment I

495
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,280
had a lot of friends request I process

496
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
them result like a pipeline I reach the

497
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,640
top of 5,000 friends and when there are

498
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,159
over 21,000 a thirsty

499
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,460
there and this graph on the Left show

500
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,429
you in a year

501
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:41,279
how many fans requested a simple day so

502
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,179
you have about from 8200 friends

503
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,370
requests per day so my question is how

504
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,429
come everybody want to become friend of

505
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,220
this fake profile I mean I did not think

506
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,019
of this fake profile I just look up for

507
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,460
emails so what I did I today I look up

508
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,429
for 10 million email address ok nothing

509
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,119
strange I mean so the problem is that

510
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,490
actually on Facebook is what is how far

511
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,999
the only Facebook at you have this this

512
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:14,970
come later ok in facebook when you look

513
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,279
in on variety you have this box they

514
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,769
tell your age do you know maybe Paul is

515
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,999
friend of you or maybe a Louis friend of

516
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,029
you so this is this pop-up show you

517
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:28,889
possible friends day is there on a

518
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:31,740
little neutral connection for example or

519
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,149
based on the fact that you stand in the

520
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:35,970
same school what she what we discover is

521
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,889
that if you look up for in email address

522
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,710
Facebook things with your friend as how

523
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,450
the booze was showing up of this this a

524
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,210
nice view Allah to all my million of

525
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,539
poor victims you know he was he was

526
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,580
showing up all the time every day this

527
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,409
is a friend of you because she look up

528
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,240
for your email address this is a friend

529
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,830
of you look up for your email address

530
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,360
socially we found a way to exploit this

531
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,200
from the suggestion box of Facebook only

532
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,029
by looking up email address this is

533
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:17,129
still possible so if for example you you

534
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:20,369
like a girl of your so it's enough to

535
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,399
look up for our email address

536
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,480
automatically Facebook will start

537
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,570
suggesting you to her you know even if

538
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,460
you don't know a taller you know maybe

539
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,649
you just got a email address from the

540
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,080
list of students over university so you

541
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,210
look up for email address and you start

542
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,520

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,260
the Ala zone

565
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,700
as your friend so this message is just

566
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,280
proving that soon again various veteran

567
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,750
that you look up for email address and

568
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,059
Facebook suggest you and then this one

569
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:46,790
say so I try to figure out how camera

570
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,920
with no trouble I see you have like

571
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,890
twenty videos friends yes I want to look

572
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,720
through all of them I cannot understand

573
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,920
how come we are friends

574
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,020
hey thanks for your poker would love to

575
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,220
take you out sometimes

576
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,110
let me give me easy me instead

577
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,740
phenomenal

578
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,270
okay so this is what we call a lock on

579
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,490
Monday is the recommendation based

580
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,620
attack so this box here where you have a

581
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,480
actually is not this one but show up

582
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
with your friends is called the

583
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,030
recommendation box

584
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,530
so this is the recommendation base

585
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,100
attack then there is another attack that

586
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,590
is called immigration based and

587
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,660
these awards well in the social network

588
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,730
like but no matter actually done for a

589
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,000
meet serve to make people meet in real

590
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,520
life so big demolition based attack you

591
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,460
just create a profile you say okay

592
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,230
I live in Kuala Lumpur and I'm wrong 25

593
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,210
years old

594
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,860
you stay there and they automatically

595
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,259
people start come to you and who the

596
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:59,059
people from Kuala Lumpur from the region

597
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:01,220
so this is the demographic base attack

598
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,080
okay the other one is that is called the

599
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,999
visitor tracking and it works very well

600
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,549
in LinkedIn for example now in India

601
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:09,529
when you when you log in on variety

602
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:11,210
which is about straining you who has

603
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,179
visit your profile so you can click and

604
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:18,409
you can say our HR from this company or

605
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,360
you can say our security engineer from

606
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,570
this company and so ok usually you are

607
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,460
interested to see our HR from this

608
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,289
companies look my profile may be very

609
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,330
interested so you can click and you can

610
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,850
see its profile as well so this is where

611
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,389
the idea is that you visit as much

612
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:37,700
people as you want which is very easily

613
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,159
is a script so you can visit million of

614
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,659
profiles daily every day every day every

615
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,850
day of a week every week of a mountain

616
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,970
and whether you ate with a babysit your

617
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,769
profile base and you can find requests

618
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:53,480
okay so these are three different

619
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,379
techniques okay I don't go into the

620
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,389
details of a show you we need different

621
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,580
experiments we create different profiles

622
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,970
new man girls yarn all that and we study

623
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,990
how much they are effective and I've

624
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,259
yeah I can point you to some some of our

625
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:15,169
related work that tell you which profile

626
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:16,610
are more effective you can even

627
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,409
understand it by yourself but probably

628
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,840
which profile is the more either the

629
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,960
most effective me number

630
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,370
I want to see a girl saying number one

631
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:38,090
come on is also pretty okay so my idea

632
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,740
here is that basically if you want to

633
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,370
attract you know young people you have

634
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,840
to create a profile of a young person

635
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,190
steady fuel to create a pocket you know

636
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,920
attract the people that are maybe older

637
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,870
they are better hold over the yarn from

638
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,850
from the US so you have to create a

639
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,920
profile in the u.s. if it is hold as

640
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,310
well

641
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,440
so people try to contact people that are

642
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,290
of the same age and the usually in the

643
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,320
same location so you have different

644
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,390
graphics that I skip because we have a

645
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,910
lot of things to say so what we learn is

646
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,220
that here the protector is written port

647
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,620
are critical for visa reversal engineer

648
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,830
attack where you send this protector

649
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,410
that actually break the ice and the

650
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,900
Facebook is a is the Napper way to

651
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,870
provide the strongest protector system

652
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,450
and at the end is also pretty easily to

653
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,960
to exploit there are four this different

654
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,470
contour measure so by the social network

655
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,320
provider should probably verify that

656
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,740
you're strongly verify that you have

657
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,580
some connection before suggesting us

658
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,560
friend so for me is not enough to make

659
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,660
up for an email address and claim that

660
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,760
you are friends so we should maybe check

661
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,830
about you have a certain degrees of

662
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,030
friends in common and whenever our other

663
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,800
solution for example to adopt behavioral

664
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,320
techniques to this such an engineering

665
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,920
or to use capture for incoming friend

666
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,360
requests so you cannot accept these

667
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,780
friends request automatically good

668
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,510
so we shall we go now into chapter 3 and

669
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,350
chapter 3 is a is another technique that

670
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,140
has been proposed by some colleagues of

671
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,500
mine and the idea was to clone the

672
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,560
existing profiles ok so there are

673
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,990
profiles that are very famous that

674
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,840
belongs to famous person and why it's

675
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,300
not that you clone one of this and

676
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,840
everybody want to become your friend

677
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,130
probably and in in facebook you can

678
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,799
easily clone a profile and use the same

679
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,440
name so if I look up for example for my

680
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,000
name on Facebook there are different

681
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,460
people with my name so I can easily

682
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,659
clone an existing profile profile of the

683
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,230
famous at all and stay there and wait

684
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,890
that people become my friend so this is

685
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:12,389
called the occluding attack and so yes

686
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,330
the idea is to clone the information of

687
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,649
a victim okay

688
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,839
and ever you stay there and you with the

689
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,369
people become victim became friend of

690
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:21,839
you all you can even contact them

691
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,070
directly

692
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,489
and you send them friend request and

693
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,510
master victim they are pretty stupid

694
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,330
because even if ever a device friend

695
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,859
invent friends list they don't know

696
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,139
because maybe they have 500 friends so

697
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,239
they still accept my friend request

698
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,369
even if they've already be friend and

699
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,070
they are in their network what you can

700
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,230
do we can even do cloning attack on

701
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,149
different networks so this is pretty

702
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,649
interesting so suppose I I want to clone

703
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:52,679
somebody called the John so I go on

704
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,830
Facebook I go on John profile and

705
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,380
retrieve a list of friends then what I

706
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,480
can do I can go on another network like

707
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,670
a myspace order link Dean what everyone

708
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,430
I can create a profile the call to John

709
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,970
and then I hit start assignee be friend

710
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,700
I check if the list of her is list of

711
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,940
friends is the present also link bit and

712
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,800
then I start find the request to them

713
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,310
and then I create the same profile fake

714
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,020
profile the same group of friends and

715
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,140
then I can start saying the spammer or

716
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,500
what I want then we are what's called

717
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,230
the shield of clothing attacker so let

718
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,859
me say yeah you see you have a somebody

719
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,270
called Danielle and you have somebody

720
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,690
called Katrina even they are two famous

721
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,490
name but we have a same picture picture

722
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,130
of guy how come

723
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,490
so now Facebook has a solution for that

724
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,460
solution if you find in there find out

725
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,650
that there is a profile similar to your

726
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:00,210
so you're surfing you say wow this is

727
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,089
myself how come so actually you can you

728
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:05,820
can send an inquiry tool to Facebook

729
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,770
saying eh this profile is pretending to

730
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,770
be someone else actually is pretending

731
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,480
to be a ver somebody and/or is

732
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
pretending to be a celebrity or is

733
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,990
pretend to be me so you can actually

734
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,060
send to Facebook this this this request

735
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,790
okay so now you have different you've

736
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,560
seen that there are different ways for

737
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,310
collecting easily thousand of friends so

738
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,780
now what we can do we can what we can

739
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,589
exploit the trust okay so suppose that

740
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:41,280
you are an attacker one thing sir is to

741
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,619
send drive-by download links or links to

742
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,500
contain a malicious code by mail to

743
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,990
random people one thing is to send this

744
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,599
one to by mail to people that you have

745
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,510
already validate existing and you know

746
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,970
where they are you know which language

747
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,430
they told another things is to send them

748
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,400
this information over Facebook so you

749
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,380
are friend okay so we do is to leverage

750
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,119
our new friends

751
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,730
refer to a time friend of a lot of

752
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,849
people so again with this fake profile

753
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:21,510
with there's thousands of friends what

754
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,099
we did we did a drive-by download

755
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,810
experiment so I set up an internet site

756
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,109
okay called movie dot I'm radio operator

757
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:34,500
not net and then I just posted this on

758
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,670
the wall and as you can see everybody is

759
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,790
getting get interested no I think there

760
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,650
are many people that don't know what to

761
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,690
do over life so they wait that one

762
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,970
friends for something and they discover

763
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,579
and click and see what happened so if we

764
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,210
click here on this link

765
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,069
this is actually what cannot locate the

766
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:03,020
Internet several proxy no wireless here

767
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,059
pity for you so if you go bad on this

768
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:08,819
site very is maybe you can past and copy

769
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:13,890
very actually a video of a guy is a

770
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,720
funny video of a campaign against the

771
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,990
abuse of alcohol and is pretty funny

772
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,880
so while video is is running okay my

773
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,950
users are they are they're looking at

774
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,720
the video there is a coder on the back

775
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,619
but actually it's pretty easy sometimes

776
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,809
to copy the code I wrote a better test

777
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,630
of a version of your operating system of

778
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,700
your Firefox of the plug-in that are

779
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,400
installed and so on and Thomas met to

780
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,710
send the misinformation to a server of

781
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,940
mine that were very some safety speaker

782
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,839
debt collector so the idea is suppose I

783
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,299
am a malicious user and I just post a

784
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:04,559
link okay to my 5,000 friends how many

785
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:07,049
of them actually need a visit this link

786
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,920
and now many of them use a browser that

787
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,700
I could potentially exploit to infect

788
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,130
their PC here we are so we took we

789
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,670
analyzed actually the plug-in for PDF so

790
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,210
Acrobat Reader Linux flash and then I

791
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,359
got 202 unique access when obese 202

792
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,280
like alpha van has a ver PDF or flesh

793
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,829
that is vulnerable to these critical

794
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:44,309
vulnerabilities via or the mix so this

795
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:45,750
vulnerability are remote code execution

796
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,559
so all of them actually allow execution

797
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,609
on code on the user on the PC of a

798
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:56,130
victim so in this case with this this

799
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,390
means that more than a hundred of them

800
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,160
would have been exploited by my code of

801
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,069
mine so this is the idea receiver idea

802
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,569
is that now attackers are really

803
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:09,190
targeting social networks so they are

804
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,290
it's pretty easy to collect to create a

805
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,119
fake profile or to leverage the system

806
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,490
of a network to create friendship and

807
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,900
when you use a mistrust model to in fact

808
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,190
easy her victim Weber computer this is

809
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:30,520
our bottle eight of the propagate and so

810
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,569
how do you spread an infection okay so

811
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:37,690
one way is to use the classic

812
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,050
clickjacking methods I don't know how

813
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,420
many of you so we can skip it no I tours

814
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:49,290
clickjacking how many know how it works

815
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,710
okay fine okay so I think I have to

816
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,540
explain how it works click Jackie so

817
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,630
killing Jackie is a is a web app hacker

818
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,359
where you have where a transparent

819
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,880
iframe is put on top of the window so

820
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,280
suppose that you have for example on on

821
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,000
Twitter

822
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,420
okay you have a malicious URL okay that

823
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,460
you want to spread it to your to your

824
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,230
victim so what you can do you can put

825
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,170
this they the Twitter button but sure

826
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,460
that where it's written of a sample

827
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,319
share on your friends you put it on a

828
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,800
hidden transparent and then at the same

829
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,680
time you put a window with some content

830
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,040
of it and better using some social

831
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,930
engineering techniques force you to

832
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,750
click somewhere on the on the window

833
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,550
when you click actually instead of

834
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,130
clicking where you actually supposed to

835
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,160
click you click for example on the

836
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,089
button of a Twitter but that allowed to

837
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:00,130
post with this information on your on

838
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,460
your wall so is a technique finally used

839
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,170
to do push of a user on clicking

840
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,630
somewhere where he's not supposed to

841
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,970
click and now we are clickjacking is has

842
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,700
been redesigned with a new name called

843
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,400
the like

844
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,160
Jackie so in Facebook and you have a

845
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,160
visa button that say okay I like as well

846
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,920
this miss content so put the kind of you

847
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,460
okay

848
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,710
suppose a friend of view as a nice video

849
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,869
he puts the V in post a video on either

850
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:35,779
wall okay you know get on Facebook you

851
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:37,970
see their friend of you with the with a

852
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,010
video and you say wow cool I like his

853
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,690
well this video so you click on the like

854
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,089
button when you click on the like button

855
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,819
you will have this video posted on your

856
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,579
wall as well then what happens I think

857
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:51,140
at the friend of you look at the video

858
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,720
is a friend of you say you are wow yeah

859
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,119
this is a cool video I like it I like it

860
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,329
so you click like and get post so where

861
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,250
is that now words are using clickjacking

862
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,880
techniques to force their victim into

863
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,329
clickings clicking this like button in

864
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:15,549
this way the world can propagate over

865
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:19,460
over Facebook easily among linnaeus of

866
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,299
victims now nowadays without for example

867
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:28,460
video that are propagating and using the

868
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,839
using this mystic Nick and so what this

869
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:35,779
warm do very propagate using this like

870
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,299
jacking attack and at the same time they

871
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:42,010
probably embed some drive-by download

872
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,420
JavaScript similar to when I show you

873
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,579
before so they exploit the browser of a

874
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:51,950
different victim and in this way they

875
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,339
propagate for example both okay so this

876
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:58,970
is a vector often used to propagate the

877
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,549
boat and to create this big ball tonight

878
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:07,520
of meals over of users of PC so one

879
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,069
famous example is for example to place

880
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:16,220
so who professor is is a recent botnet

881
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,859
that have been discovered Lovering

882
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:20,900
social networks to propagate

883
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,510
it's pretty interesting because the

884
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,510
method is using to propagate so

885
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,890
basically it was like that you've got

886
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,770
infected somehow by

887
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,320
confess what kuba kuba face desert

888
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,930
usually recovers some some credential

889
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,670
your credential your Facebook credential

890
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,390
from from your computer and it used

891
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,540
whiskershire to log in as you and then

892
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,670
he posted on your wall account a link up

893
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,040
to malicious website for example like

894
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,130
this he links a dad works on his

895
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,980
daughter embarrassing or a lolly this

896
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,450
girl get owned and after a police

897
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,750
officer Reid or a started message which

898
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,210
is how it start to propagate the warmer

899
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,170
then what happens better users click on

900
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,590
this when the user click on visa they

901
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,870
get redirected to a page and this page

902
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,750
automatically exploit the browser and so

903
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,040
compromise the PC so this is one way to

904
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,150
propagate the second way to propagate it

905
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:35,620
is to that could face I mean when again

906
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:40,900
be PC is infected by cool face add to be

907
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,640
Windows XP a lagina system for a

908
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,820
resolving capture in this way use a very

909
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,100
victim to solve the CAPTCHA and the

910
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,290
capture that are solved are used F or

911
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:57,250
creating new Facebook account because

912
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,230
now when you create a Facebook account

913
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,210
you need to resolve the capture so the

914
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,030
question is how can a malware as all the

915
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,150
caps are automatically easily you can

916
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,500
hijack the the window of the victim with

917
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,390
the capture and the victim will with

918
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,000
solve polymer problem so this is an

919
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,580
example of new malware that spread over

920
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,610
social network with with these new

921
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,220
techniques there are thousands of us and

922
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,250
this is why we also discuss office of

923
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,510
its problem okay so we have you have 30

924
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:36,550
minutes left I can show you what what

925
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:39,180
some colleague of mine are doing in

926
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,600
where were we are working so we

927
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,540
developed this this system called safe

928
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,260
book and this is actually a social

929
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,200
network they tried to overcome some of

930
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,690
the problem of existing of existing

931
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,940
network so for example there is cloning

932
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,160
attack where you can convey the entities

933
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,000
of the people kronum identity of famous

934
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,600
authors for example using say book is

935
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,670
not possible because we have the system

936
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,340
based on signing based on yeah one of

937
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,470
identity are assigned by certification

938
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,710
Authority this proves that actually the

939
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,210
people that allergies there are really

940
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,800
really people that are actually real

941
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,390
people are not a fake profiles

942
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,800
okay so let's start on like this if

943
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,810
you're not tired just 5 minutes when I

944
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,830
give it to to question so one idea is

945
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,010
that to use this trusted identification

946
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,610
service to do to prevent possible

947
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,250
cloning attack or possible fake profiles

948
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,440
this one idea the second idea is that

949
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,440
you use a peer-to-peer network where the

950
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,960
different users so everybody using safe

951
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,220
book is actually part is part of this

952
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,570
peer-to-peer network and is various bet

953
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,150
with data instead of being a centralized

954
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,420
to the provider so if you think now all

955
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:19,720
your data are owned by Facebook Facebook

956
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,140
can sell your data to company that that

957
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,010
does publicity for your data they are

958
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,900
and they can use it for publicity

959
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,750
purpose advertisement so your data

960
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,490
belongs to Facebook and the thing very

961
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:35,700
thorough search would say that I

962
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:41,280
remember if yeah I think the price range

963
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,990
in average two and

964
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,970
dollars per mouthful / users for your

965
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,990
data volleyball the valley below of your

966
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,619
data cost are sold by Facebook to

967
00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:02,260
companies for about $100 mouths so well

968
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,540
yeah is okay we have this safe book the

969
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,630
data are not centralized to the provider

970
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,470
but a store they appear so I have

971
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,080
friends but yes that my friends will

972
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,020
hold my data okay this is the first

973
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,430
things the second thing so the other

974
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,500
thing is that there is no big Bravo but

975
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,160
actually can read my dear Tao can sniff

976
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,990
the information like in facebook now you

977
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,140
have this chat system and a lot of

978
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,230
people using to chat with our friends

979
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:38,730
okay nobody prevent us from being

980
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,910
mission from being intercepted and

981
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,110
sniffed so instead in in a safe move a

982
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,730
information are actually between the

983
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,340
different hooks are encrypted and so we

984
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,330
try also to to prevent this Big Brother

985
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,700
attack so I don't go probably into a

986
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,010
design because there may be you can ask

987
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,390
me if you are interested but probably

988
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,910
Vidya is is pretty much this one I was

989
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,119
telling you to to use a peer-to-peer

990
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,510
architecture to store the data your data

991
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,960
to the peers and there is a system that

992
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,930
is similar to the cada header if you

993
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,910
know the cut Zilla Network its kind of

994
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,760
peer-to-peer network and this system

995
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,830
allow you to make your data available

996
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,900
also when you are not online

997
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,640
also when your friends are not online

998
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,380
and identities are actually signed by

999
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,510
certification authority so that they

1000
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,140
cannot be closer ok so I skip this

1001
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,710
profile lookup soubise because otherwise

1002
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,830
you get bored ok I think you get the

1003
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,560
idea of the tool care so it was to show

1004
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,290
you how your

1005
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,970
your Vidya Tibet you store on your

1006
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,070
network can be abused by attackers in

1007
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,550
different way to do we to do it for

1008
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:05,490
example a spam for a validation of

1009
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:09,120
emails to can be used by malware to

1010
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,720
propagate under to infect your PC or can

1011
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,550
be used to both for example my bottle 8

1012
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,890
a to create this big button and of

1013
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,900
infected PC ok great is we are we are 8

1014
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,910
minutes earlier but I think is enough to

1015
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,900
give an idea just a post question if you

1016
