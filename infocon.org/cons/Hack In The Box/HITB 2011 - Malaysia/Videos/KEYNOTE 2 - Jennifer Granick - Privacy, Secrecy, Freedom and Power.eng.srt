1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,090
thank you very much and it's a pleasure

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,730
to be here and an honor to get to come

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,860
to Malaysia and speak with all of you

4
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,690
and get a chance to meet people that I

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,580
have never had the chance to meet and

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,250
talk to before and about these issues

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,100
and what I want to try to do today and

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,239
in this talk is to talk about individual

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,610
privacy talk about government secrecy

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,170
and interplay between technology and the

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,050
law and policy and then sort of pose a

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,809
broader question about what this

13
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,909
community can do to try to improve both

14
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:57,400
individual privacy and also government

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,970
transparency sort of a call to arms in

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,390
some ways so I'm going to start my story

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,110
about 40 years ago because I'm about 40

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,940
and that makes it really easy for me I

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,440
don't have to go back and read any

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,970
history I can just talk about what I

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,850
know and I'm going to talk about the

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,759
ways that technology has changed just in

23
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,060
my lifetime in terms of impacts on on

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,229
privacy and secrecy so I grew up in a

25
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:28,000
small town in New Jersey which is on the

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,030
east coast of the United States and in a

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,219
small town you know I don't know if you

28
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,329
guys live here in Kuala Lumpur I

29
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,890
wouldn't call it a small town but you

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,210
have your neighborhood and the people

31
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,670
who know you and neighbors are sort of

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,350
friendly and people see you walking down

33
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,689
the street but when I grew up if you

34
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,640
were walking down the street nobody saw

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,649
you or even if they did they would just

36
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,960
forget wherever you were sort of people

37
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,579
might be able to tell but that was it

38
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,280
and if you weren't doing anything

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,439
remarkable then for all intents and

40
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,539
purposes there was no necessary

41
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,729
remembrance people forgot it was no big

42
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,700
deal when I made a phone call no

43
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,159
permanent record was made and maybe the

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,749
phone company had some of the numbers i

45
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,729
dialed for billing especially if I was

46
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,920
dialing any long distance numbers and

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
but nobody really kept track of that and

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,170
unless I was under some kind of

49
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,970
suspicion and police officers were

50
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,430
intentionally listening in nobody but

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,170
the other person who i was talking to

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,280
had any

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,440
do it was said the conversation was

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,750
completely transitory and when I hung up

55
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,450
the phone it was basically done when I

56
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,420
sent a letter to somebody if it went

57
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,970
through the mail i sent the letter in an

58
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,220
envelope and when it arrived at the

59
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,530
recipient the person would read it and

60
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,569
they neither throw it out or whatever

61
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,030
and no one none of the mail carriers

62
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,340
nobody at the post office nobody had any

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,950
sense or any idea of what I said in the

64
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,850
letter when I watch TV or listen to the

65
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,070
radio nobody knew what programs i

66
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,320
watched and nobody knew what stations i

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,840
listen to nobody knew what songs i heard

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,870
this completely transitory and totally

69
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,870
unobserved if i borrowed books from the

70
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,940
library the library might keep some

71
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,290
track of what i read but there was

72
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,970
really no records of any books that i

73
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,220
might have picked up or borrowed from a

74
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,530
friend or purchased with cash from a

75
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,940
bookstore or something of that nature

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,269
nobody knew what i read what newspapers

77
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,489
i read what articles i read or for how

78
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,519
long I looked at it everything that I

79
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,860
just said is no longer true today as you

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,579
guys well know now we have video cameras

81
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,040
outside of buildings inside of hotels

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,980
out on the street when I walk down the

83
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,320
street video cameras make a record of

84
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,440
what I'm doing and increasingly with

85
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,510
technology like facial recognition and

86
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,590
other ability to do searches on on video

87
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,440
if somebody wants to look for me a day

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
after a week after a year after

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,549
depending on how long those tapes are

90
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,790
kept they can so no more transitory

91
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,340
walking down the street if I read a book

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,100
on a Kindle or on the web there's a

93
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
record made of what I've read how long

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,850
I've read it how long I looked at each

95
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,640
page what pages I read if I send that

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
book to a friend and my friend reads it

97
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,450
there's a record made of who I sent the

98
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,700
book to of what they read how long they

99
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,400
looked at it cell phones are one of the

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,830
most powerful tools for surveillance

101
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,160
today you carry your cell phone with you

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,500
all the time and it's basically a homing

103
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,960
beacon so when I have my cell phone in

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,670
my pocket for all the time that it

105
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,760
on it's constantly pinging the nearest

106
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,580
cell tower so that the cellular provider

107
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,240
can route the call yet at the same time

108
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,970
those pings either the provider makes a

109
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,460
record or the provider can be asked to

110
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,000
make a record and those pings tell the

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
provider where I ever else has access to

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,700
those records where I am and the

113
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,340
accuracy of that information can be very

114
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,100
granular depending upon how many cell

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,110
towers are in the neighborhood and how

116
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,780
much of the information is collected so

117
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,390
now as we move through the world with

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,390
our cell phones honest there is a track

119
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,790
a record that is made of all of our

120
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,980
movements where we go announcing our

121
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,260
presence to whomever might care to look

122
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,100
at that information um it's also true

123
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,670
that that providers do keep track of

124
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,190
this information particularly for when

125
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,650
calls are being made and those records

126
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,170
providers can keep for they can keep

127
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,430
them for as long as they want but they

128
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,900
tend to keep them for a year or 18

129
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,440
months and records of single tower

130
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,560
connection to a cell tower can be not as

131
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
accurate as if you have multi tower

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,250
connection records but pretty accurate

133
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,860
again depending upon the concentration

134
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,790
of towers in your area and and you know

135
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,010
how how strong the signal strength is

136
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,160
and that sort of thing also with my

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,870
phone it's a communications device i

138
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,270
often use it for texting and or for

139
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,120
email and unlike phone calls texts and

140
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,270
emails make a record potentially

141
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,850
permanent of the contents of all the

142
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,140
communications all the conversations

143
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,600
that i have with whomever i'm texting or

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,320
emailing with unlike mail which was

145
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,020
sealed up in an envelope and was not

146
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,750
accessible to the carrier without some

147
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,400
sort of evidence of tampering and they

148
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,710
weren't that interested in it and those

149
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,010
emails are text searchable they can be

150
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,750
preserved as long as the carrier wants

151
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,870
to preserve them and they are easily

152
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,210
searched today a week from today a year

153
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,360
from today so

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,520
those are just examples of the way the

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,009
technology has changed things so that

156
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:53,740
you have inadvertent disclosures of

157
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,750
things about yourself your movements

158
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,340
your reading habits your communications

159
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,039
who you communicate with of course

160
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,740
there's also the intentional disclosures

161
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,620
that we make every day now mostly in

162
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,969
connection with our use of social

163
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,949
networks whether it be Facebook or

164
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,719
Twitter or whatever it is that you like

165
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,509
to use and when you are communicating

166
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,639
with your friends over these networks

167
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,710
records are being made of all of the

168
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,050
people that you know who you talk to and

169
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,569
what you ate for lunch that day pictures

170
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,229
of your dog or your child or that sort

171
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,110
of thing and we'd like to give this

172
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,639
information that because we like to

173
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,050
communicate with our friends and it's

174
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,330
fun but because we're doing it over the

175
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,240
context of these intermediaries and you

176
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,189
know because those intermediaries the

177
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:40,870
intermediaries have a business interest

178
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,699
in collecting the information so that

179
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:45,340
they can sell ads against it and there's

180
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,310
just a huge amount of data that's

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,779
collected about each of us individually

182
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:53,800
now so compared to when I was a child

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
where you go what you listen to what you

184
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,810
watch who you're friends with all of

185
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,500
that stuff is now searchable observable

186
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,870
collectible obtainable either by

187
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,699
companies or by the government or by

188
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:12,849
whomever yes there is encryption and

189
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,860
there are some technologies which is

190
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,229
unsure people in this room know you can

191
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,270
use to protect your privacy but they

192
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,080
don't work for a lot of these types of

193
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,839
surveillance and you know a lot of

194
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,169
people find themselves not capable of

195
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,300
using these technologies or boy

196
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,250
employing them effectively so on balance

197
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,669
technology has grossly altered the

198
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,070
landscape for individual privacy from

199
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,870
what it was like only 40 years ago the

200
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,760
same has been true for the government's

201
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,430
ability to keep things secret just as

202
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,890
with individual privacy technology has

203
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,810
changed the government's ability to hide

204
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,630
things from the population and i'm going

205
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,430
to use just two

206
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,830
examples and compare an example from

207
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,600
when I was young the Pentagon Papers

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,510
case with an example from from now which

209
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,750
is the WikiLeaks situation so the

210
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,690
Pentagon Papers situation the United

211
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,520
this was in late sixties early seventies

212
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
the United States was fighting of what

213
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,810
Americans call the Vietnam War and what

214
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,870
Vietnamese call the American war and

215
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,630
there was a guy who was a military

216
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,360
analyst working for a big think tank his

217
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,270
name was Daniel Ellsberg and Ellsberg

218
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,470
had access to a large repository of

219
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,320
information and documents that were

220
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
about the conduct of the vietnam war and

221
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,959
military analysts assessment of what was

222
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,580
happening in the war and how well the

223
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,020
united states was doing and all of that

224
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,500
stuff and and these documents that

225
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,720
Ellsberg had access to told a very

226
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
different story about what was happening

227
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,279
in the war then the government was

228
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,370
telling the American people and Ellsberg

229
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,220
decided that he was going to disclose

230
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,620
this information and that's disclosed

231
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,630
the truth behind what was happening in

232
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,760
the conduct of the war so what did

233
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,190
Ellsberg have to do in order to get this

234
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,709
information well the papers were

235
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,980
approximately 7,000 pages of documents

236
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,610
and and what he needed to do was get

237
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,770
access to a photocopier and make

238
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,529
physical copies of these documents on a

239
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,970
copy machine so it was something like 40

240
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,910
or 50 binders full of documents and

241
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,339
Ellsberg and his friend got together and

242
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,870
spent I don't know how long it takes to

243
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,020
make multiple copies of 40 or 47

244
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,230
different 47 binders of documents but

245
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,610
they made these copies somehow smuggled

246
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,920
them out and secret them away and held

247
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,900
on to them for a year or two before

248
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,350
Ellsberg took them to the New York Times

249
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,910
now the New York time what was the New

250
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,079
York Times going to do with these

251
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,010
documents the times is just your typical

252
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,730
newspaper they don't publish 47 volumes

253
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,610
of documents 7,000 pages so what the

254
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,720
time started to do was started to

255
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,189
um write stories about the Vietnam War

256
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,939
based on these documents and there were

257
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,579
a lot of efforts made both by the paint

258
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,319
by the times by other newspapers

259
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:25,089
including the Washington Post and by

260
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,889
people who were in Congress to try to

261
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,319
make sure that the story got out so

262
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,050
Ellsberg gave some of these documents to

263
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,259
a senator a congressman and the

264
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,069
congressman entered about half of the

265
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:41,110
pages of the documents into the

266
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,290
Congressional Record and he did this he

267
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,920
trying to use the law a law about the

268
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,199
Free Speech and Debate clause in the

269
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,480
United States Constitution because he

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,790
thought that once the documents were

271
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,319
entered into the Congressional Record

272
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,120
there would be no way that the

273
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,129
administration could Ben Commons and

274
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:01,750
suppress them because there was a

275
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,970
congruent there was a constitutional

276
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,439
provision which he could argue would

277
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:08,139
prevent removing those documents from

278
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,720
the public record so the newspaper was

279
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,550
trying to publish stories about it the

280
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,139
congressman was putting as many

281
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,759
documents as he could bid into the

282
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,279
Congressional Record the Washington Post

283
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,500
started publishing stories about it as

284
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,620
well and the administration which was

285
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,059
the Nixon administration at the time had

286
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,250
a pretty quick response they asked for

287
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,500
The Times to voluntarily cease public

288
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,420
publishing stories about the documents

289
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,509
and they got an injunction which is a

290
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,519
court order from a judge saying that the

291
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,990
paper could no longer published those

292
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,360
stories other newspapers including the

293
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,829
Washington Post started to publish

294
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,329
stories based on the same set of

295
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,660
documents and in very short order

296
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,329
because it was a case that involves free

297
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,519
speech and an injunction on newspapers

298
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,470
the case went up to the United States

299
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,600
Supreme Court which is our highest court

300
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,079
and the court issued a ruling about

301
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,750
whether there could be a prior restraint

302
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,470
on speech so just for those of you who

303
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,990
are interested in speech policy and the

304
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,920
law of speech in the legal terms prior

305
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,750
restraint is something where they

306
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,130
prevent you from talking ahead of time

307
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,640
and what the court said in a complicated

308
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,910
legal opinion with many different many

309
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,260
different opinions written by different

310
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,120
judges basically the gist of the case

311
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,610
was that under United States law and the

312
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,660
First Amendment of the United States

313
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,060
Constitution you have to make an

314
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,070
extremely high showing in order to

315
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,220
justify a prior restraint and really you

316
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,180
know if you're looking at the situation

317
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,100
with the Pentagon Papers and the

318
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,750
argument that the Nixon administration

319
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,880
said which was that this would undermine

320
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,920
the United States conduct of a war

321
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,500
during wartime the court said their

322
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,380
justification was not enough so you know

323
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,540
essentially for all intents and purposes

324
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,000
if that Pentagon Papers cases filed as

325
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,910
followed there isn't hardly anything

326
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,360
really that could legitimately justify a

327
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,460
prior restraint on speech under United

328
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,580
States law that doesn't mean just to

329
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,820
clarify did you know sort of what that

330
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,920
what that's about that doesn't mean that

331
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,800
speakers can't be punished after the

332
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,170
fact whether newspapers or otherwise

333
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,330
that doesn't mean that if you do go and

334
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,220
publish the stories you can't that the

335
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,710
new paper can't get in trouble for any

336
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,720
of a number of different kinds of claims

337
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,520
afterwards whether it be copyright

338
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,190
infringement or possession of stolen

339
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,710
documents or disclosure of trade secrets

340
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,050
or something like that it basically just

341
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,520
means that you can't stop the

342
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,840
publication ahead of time the

343
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,880
information is going to get out and then

344
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,530
let the chips fall where they may

345
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,630
afterwards depending upon how you know

346
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,060
what happened there so it's not a

347
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,040
get-out-of-jail-free card for the press

348
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,380
but it is a ruling that says speech goes

349
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,150
forward first okay so what it Ellsberg

350
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,470
and some have to do to get this

351
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,960
information out there he needed a copier

352
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,270
he needed a hell of a lot of time he

353
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,610
needed a truck to carry the boxes of

354
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,940
documents around he needed a newspaper

355
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,100
that was willing to put its neck on the

356
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,170
line and do the publication and The

357
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,320
Times had gotten some advice from you

358
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,000
know beforehand before they did the

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,860
publication that maybe they shouldn't so

360
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,330
they needed a paper that was willing to

361
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,240
put the data out there and then

362
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,070
you know a whole heck of a lot of

363
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,790
lawyers after the fact okay let's

364
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,820
compare the situation with WikiLeaks in

365
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,670
WikiLeaks the recent case involving a

366
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,060
American diplomatic cables and Bradley

367
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,370
Manning bradley manning was a young guy

368
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,420
in the army he because of where he was

369
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,600
stationed had access to the switch

370
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,390
through which confidential data was sent

371
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,270
by the United States military and from

372
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,770
his access to the Swiss she basically

373
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,709
just downloaded which something which i

374
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:59,390
think is the equivalent of a quarter of

375
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,820
a million diplomatic cables from the

376
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,250
United States downloaded them put them

377
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,070
on a CD or a thumb drive went to the

378
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,050
United States on vacation or when he was

379
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,709
on shore leave and gave that information

380
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,830
to basically give that information to

381
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:20,000
the WikiLeaks site and WikiLeaks is able

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,459
to publish that data in full on the web

383
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,290
without any kind of like they are is

384
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,060
editorializing but it's not necessary

385
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,760
and now we can go online and look at

386
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,950
that repository of cables and we can

387
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,350
read it we can search it we can you know

388
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,790
we can do text searches we can look at

389
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,209
it and we can read them for ourselves so

390
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,839
I mean think about the difference

391
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,470
Ellsberg was a really high up guy in the

392
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,079
analyst community Bradley Manning was a

393
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,980
23 year old soldier in the army Ellsberg

394
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,209
had to have access to a copier that he

395
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,149
could use in private Manning just hooked

396
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,609
into the confidential into the switch

397
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,199
through which classified information was

398
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,010
sent Ellsberg needed to have a whole lot

399
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,709
of paper and a truck in a bunch of boxes

400
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,099
and a bunch of binders Bradley Manning

401
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,400
needed a thumb drive or a CD Ellsberg

402
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,349
needed a newspaper that was going to

403
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,300
stick its neck out and publish the

404
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,859
documents and the newspaper had to have

405
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,599
a reporter who is going to read through

406
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,309
the documents and come up with a story

407
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,410
and publish stories based on the

408
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,870
documents Manning could give the

409
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,779
documents to Assange or find a server

410
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,200
and put every single one up in full and

411
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,369
full-text searchable this could not have

412
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,440
happened back in nineteen sixty-nine

413
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,700
when Ellsberg was acting now because of

414
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,109
the internet and because of digital

415
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,330
technology we can have access to

416
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,669
terabytes of data full-text searchable

417
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,219
completely publishable with little to no

418
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:01,159
easy to easy to copy easy to transmit

419
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:03,649
easy to read easy to search with little

420
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:11,119
or no cost so what a you know and just

421
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,009
sort of just some commentary on what

422
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,479
this means and what the WikiLeaks

423
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,979
situation shows about the way that

424
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,149
things have changed for government

425
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:19,999
secrecy is and this is a quote from

426
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,399
Steven Aftergood who's at the project on

427
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,109
government secrecy at the Federation of

428
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,080
American scientists he said this example

429
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,450
the example of WikiLeaks illustrates the

430
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,729
extraordinary asymmetric power that a

431
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,159
leaker can have especially when aided by

432
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,469
an outfit like WikiLeaks but of course

433
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:41,869
not necessarily okay so I don't mean

434
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,239
necessarily in what I'm saying here to

435
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,009
be taking sides and to say that things

436
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:48,049
were better in the Pentagon Papers day

437
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,239
or better in the wikileaks day what I

438
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,739
mean to say is that because of

439
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:55,129
Technology certain constraints on both

440
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,139
privacy and government secrecy have been

441
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,089
dissolved and so now we are in a

442
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,279
completely different world where things

443
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,839
are not like they were just a short time

444
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,539
ago and let me give you some other

445
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,549
examples about how technology has posed

446
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,259
the similar kind of challenge to

447
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:16,129
corporate secrecy okay so um I talked a

448
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:19,580
little bit before about handset your

449
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,409
handset and how it shows your location

450
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:23,690
so one of the things that we thought

451
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,909
about a lot when I was at the Electronic

452
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,239
Frontier Foundation is government access

453
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,909
to that handset location data and

454
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,979
through you know through the provider

455
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,799
and one of the things that we don't know

456
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,460
is how often government's go and collect

457
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,219
that data and use it to figure out where

458
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:45,410
people are we're very interested

459
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,210
how in you know how often that happens

460
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,280
in what's done so um there was a guy who

461
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,350
is a security researcher and a doctoral

462
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,760
student at the University of Indiana

463
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,360
named chris nguyen and sagu ian was

464
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,330
hired by the Federal Trade Commission

465
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,490
which is a in the United States

466
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,980
government to do privacy and security

467
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,580
research as like a you know for them

468
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,780
basically to deal with issues involving

469
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,330
spam spyware and those sorts of things

470
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,340
they recognize that they needed somebody

471
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,870
with a technical background and they

472
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,290
picked Chris and Chris had gained some

473
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,090
notoriety when he was still a student

474
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,860
and by basically a sort of interesting

475
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,170
prank that I represented him following

476
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,410
he did that you know you guys fly so you

477
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,770
know that you need a boarding pass and

478
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,180
they check your boarding pass on your ID

479
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,160
when you come into the airport and so

480
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,860
people had said that the boarding passes

481
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,270
when you can print them electronically

482
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,520
on the computer are editable and so it's

483
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,250
not a legit it's not a real legitimate

484
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,440
evidence that you have a ticket and that

485
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,210
you're going to fly that day so using it

486
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,770
as a security measure is kind of dumb

487
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,520
and a number of people had said that but

488
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
nobody really paid much attention to it

489
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,700
so while he was a graduate student with

490
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,860
Chris did is he sped up on his webpage a

491
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,770
automatic boarding pass generator which

492
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,840
gave you basically a you know template

493
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,790
of a boarding pass and allowed people to

494
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,040
just type in whatever their name was and

495
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,210
then you could print the boarding pass

496
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,490
out being like a sort of actual

497
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,560
demonstration of the principle that

498
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,910
everybody knew which is that the

499
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,860
boarding passes not evidence of anything

500
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,020
anybody can just can just create it and

501
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,270
he put it up on his website and there

502
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,090
was a lot of outcry in fact some members

503
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,620
of the United States Congress called for

504
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,620
Chris to be prosecuted for you know for

505
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,080
this prank but it did call attention to

506
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,430
the problem we don't think anything

507
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,820
ended up changing and Chris was

508
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,960
investigated by the Transportation

509
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,260
Safety Agency as a result of this and I

510
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,580
represented him in that in that

511
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,190
investigation and he ended up nothing

512
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,960
happened to him but this gives you a

513
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,670
little bit of an idea of you know where

514
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,140
Chris was at and the kind of person that

515
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,700
he is and so here he was at the FTC

516
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,230
and as part of his FTC job he got

517
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,659
invited to a conference in Washington DC

518
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,940
which is the intelligent support systems

519
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,049
conference or ISS and ISS is the yearly

520
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:12,490
conference they do it all around the

521
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,919
world not just in DC for criminal

522
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,169
investigations intelligence gathering

523
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,480
and lawful intercept lawful intercept is

524
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,100
what is what the government calls

525
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,320
surveillance technology so the

526
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,240
conference is invite only and press got

527
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,490
invited because he was a working at this

528
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,340
government agency and so he signed up

529
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,529
for the conference and his employers

530
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:34,539
knew that he was going and you needed to

531
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,620
show proof that you were government

532
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,659
employee so he showed his FTC

533
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,340
identification badge and he got into the

534
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,880
conference and he went to a session that

535
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,070
was about location tracking via cell

536
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,980
phone handsets and at that session there

537
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,049
was an employee from sprint which is a

538
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,539
major carrier and the Sprint employee

539
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,970
told the audience an audience of about

540
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,299
50 people that sprint had set up an

541
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,490
automated website that law enforcement

542
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,169
could use to get location data about

543
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:08,500
sprint customers and that in the 13

544
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,690
months that the sprint website had been

545
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,309
set up there had been eight million

546
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:16,679
pings for that kind of customer data so

547
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,059
there's some debate about what a pain

548
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,710
means whether that it's not eight

549
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,380
million people and how often a ping is

550
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,610
like you're tracking somebody its

551
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,559
location in real time how many things

552
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,299
you need in order to track them over how

553
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,760
much of a period of time but this was

554
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,690
really news for people because nobody

555
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,260
had any other kind of data about how

556
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,870
often law enforcement accesses cell

557
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,649
phone data for location tracking Chris

558
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,350
made a tape recording of the session so

559
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,360
he had the Sprint guy on tape and after

560
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,570
the conference was over he wrote on his

561
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,039
blog that this is what the Sprint guy

562
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,929
said and he posted the audio lest

563
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,580
anybody say that's you know that's not

564
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,500
what the Sprint guy had said and there

565
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,039
was a big hue and cry over it and then

566
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,410
sprint and

567
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,930
you know sort of scrambled to to qualify

568
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,910
the 8 million number and to sort of

569
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,410
raise questions about what that really

570
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,480
meant in terms of tracking and that sort

571
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,160
of thing well I think you know a lot of

572
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,870
people were kind of a ghast that there

573
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,730
were eight million pings just from

574
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,230
sprint just in the 13-month period you

575
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,300
know there was a lot it raised a lot of

576
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,730
awareness about the ubiquity of the

577
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,430
practice just with even this one carrier

578
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,800
just over this period of time and the

579
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,770
fact that the access was automated

580
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,230
meaning that there wasn't any kind of

581
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,880
check and balance going on by the

582
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,560
company where the company was making

583
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,570
sure that what the law enforcement

584
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,220
agents were doing was either authorized

585
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,710
by court order or somehow justified by

586
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,420
the investigation that what they were

587
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,080
doing or something like that so what

588
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,900
happened after that was Chris got fired

589
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,290
from his job at FTC now for making the

590
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,180
recording that was legal not for

591
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,860
disclosing the information that was free

592
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,580
speech he got fired allegedly because he

593
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,730
used his FTC badge to get into the

594
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,190
conference as ID to get into the

595
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,570
conference even though he was invited

596
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,980
even though his employer knew that he

597
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,500
was going so he lost his job there after

598
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,580
just a year of being at the FTC another

599
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,250
example of corporate privacy is a

600
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,700
another case that I worked on involving

601
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,960
electronic voting machines and this was

602
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
a company called diebold which makes

603
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,620
electronic voting machines that people

604
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,980
can evoke and in this case somebody

605
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,710
unknown person got hold of an archive of

606
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,940
internal emails that the company's

607
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,170
technicians had about their efforts to

608
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,940
deploy these electronic voting machines

609
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,140
out in the field and the emails the

610
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,480
email repositories showed some

611
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,610
unbelievable and it would be funny if it

612
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,710
didn't have to do with like the very you

613
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,390
know essence of democracy which is

614
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,060
voting some very shocking problems with

615
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,460
these voting machines including coming

616
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,530
up with negative tallies like how could

617
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,780
algor get negative twelve hundred votes

618
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,280
in a particular district and the people

619
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,180
who got hold of

620
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,010
these emails leaked them and then

621
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,380
multiple groups including some anti-war

622
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,440
groups and some anti electronic voting

623
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,720
groups published the repository of

624
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,670
emails online and people could search

625
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,260
through the emails you could find your

626
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,450
district if you knew your district

627
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,860
number and see whether there had been

628
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,420
any problems for the voting machines

629
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,790
reported in your particular district so

630
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,860
how did diebold respond to this did they

631
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,840
fix the voting machines did they

632
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,390
apologize did they explain the situation

633
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,490
now they issued cease and desist letters

634
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,160
threatening the people who had posted

635
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,170
these repositories of emails with

636
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,690
copyright infringement claiming that the

637
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,100
emails their employees wrote we're

638
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,460
copyright infringing and therefore you

639
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,690
know they had people had to take them

640
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,940
down or risk liability under copyright

641
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,960
law so what the eff did and when I was

642
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,390
at Stanford I worked on this case to was

643
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,380
to turn around and Sue diebold and say

644
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,120
that the copyright claim was unbasic

645
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,000
alee didn't have a basis in law and that

646
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,920
the reason why diebold was doing this

647
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,140
was to suppress information about the

648
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,480
quality of their voting machine product

649
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,320
and that was not a legitimate copyright

650
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,220
reason to issue takedowns and we won

651
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,950
that case and got a first-ever ruling

652
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,460
that said that you know you can't use

653
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,620
provisions of United States law that

654
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,000
provide for notice and takedown for

655
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,950
copyright infringement in order to

656
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,590
suppress speech like this and where

657
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,900
there's no real copyright interest

658
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,490
that's at stake it's just a speech

659
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,490
suppressing interest so excuse me I'm

660
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,840
gonna look at what how much time I have

661
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,480
left so you'll see because i'm going to

662
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,520
tell a few more stories about this that

663
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,820
copyright law is a great tool for people

664
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,840
who want to suppress speech super useful

665
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,680
so um let me give another example so my

666
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,630
other example is a case that I you know

667
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,640
we talked about in my one in my

668
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,170
introduction about some of the the

669
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,750
computer hackers that I've represented

670
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,720
in 2005 at the black hat conference I

671
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,970
represented a guy

672
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,470
Michael Lin and this is another example

673
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,230
of how copyright law was used to try to

674
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,540
suppress information coming out about a

675
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,090
company and accompanies faulty products

676
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,840
so does anybody here know the the story

677
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,350
with Mike a few people you guys do so um

678
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,130
sorry so basically I did you know this

679
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,860
is another example of how difficult it

680
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,380
is for companies to suppress information

681
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,890
about about their products and also a

682
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,230
story about how using the law to try to

683
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,610
suppress that information sometimes

684
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,240
works and sometimes doesn't so Michael

685
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,860
worked for a company called ISS

686
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,480
different ISS from the surveillance

687
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,050
conference and as part of his job there

688
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,320
he was working on the security of cisco

689
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,050
routers basic technology that runs the

690
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,030
internet and he discovered

691
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,890
vulnerabilities and the routers which

692
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,290
were previously unknown and potentially

693
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:24,890
very serious Cisco which worked with his

694
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,800
company put pressure on his employer to

695
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,260
have Mike pull the talk that had been

696
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,210
accepted at the black hat conference and

697
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,660
the employer agreed and told Michael

698
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,790
that he couldn't give the talk and told

699
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,930
him he had to give a talk about

700
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,970
something else so Mike got up on the

701
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,910
stage quit his job and gave the original

702
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,130
talk that he had planned to give about

703
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,420
the cisco routers from the very

704
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,780
beginning and it was a you know it was

705
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,270
very exciting until just a few hours

706
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,270
later when he got a lawsuit served on

707
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,480
him a lawsuit filed by both cisco and by

708
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,000
his employer claiming that he was liable

709
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,870
for copyright infringement so um the

710
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,230
copyright case was based on the idea

711
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,740
that Mike's employer owned copyright in

712
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,960
the PowerPoint slides that he had used

713
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,940
during his talk and and that Cisco owned

714
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,450
copyright in the D compiled code that

715
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,880
Mike had used to do the research that he

716
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,280
had done there was also a trade secret

717
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,430
claim where Cisco claims that the fact

718
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,220
that the routers were insecure was a

719
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,440
trade secret and by disclosing that

720
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,940
trade secret my

721
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,210
violated the trade secret law so again

722
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,129
in this case we see the talk had already

723
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,929
happened and but now we have this

724
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:48,830
lawsuit and we were in this sort of

725
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,049
marathon session the whole rest of that

726
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,240
weekend trying to dispose dispose of the

727
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,870
lawsuit and you know clear you know one

728
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,279
of the things about trade secret law is

729
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,450
that trade secrets are protected if they

730
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,840
are something that the company derives

731
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,029
value from the fact that the thing is

732
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,490
secret and so we had basically two

733
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,080
interesting arguments about that the

734
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,509
first one was the fact that your product

735
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:17,500
doesn't work if people don't know that

736
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,750
yeah the products more valuable but

737
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,730
that's not the kind of secret the trade

738
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,950
secret laws meant to protect you know

739
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,330
the knowledge that the product actually

740
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,690
sucks and then the second thing was that

741
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,610
you know when you were do reverse

742
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,620
engineering and you find out from a

743
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,940
product that's just you know generally

744
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,679
on the market when you do that research

745
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:37,820
and you find out that the product

746
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,830
doesn't work and that's not a

747
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,950
misappropriation it's a legitimate

748
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,330
discovery of that information and the

749
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,830
trade secret law doesn't control or

750
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,539
regulate legitimate discoveries of that

751
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,090
nature so what ended up happening in

752
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,710
that case was we were able to settle the

753
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,750
lawsuit after a couple of days it was

754
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,379
pretty stressful but subsequently Cisco

755
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:00,559
had an ISS and his employer got the FBI

756
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,330
involved which is the federal law

757
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,889
enforcement agency for the United States

758
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:06,200
and the FBI investigated Mike for a

759
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,059
couple of months thereafter before

760
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,139
eventually closing the investigation

761
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,480
without any further action so it's

762
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,000
pretty stressful but as a result we know

763
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,559
a lot more about routers and router

764
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,149
security and there was a lot of great

765
00:32:17,149 --> 00:32:18,470
research that built on the stuff that

766
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,000
Mike had done you know at other

767
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,649
conferences later that year and the next

768
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,929
year and you know route we know them a

769
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,429
lot more about how to make router secure

770
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:29,570
now than we did so you can kind of start

771
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,269
to see here the problem of how the law

772
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:35,960
is being asked to come in and protect

773
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,250
the secrecy of things that now people

774
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,860
are able to discover and disclose so you

775
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,450
know with Mike the slides were out

776
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,180
people pass them around Cisco and ISS

777
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,950
not control the power point slides once

778
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,600
they were published they were just you

779
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,840
know I out on the internet so you know

780
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,640
we there's been a number of cases that

781
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,720
I've been involved in where you know

782
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,180
there's been efforts on both sides to

783
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,670
try to with using the law to try to

784
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,920
protect individual privacy or protect

785
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,630
government secrecy or protect corporate

786
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,360
secrecy and the law is you know sort of

787
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,610
a it's a little bit of a mess so I'll

788
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,110
give just a couple examples in the

789
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,200
privacy world and when I was at eff we

790
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,410
did a lot of work on location privacy

791
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,040
and cell phones and I mean I'm not going

792
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,890
to get into the legal details of what

793
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,420
that looks like because it's not

794
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,400
relevant for a lot of people here but

795
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,140
what I'll say it just sort of generally

796
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,860
is there's a statute that Congress

797
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,860
passed in 1986 called the Electronic

798
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,190
Communications Privacy Act and all of

799
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,380
the stuff that we try to protect in

800
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,940
terms of your individual privacy your

801
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,950
emails or text messages your physical

802
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,320
location all of that stuff we have to

803
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,000
look to this statute that was passed in

804
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,490
1986 and try to argue that there's some

805
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,050
kind of protection under there and

806
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,840
because if that doesn't work then all we

807
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,790
have in the United States to fall back

808
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,120
on is the fourth amendment for the

809
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,080
Constitution Fourth Amendment only

810
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,270
applies to law enforcement actors and

811
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,850
only for a certain set of things that

812
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,980
are the type of things that individuals

813
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,400
might want to keep private so um you

814
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,949
know in terms of cell phone data and

815
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:21,830
real-time pings and the ability of law

816
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,050
enforcement to get access to that we

817
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,380
have you know 25 page briefs arguing

818
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,710
that this complicated interplay between

819
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,330
various sections of the Electronic

820
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,560
Communications Privacy Act as amended by

821
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,330
you know another law mean that

822
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,699
government can't track you in real time

823
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,110
without first going to get a warrant and

824
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,460
just a little bit about you know what

825
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,170
that means there's a number of ways

826
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,790
obviously that law enforcement can go

827
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,620
and get your information one is they

828
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,150
could just ask the company for it and

829
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,949
the company can just voluntarily turn it

830
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,480
over they could also just go to the

831
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,410
company and take

832
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,970
information if they want they could

833
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,070
subpoena in other words issue a court

834
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,720
order to you and ask you for the

835
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,400
information and at that point you know

836
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,050
that you're being investigated and you

837
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,760
could go to a court and ask the court to

838
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,470
say the subpoenas inappropriate for some

839
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,390
reason or they can we can interpose the

840
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,300
a judge as kind of a gatekeeper there

841
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,400
between law enforcement in the comp and

842
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,460
the data and ask the courts to sort of

843
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,620
police that relationship and when the

844
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,260
courts police that relationship

845
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,280
basically you know there's a lot of

846
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,770
different standards you can ask the

847
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,720
court to have to find before they issue

848
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,550
an order saying it's okay for law

849
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,170
enforcement to get access to this data

850
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,110
so there's lesser standards where it's

851
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,060
like there's a you know it's relevant to

852
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,250
an investigation there's that you know

853
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,830
all the way up to probable cause which

854
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,530
is that you know you it's probable that

855
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,300
the information is going to show

856
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,140
evidence of a crime and when we aunt

857
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,700
when we talk when I talk about a warrant

858
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,230
under United States law that's the

859
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,060
probable cause standard where a judge

860
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,250
looks at the fact that a law enforcement

861
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,370
officer presents to her and says I see

862
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,690
here that there's a real investigation

863
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,850
going on that the stuff they're looking

864
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,440
for is legitimate part of this best

865
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,290
investigation the facts show to me that

866
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,630
it's probable that if we give over this

867
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,060
information it's going to be evidence of

868
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,290
the wrongdoing that they're

869
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,390
investigating as opposed to sort of a

870
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,180
hunch or kind of like a an inkling or

871
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,740
just sort of like some looking looking

872
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,140
around or that kind of thing so in order

873
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,210
to have it be some kind of privacy

874
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,530
protection where they're doing this kind

875
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,720
of you know not in your presence seizure

876
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,240
of information or going to to the

877
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,090
provider we want the court to play some

878
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,550
kind of gatekeeper role otherwise it can

879
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,250
just be a total fishing expedition so we

880
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,310
were able to use these complicated

881
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,140
statutory argument to argue that they

882
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,210
need a warrant for and real-time

883
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,550
following you with your cell phone just

884
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,870
you know sort of with their automated

885
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,500
sprint website and we've used the same

886
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,660
you know sort of another set of

887
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,210
complicated arguments to argue that for

888
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,040
historical data in other words the data

889
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,900
that the provider stores in order to do

890
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,720
your billing that if the court wants to

891
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,860
because we didn't have an argument but

892
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,110
they have to but if the court wants to

893
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,420
then the court again can ask for a

894
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,950
warrant and what the government had

895
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,570
argued is the court has no right to ask

896
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,190
us for a warrant they have no right to

897
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,020
ask us for any proof all we have to do

898
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,600
to the court has just tell them you know

899
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,430
this information is relevant to an

900
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,650
investigation that we're conducting

901
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,590
conducting so why are these statutory

902
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,110
arguments that we made so important and

903
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,630
why did we try so hard to interpose this

904
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,870
kind of statutory limitation for to

905
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,790
protect the privacy of people as they

906
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,490
move through their lives well it's

907
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,070
because the Fourth Amendment doesn't do

908
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,320
that work really and the Fourth

909
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,280
Amendment to the United States

910
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,970
Constitution says that if you have a

911
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,490
reasonable expectation of privacy in

912
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,460
something as a general rule in order to

913
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,660
invade that expectation of privacy

914
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,070
government needs to go get a warrant

915
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,650
there's tons of exceptions to that rule

916
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,780
but that's kind of the general rule so

917
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,700
think about your location as you move

918
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,260
through the world do you have a

919
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,300
reasonable expectation of privacy in

920
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,740
your movements and um who thinks you do

921
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,210
have a reasonable expectation of privacy

922
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,070
in your movements as you walk around on

923
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:23,330
the public street it's nobody okay well

924
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,650
you guys are going to get you guys are

925
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,910
going to get you guys have a lot of

926
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,680
Supreme Court justices we're going to

927
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,280
agree with you and in the 1970s there

928
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,830
were some cases about this that involved

929
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,380
beepers and just a little beeper that

930
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,350
you stick on the bumper of a suspects

931
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,930
car and it's kind of like a you did you

932
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,160
ever play that game like you're getting

933
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,230
colder you're getting hotter sort of

934
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,610
game it's like if the beeper got louder

935
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,360
if you were close to the car or the in

936
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,700
this case canister of chemicals that you

937
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,560
were tracking and it got quieter as you

938
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,390
got farther away and it helped the

939
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,750
police officer just kind of track the

940
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,580
you know not lose the cars that they

941
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,200
were searching for and what the beeper

942
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,450
cases said was as long as the thing

943
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,980
you're tracking is out on the public

944
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,570
street there's no reasonable expectation

945
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,190
of privacy so the Fourth Amendment

946
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,560
doesn't apply once the beeper gets into

947
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,590
a private place like a house or a garage

948
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,290
or something like that at that point you

949
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,970
need to get a warrant because it's

950
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:20,560
telling

951
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,270
is something about the interior of the

952
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,120
plot of a private protected space okay

953
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,240
so compare that that was when I was that

954
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,130
was when I was a kid back in the early

955
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,990
70s compare that with what we have now

956
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,290
with cell phones and with GPS not just

957
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,960
GPS in your phones but gps devices that

958
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,870
law enforcement can put on your car they

959
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,730
also have it where you can do like a

960
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,440
little blow dart so if you're you know

961
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,880
in a high-speed chase or something like

962
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,190
that you can kind of just shoot the GPS

963
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,660
dart and it sticks to the side of the

964
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,860
car and then you can just go back to

965
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,290
your police officer station and sort of

966
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,730
sit there and watch where the bad guys

967
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,620
go so there's what is GPS like these

968
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,060
deeper cases and the United States

969
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,680
government has argued it's basically the

970
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,720
same thing same rules apply you don't

971
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,250
have any kind of privacy on the public

972
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,050
streets so there's no fourth amendment

973
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,940
regulation of it and there's been a

974
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,280
whole bunch of debate over this in the

975
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,290
lower courts and some of the courts have

976
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,910
agreed with the government and applied

977
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,190
the beeper cases and a few quarts of not

978
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,530
a few courts have said the accuracy the

979
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,480
24-7 kind of surveillance that GPS

980
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,140
enables the specificity of that and the

981
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,760
fact that they could do that kind of

982
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,680
surveillance not just on one person not

983
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,650
just on hundred people but on everybody

984
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,420
if they wanted to that it's cheap enough

985
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,550
that they could do it on everybody makes

986
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,320
it a kind of surveillance technique

987
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,820
that's different in quality and

988
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,740
different in kind than what was

989
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,600
technologically enabled and what was

990
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,010
approved by the Supreme Court back in

991
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,020
the 1970s and there's a Supreme Court

992
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,960
case now and that we wrote a brief in

993
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,610
when it was in the lower court while i

994
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,800
was at eff the case is called the United

995
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,330
States versus Jones and the Supreme

996
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,970
Court is going to decide that so after

997
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,430
this term in the United States either

998
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,840
we're all going to be subject to

999
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,870
warrantless GPS tracking or there's

1000
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,430
going to be some requirement that courts

1001
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,290
say you know you've got to reuse them to

1002
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,060
do this there's some cause to track

1003
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,530
these people before you go ahead and do

1004
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:22,510
it what kinds of legal principles have

1005
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,270
government's brought to bear in order to

1006
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,360
try to deal with the challenge

1007
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,910
technologies provided to

1008
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,390
technologies pose to government secrecy

1009
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,210
there's a couple of tools they've used

1010
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,069
legally but there's two main ones the

1011
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:42,299
state secrets doctrine and and using

1012
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,400
national security espionage the

1013
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,990
Espionage Act for national security

1014
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,170
prosecutions the state secrets doctrine

1015
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,490
is a was I'm one of the earliest state

1016
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,849
secrets cases was back in the 1950s it

1017
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:59,970
involved a spy plane that was shot down

1018
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,339
this plane had some military people on

1019
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,099
it and some civilians and the surviving

1020
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,869
families of the civilian of the

1021
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,819
civilians sued the United States

1022
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,970
government and for wrongful death for

1023
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,710
their peep for the their family members

1024
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,380
having been killed on this plane and the

1025
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,230
government was able to kill the civil

1026
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,630
suit and not have to pay any damages or

1027
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,210
anything like that by invoking the state

1028
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,130
secrets doctrine and they said because

1029
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,339
this was a spy plane we can't litigate

1030
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,109
this case at all there's nothing we can

1031
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:32,609
say about this case that won't reveal

1032
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:35,640
United States secrets so children widows

1033
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,890
you guys are out of luck the case is

1034
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,930
over and the court agreed with that was

1035
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,190
the case of United States versus

1036
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,319
Reynolds now that was back in the 50s

1037
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,910
and since then those documents have been

1038
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,430
Declassified so you can go and look at

1039
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,140
what the documents were that the

1040
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,210
government had argued prohibited the

1041
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,740
widows from any kind of lawsuit for

1042
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,740
recovery and see what the report is and

1043
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,200
when you look at the report it basically

1044
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,119
says that there was secret equipment on

1045
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,220
the plane but it doesn't give any kind

1046
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,690
of details or information about what

1047
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,930
that secret equipment was and people

1048
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,190
already knew that there was secret

1049
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,390
equipment on the plane that had already

1050
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,000
been published in the press so you know

1051
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,069
sort of in retrospect looking back at

1052
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:18,809
this case with the benefit of all of the

1053
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:21,000
information there was no state secret

1054
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,299
that actually should have prohibited the

1055
00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:26,730
surviving family members of these people

1056
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,049
who had been killed from litigating

1057
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:29,450
their case and seeing whether in fact

1058
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,260
the United States should have been

1059
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,670
liable for wrongful death in that case

1060
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,450
and so that's our sort of a historical

1061
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,270
lesson about it yet the invocation of

1062
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,770
state secret privilege by the United

1063
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,800
States government has

1064
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,290
increased in recent years the United

1065
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,860
States has used that argument to

1066
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,750
basically disposed of without any kind

1067
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,700
of additional fact-finding or any sort

1068
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,400
of revelation about government activity

1069
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,100
in a couple of cases involving

1070
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,320
extraordinary rendition which is the

1071
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,440
term for kidnapping people exporting

1072
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,820
them to other countries and having them

1073
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,800
be tortured there and there were some

1074
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,950
lawsuits brought by a couple of

1075
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,480
individuals against the United States

1076
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,950
government for that practice and the

1077
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,680
government was able to basically kill

1078
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,900
those lawsuits without allowing any kind

1079
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,000
of discovery or further disclosure of

1080
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,740
information about that practice using

1081
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,650
the state secrets doctrine and the

1082
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,360
government also tried to use the state

1083
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,700
secrets doctrine to kill a lawsuit that

1084
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,090
the eff pursued started before I was

1085
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,030
there and pursued while i was there

1086
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,490
against the against AT&T the

1087
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,980
telecommunications carrier and in that

1088
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,240
case basically a whistleblower disclosed

1089
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,690
that AT&T was allowing government access

1090
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,300
to the switches so that the United

1091
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,580
States government could surveil

1092
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,380
communications telephone and Internet

1093
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,480
communications without a warrant in

1094
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,420
violation of United States law and the

1095
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,830
government the eff very intelligently

1096
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,920
sued AT&T but not the government in the

1097
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,560
first round of cases and the government

1098
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,720
intervened in that case and raised the

1099
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,520
state secrets doctrine and said that

1100
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,320
this is a you know said basically it's a

1101
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,780
secret who we surveil what we're doing

1102
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,210
there and the court initially rejected

1103
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,910
the state secrets doctrine which was

1104
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,620
kind of amazing considering all the

1105
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,020
other cases that had been that had been

1106
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,380
disposed of based on that argument but

1107
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,320
subsequently Congress passed a law that

1108
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,160
had the retroactive effect of killing

1109
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,480
that lawsuit and the court eventually

1110
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,200
did dismiss it and you know and a full

1111
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,970
discovery did not go forward and there

1112
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,350
wasn't further information about that

1113
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,230
that came out so state secrets doctrine

1114
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,020
retroactive statutes these are the kinds

1115
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,540
of thing that that my government's been

1116
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,720
able to use it

1117
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,090
to try to maintain government secrecy

1118
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,420
against a pressure by individuals and by

1119
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,580
activists and by civil libertarians to

1120
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,680
find out what exactly the government's

1121
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,200
been up to in prosecuting for example

1122
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,880
the war on terror and doing surveillance

1123
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,590
against people and taking advantage of

1124
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,320
technology I mentioned and I'll just

1125
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,060
briefly mention that there's also been

1126
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,040
more national security prosecutions

1127
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,590
under the Espionage Act under the Obama

1128
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,450
administration than ever before in

1129
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:23,810
united states history what other legal

1130
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,130
tools are there to try to protect

1131
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,960
privacy that's the government privacy

1132
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,630
what about individual privacy well I'll

1133
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,180
just talk a little tiny bit about class

1134
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,240
action privacy's lawsuits which is also

1135
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,670
something that I've been involved in you

1136
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,590
know one of the things that we have as a

1137
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:42,500
tool for individuals is the ability to

1138
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,330
sue somebody who causes you some kind of

1139
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,020
harm and there's been one of the major

1140
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,530
barriers to using civil liability to

1141
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,250
encourage basically companies to do

1142
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,980
better with privacy is that it's been

1143
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,839
very difficult under United States law

1144
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,900
to make a claim that there is a legally

1145
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,420
actionable harm that people suffer as a

1146
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,770
result of having their private

1147
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,740
information be disclosed so in a number

1148
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,510
of lawsuits they've said yes you know

1149
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:13,400
your private information is out there

1150
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,349
maybe it's embarrassing maybe it's not

1151
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:18,170
but what what harm is it to you if

1152
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,550
you're embarrassed or something that's

1153
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,490
just not the kind of damage that we

1154
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,640
recognize as being something that can be

1155
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,150
the basis for civil liability um so

1156
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,150
given that what we've seen is sort of

1157
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,599
this kind of prof legation of class

1158
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,700
action lawsuits under various different

1159
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,260
privacy statutes that have been passed

1160
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,530
but again these class-action lawsuits

1161
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,880
have not done a great job in protecting

1162
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,770
user privacy for a variety of reasons

1163
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,680
one is that the companies put stuff in

1164
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,390
the terms of service that give you

1165
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,369
people notice of all the stuff that

1166
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,450
they're going to do and so there's not

1167
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,160
great claims under that so where we have

1168
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,330
seen claims they've been for these

1169
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,550
really borderline things that don't

1170
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,700
necessarily

1171
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,980
have too much direct play with people's

1172
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,540
individual experience of trying to keep

1173
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,490
their information to themselves and to

1174
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,380
their friends and not not shared more

1175
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,579
publicly for example I'm involved now in

1176
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,920
a lawsuit and where I represent the

1177
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,010
company it's a lawsuit against Pandora

1178
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,349
music just do you guys have that you

1179
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:20,849
couldn't have that service here but it's

1180
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:23,339
basically an online music company where

1181
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,320
you can say you like a certain kind of

1182
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,849
music and then they play you other songs

1183
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:29,700
and there's a lawsuit under like a

1184
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,130
Michigan statute saying that Pandora

1185
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,109
disclosed too much information about

1186
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,119
what music people were listening to to

1187
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,250
anybody who knew the user's email

1188
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,280
address i represented yahoo in a lawsuit

1189
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,160
where they claimed that yahoo's

1190
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,349
california office should not be

1191
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:49,980
accepting search warrants and subpoenas

1192
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,140
that were issued by a court in a

1193
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,700
different state even though the court

1194
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,690
issued a warrant or subpoena was valid

1195
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,230
and these cases got dismissed but you

1196
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,660
know sort of when they last like the

1197
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,060
lawsuits that have been filed against

1198
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,109
let's say Facebook or Apple for various

1199
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:12,869
kinds of privacy disclosures they royal

1200
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,150
on for years and years and years and you

1201
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,460
know sort of in the end the practices of

1202
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,140
the companies are sort of the same and

1203
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,270
it's this you know very sort of

1204
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,819
expensive thing where the lawyers kind

1205
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:25,349
of get rich but in terms of what the

1206
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,300
users experience is there's really no

1207
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,190
tech and any kind of benefit for the

1208
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,980
users privacy wise so I mean that's my

1209
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,230
opinion but I think that's this is this

1210
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,000
is a varied to the extent that class

1211
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,500
action lawsuits could be used to

1212
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,180
encourage better corporate behavior it's

1213
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,510
a very dull very blunt tool if it works

1214
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:47,640
at all so um just to be sort of explicit

1215
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,920
about what i mean by works and maybe

1216
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,200
this has come clear and for me

1217
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,780
personally what I think works is

1218
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,359
something that protects individual

1219
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,690
privacy but yet allows people to know

1220
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,630
what the government is up to when some

1221
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,520
sort of carve outs for the types of

1222
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,410
things that maybe need to be kept

1223
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,640
confidential in order to protect

1224
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,150
people's lives and stuff but basically

1225
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:13,310
that ended that people should know what

1226
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,780
their government is up to and that we

1227
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,310
should have some ability to and

1228
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:19,340
therefore thereby act on that on that

1229
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,450
information and understand better or two

1230
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,010
to control better what it is our

1231
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:27,710
government does in our name so I you

1232
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,930
know in some I like individual privacy

1233
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,180
and I don't like government secrecy

1234
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,040
except in some very very narrow

1235
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,710
categories but it's a complicated

1236
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,320
balance even as I say it and so we

1237
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,090
shouldn't be that surprised that the law

1238
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,680
doesn't do that great a job of getting

1239
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,870
it right particularly when you consider

1240
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,390
the pressure of Technology how new the

1241
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,720
technology is and how slow the legal

1242
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,910
system is to react to those kinds of

1243
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,590
changes so what role can hackers play

1244
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,110
what role can activists play in this

1245
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:06,560
privacy security secrecy debate so back

1246
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,310
to the example of WikiLeaks in the

1247
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:13,640
investigation of WikiLeaks and who and

1248
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,500
how information got revealed to

1249
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,340
WikiLeaks via bradley manning the

1250
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,950
government issued secret orders and has

1251
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,140
continued to issue secret orders to

1252
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,810
providers for information about people

1253
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,390
who worked on the WikiLeaks project and

1254
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,750
so a couple of months ago the government

1255
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,640
issued orders secret orders that were

1256
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,500
not allowed the fact of which we're not

1257
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,220
allowed to be disclosed to Twitter and

1258
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,510
what Twitter did was Twitter turned

1259
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,130
around and demanded to be allowed to

1260
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,990
reveal to the users who are the subject

1261
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,460
of the investigation that these orders

1262
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,740
had issued and thereby let the users

1263
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,440
battle out in public in the court system

1264
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,300
whether these orders were properly

1265
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,880
issued or not and Twitter won that

1266
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,000
argument and there's a ongoing court

1267
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,880
case now that you can go and look at

1268
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,910
about what the orders were for and who

1269
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:10,580
they were about and what the course of

1270
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,090
the government investigation is in in

1271
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:16,060
regards to Manning and the WikiLeaks

1272
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,400
investigation there was also the

1273
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,360
anonymous attack

1274
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,570
on paypal for example so PayPal which is

1275
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:29,990
a you know online online transfer of

1276
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,140
money service along with many other

1277
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,730
companies under pressure from the United

1278
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,470
States government decided that they

1279
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,060
didn't want to that they were no longer

1280
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,860
going to about money in the form of

1281
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,750
donations or whatever to WikiLeaks and

1282
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,270
in retaliation people calling themselves

1283
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,880
anonymous decided to do a DDoS attack on

1284
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,560
paypal and bring the service down and

1285
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,190
they were able to do that I'm sure that

1286
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:54,290
many many many people who participated

1287
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,600
in that attack are never going to be

1288
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,730
found but there were a number of people

1289
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,580
who were found and there's about 15 or

1290
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,770
20 prosecutions in the united states now

1291
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:07,760
of people who were not crafty enough to

1292
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,070
hide their tracks and the FBI was able

1293
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,800
to find them being prosecuted for their

1294
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,350
participation in the paypal ddos attack

1295
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,550
so think about if your goal is

1296
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,890
government transparency and if your goal

1297
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,220
is to figure out what the government's

1298
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,410
up to either because you support

1299
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,910
wikileaks and you want to know or

1300
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,200
because you want to know how the

1301
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,030
government conducts investigations and

1302
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,230
who they're looking at and what their

1303
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,910
justification is for certain kinds of

1304
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,250
justifications my question is who did

1305
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,860
better in this did Twitter do better in

1306
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,630
terms of government transparency or did

1307
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,040
anonymous do better in terms of

1308
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,280
government transparency and Twitter's

1309
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,690
standing up to the government and asking

1310
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,090
for this disclosure told us more about

1311
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,220
what the government was up to then

1312
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,350
bringing down the paypal service for a

1313
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,630
little while ever did let me give you

1314
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,770
just leave you with just one other

1315
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,450
example of what I think is a really

1316
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:02,060
creative way to use both technology in

1317
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,570
the law and in order to shed more light

1318
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:10,330
on on what the government is up to so

1319
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,840
this is the story of Eric rockner he was

1320
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,580
arrested in Seattle a couple of years

1321
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,310
ago for playing urban golf so do you

1322
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,740
guys know what urban golf is basically

1323
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,430
you get a bunch of foam golf balls or

1324
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,790
real golf balls and you have a golf you

1325
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,140
know you and you basically go golfing

1326
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,510
around in a sort of mixture of a

1327
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,880
treasure hunt drunken

1328
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,730
like sort of tour of the city and eric

1329
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,009
was involved in this little game and he

1330
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:43,700
got contacted by police officers and

1331
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,650
they didn't like what he was doing and

1332
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,769
he had a bad attitude i think the

1333
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:51,049
officer said he had a brainiac attitude

1334
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:55,759
and so he got arrested and they decided

1335
00:54:55,759 --> 00:55:00,859
to charge him criminally so eric fought

1336
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:03,920
the case against him and as part of the

1337
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,079
evidence in the case against him he knew

1338
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,950
that police cars have front-mounted

1339
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,900
video cameras where often they take

1340
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,410
video footage of officer encounters with

1341
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,410
individuals and he as part of defending

1342
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,839
himself in the case asked for disclosure

1343
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,660
of that video footage so he could use it

1344
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,940
to defend himself and I guess to show

1345
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,829
that hat being a brainiac is not

1346
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,170
actually a crime and and shouldn't be

1347
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,519
the kind of thing that results in the

1348
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:33,049
difference between getting arrested and

1349
00:55:33,049 --> 00:55:34,519
not and get not getting arrested and

1350
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:37,490
there was a kind of complicated back and

1351
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,990
forth for the police officer where the

1352
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,630
law enforcement agency either didn't

1353
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,490
disclose all of the video or held it

1354
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,230
back at first they got some of it they

1355
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:48,410
didn't get all of it but eventually he

1356
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,029
got the criminal case against him

1357
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:53,930
dismissed and then he turned around and

1358
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,230
he sued the law enforcement agency and

1359
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,150
said you know you it was a false arrest

1360
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,859
you didn't disclose all the video

1361
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:03,529
information to me and as part of that

1362
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,349
lawsuit he asked for discovery of what

1363
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:09,400
all the logs were from their different

1364
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,720
recording of their interactions with

1365
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,130
suspects that he received that

1366
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,279
information in discovery of his lawsuit

1367
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:19,279
for the wrongful for their wrongful

1368
00:56:19,279 --> 00:56:23,779
arrest then he turned around and he's

1369
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:27,109
put all of that information the logs of

1370
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:30,289
who was recorded when and not who was

1371
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:32,569
recorded but when video surveillance was

1372
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,549
taken but with police encounters and

1373
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:36,410
individuals he put that up online on his

1374
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:39,009
webpage so if you had an encounter with

1375
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:42,230
this particular police agency you can go

1376
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,089
online now and look and see whether you

1377
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:44,790
were

1378
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,790
videotaped and in your criminal case

1379
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,260
they failed to turn over this

1380
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,940
information about you which could help

1381
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,920
you and your defense and could help

1382
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,220
clear you of charges if the officers you

1383
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,200
know basically arrested you for a false

1384
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,120
reason the same way that they arrested

1385
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,190
Eric so you know and I look at the

1386
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,530
examples of people like Chris Nagoya nor

1387
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:10,800
like Eric or Twitter and the way that

1388
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,020
people have been able to creatively use

1389
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,420
a combination of Technology and the law

1390
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,080
in order to you to protect themselves or

1391
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,600
protect their own privacy to shed light

1392
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,940
on the way that the government uses

1393
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,960
technology to surveil us or to disclose

1394
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,940
information about the way that the

1395
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,130
government works or about the way that

1396
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,080
or about corporate products or that sort

1397
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,850
of thing that is the kind of thing that

1398
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,470
people want to know so that they can

1399
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:38,850
keep themselves safe and keep themselves

1400
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,290
secure to me that's the essence of the

1401
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,410
hacker ethic and the essence of being

1402
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:50,520
truly innovative about pursuing pursuing

1403
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,620
freedom and pursuing privacy and

1404
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:57,530
pursuing security using both the law and

1405
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:00,630
technology so that's what I wanted to

1406
