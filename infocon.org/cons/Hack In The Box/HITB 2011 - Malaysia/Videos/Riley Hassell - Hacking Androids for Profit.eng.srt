1
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,190
I hope you have a consumers are being

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,430
attacked

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,760
model this using Android is some new

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,920
model giving the either the whole

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
decision-making process to the consumer

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,599
which has its you know pros and cons I

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,369
mean the difference is consumers aren't

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,349
security professionals so really have to

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,668
polish that information before you pass

10
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,500
it off to them just other things we'll

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,040
talk about during the presentation a big

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,960
thing here the apps are adequately

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,129
reviewed before being prior published a

14
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,059
lot different variances here but

15
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,220
basically anybody can create an app they

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,199
spend the current price with twenty

17
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,000
fifty dollars you find publishing wise

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
since you can push a nap out now you can

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,360
create whatever you want from any

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,219
company there's no validation process at

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,989
all a little bit of malware scanning

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,000
happens from what I've been hearing but

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
that's minor looking for the basic that

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,000
the facebook virus classes or malware

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,910
crosses rubber in this case the android

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,470
marketplace the biggest where is site in

27
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,750
the world currently plus this besides

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,800
third-party markets which we'll talk

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,770
about as being a much bigger threat here

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,500
so what my biggest pet peeves is is how

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,539
the permissions are displayed for

32
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,770
example to read phone state permission

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,020
when you consumers see this they see

34
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,970
allows root access or read only access

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,599
to phone state it's not descriptive for

36
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,190
us here we have an idea and we would

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,509
learn read about and we know what to

38
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,340
accept but for consumers for our loved

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,140
ones got other people they have no idea

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,000
they have no idea for example we know

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
maybe we should say we can read your

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,349
cell phone's ESN your phone number sim

43
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:41,429
card serial like all these really

44
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:43,410
sensitive things but instead we have

45
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,360
this basic description we can read the

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,550
phone state which the most people says

47
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,649
like visit the power state is it on or

48
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,289
off there's a whole layer there that

49
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,509
this not being not being abstracted

50
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,190
there's a whole that we're missing a

51
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,569
hold the whole point of kickin

52
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,039
information and presenting to the user

53
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,739
in a way they can understand technology

54
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,390
versus you know productivity it's a bit

55
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,500
of a person ation this is a big issue

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,690
which we'll talk about more for example

57
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,068
I can go and create an app called Angry

58
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,650
Birds three from you know Moscow

59
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,690
industries and put it up now I'll get

60
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,580
five thousand downloads there's no

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,720
there's no one there saying that you

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,980
should be able to push angry very angry

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,500
birds three I should be ale to be MSNBC

64
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,220
to calm there's not the process there so

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,780
that's kind of big things that there's

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,800
only things a place in the Restless

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,020
presentation

68
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,030
as if it was mrs. developers can

69
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,320
masquerade as legitimate products but I

70
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,240
just talked about John override

71
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,550
providing a good example of this with

72
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,190
his ruse trap example so roots r after

73
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,960
you guys haven't seen this basically

74
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,190
it's a serious up it's an app that can

75
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,320
pull down native payloads and exploit

76
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,450
the colonel and Linux John pies these

77
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,530
things into sleep he's going to do

78
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,840
colonel bug like ever a couple of months

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,060
so he created this example made it a

80
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,830
theme bump twilight the twilight you

81
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,950
know movie series and whatnot and it as

82
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,270
soon as he installed it people start

83
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,290
download again and using it right so it

84
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,220
goes in this whole thing I talked about

85
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,140
as far as the idea of getting people to

86
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,180
open things has changed they will open

87
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,360
them their consumers right and your pump

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,310
you pushing it out to a 300 million

89
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,440
people not a thousand people at a

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,720
company disparition attack so your odds

91
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,370
change dramatically the whole the whole

92
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,670
attack rivers changes so Reese to

93
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,130
Android users now we're going to talk of

94
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,570
each category here going to depth about

95
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,610
the the main risks that we found that

96
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,170
are out there in the marketplace and for

97
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,230
Frank road users using the phone so mal

98
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,870
were so this is a big thing the

99
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,590
everywhere in the press you're going to

100
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,000
hear about all the malware on the

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,500
android marketplace there really isn't

102
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,570
that much you know I make a software

103
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,830
product for antivirus I'm shooting

104
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,480
myself in the foot here I think a third

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
to be honest there's maybe a few dozen

106
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,770
main categories and those two variants

107
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,209
there's a few hundred that's all it's

108
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,490
theater but that being said third party

109
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,470
markets are a whole other story right

110
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,660
when you get into China about China

111
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,790
through 40 markets the rest of Asia

112
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,980
South America it's a lot different you

113
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,959
see a lot more of the end of these

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,150
things also the sophistication of the

115
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,340
Mao are back in the windows error when

116
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,959
we saw these things we get with 10,000 a

117
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,300
week now new variants but the

118
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,070
advancement of the malware is much

119
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,780
different than we saw on one does oh you

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,950
know over a period of several weeks

121
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,200
we've seen you know these basic malware

122
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,540
candidates that just you know send SMS

123
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,669
text messages for pay services for these

124
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,100
things like I think it's nick bought my

125
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,830
maybe one example where the the payload

126
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,900
will have GPS coordinates and based on

127
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,910
where you go and will court background

128
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,550
audio then fire it off over a cobra

129
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,440
channel with someone this is where we're

130
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,150
at now much different we've seen in

131
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,430
Windows I just grabbing some HTML file

132
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,470
make this in some cash are some credit

133
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,740
RSS and some other things now trend

134
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,150
Trojans are a new thing we're seeing too

135
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,380
and I talked about this too angry birds

136
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,060
where I can go upload an app called

137
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,550
spider-man four and I'll get up you know

138
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,250
10,000 downloads so the people follow

139
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,660
the trends like an election comes up

140
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,670
they make an election app right new

141
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,990
movie comes out there's a movie app I

142
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,000
remain for app so everybody's writing

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,100
these trends and it just puts pushing

144
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,510
out malware and people want that feature

145
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,480
so bad the day they the normal process

146
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,800
that go through to validate these things

147
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,510
they just want it so badly install it so

148
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,550
you have this trend Trojan contain going

149
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,900
on that really impacts the security you

150
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,040
people that you know that are careful

151
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,450
about it so what it's all gasp is a

152
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,670
serious the steps you can take to help

153
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,260
her to protect yourself I think the most

154
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,610
important thing that this common sense

155
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,170
but still you know there's are things

156
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,850
that you think about the longevity of

157
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,550
the app right like it hasn't been around

158
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,380
for nine days nine days is kind of

159
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,360
ballpark that we see where people you

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,620
know you've got these guys that are

161
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,030
looking at mile or analyzing the market

162
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,800
but we call scraping downloading the

163
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,810
marketplace analyzing apps they usually

164
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,090
find them in a net the net ballpark 60

165
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,590
to 90 days and they find them by item

166
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,810
you know died give them a name and a

167
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,730
smaller so if it's there for longer than

168
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,260
that then you're no you're you're not

169
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,460
saved but you're you're in a better

170
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,870
place and your work is there for a week

171
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,110
right the readings are always good too

172
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,120
but keep mine ratings are like

173
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,220
everything else right where you can pay

174
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,990
people and outsource it to go in fake

175
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,110
ratings like look at yelp right you have

176
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,910
a thousand posting the guy with the same

177
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,860
writing right where he's got like dash

178
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,930
initial dash initial for every single

179
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,520
comment he's been paid to do that so

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,620
keep in mind that ratings or ratings are

181
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,630
useful but look at the diversity of the

182
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,000
ratings keep in mind that if they're too

183
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,100
similar that can be faked anything else

184
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,680
but it's always a ticket factor

185
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,669
developers I mean because developer

186
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,020
microsoft has developers someone that

187
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,550
you've installed software for that you

188
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,280
trust is it Microsoft with a zero those

189
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,210
kind of things right we've seen a

190
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,790
certificate validation issues the

191
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,040
permissions are a big giveaway I talked

192
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,990
about this earlier where permissions

193
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,150
give information but they don't describe

194
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,070
the person really entails what you're

195
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,530
going to get so for example I say like

196
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,820
you get the spider-man poor app I use

197
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,070
frequently you know it asks for

198
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,960
privileges to receive SMS messages

199
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,910
there's a game really need to receive

200
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,520
and look at your tech messages

201
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,410
so it's a little too common sense there

202
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,580
I mean these things should need no

203
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,650
privilege besides maybe internet that

204
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,690
most to post staffs about the game or if

205
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,830
you're in an office top should have an

206
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,419
internet access I mean if it's a

207
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,280
telecommuting up yeah it makes sense to

208
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,229
have those things but a lot of these

209
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,639
apps like you'd look if you go online

210
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,319
right now and search for weight loss or

211
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,240
something pornographic or gambling or

212
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,740
anything else they'll ask for all the

213
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,800
permissions it's a dead giveaway right

214
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
what you getting into to look for those

215
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,020
things keep an eye on so the autorun

216
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,690
thing is get interesting when you create

217
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,550
an app you can create our receivers I

218
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,289
event handler so you see in cloud

219
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,150
computing platforms for a certain events

220
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,039
will trigger an action in this case you

221
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,539
can have one eye that maybe want to apps

222
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:37,120
install there someone changes a GUI from

223
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,889
one element to another for all these

224
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,169
events that it'll kickstart your app so

225
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,819
even if you install it you don't run it

226
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,900
it can still be running in the

227
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,900
background no so that this is can

228
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,219
interesting because all the security ops

229
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,919
center RS products because the framework

230
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,169
what we have we can't scan the apps and

231
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,330
totally been installed the other vendors

232
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,680
and third parties they don't give us

233
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,050
access to stop the install so there's

234
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,759
always like ring behind the scenes that

235
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,560
happens to trying to make this you know

236
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
to kill processes and there's still a

237
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,130
window there where an out can be

238
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,750
installed and run so it's a pretty big

239
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,310
issue this is this is a bypass on most

240
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,690
VAV that's out there right just

241
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,490
currently unless your vendor bonded

242
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,039
which I mean you know win mode win phone

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,330
seven there's nothing you can do for

244
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,400
Colonel drivers got me in there androids

245
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,650
pre-cut about it I phone the same way so

246
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,229
keep in mind that security that these

247
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,270
products offer does it we do offer some

248
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,259
security but there's these little

249
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,969
caveats because of what the framework

250
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,610
provides we can't overcome shooting

251
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,649
myself in the foot again but in honest

252
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:36,370
there so Wi-Fi hazards which I've trivum

253
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,229
in this room is family familiar with it

254
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,690
but um some interesting caveats with

255
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,120
with uh with the apps many apps don't

256
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,829
encrypt wireless don't encrypt traffic

257
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,600
right you hear about the auth token

258
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,250
issue maybe without a lot of google apps

259
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,260
and services where the opto can use to

260
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,970
sign into all your services that one

261
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,680
token that you lined up login to gmail

262
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,779
can be replayed to log into Google Docs

263
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,100
or anything else which we'll talk about

264
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,649
more later so about these services are

265
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,029
encrypted now Google is now equipping

266
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,550
their the other apps but you have this

267
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,579
rush to market

268
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:06,949
right where I mean how many people are

269
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,059
going to write an athlete we go to

270
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,069
barnes noble they buy a book and android

271
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,110
apps for dummies a month later they have

272
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,639
an app out i'm not going to go spend

273
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,989
five ten thousand dollars have a

274
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,850
security company audit their app so

275
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,069
these kind of things are a big deal

276
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,910
they're going to raise to push it out

277
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,899
and you're getting and we see these

278
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,420
things and not not really in almost

279
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,879
every app we look at you see these

280
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,559
things we're dealing with consumers

281
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,749
making software not 20-year veteran

282
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,670
engineers making software we're dealing

283
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,869
with opportunists so keep my awesome on

284
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:37,220
the phones when it phones off in the

285
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,269
background you're constantly seeking

286
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,069
services so if your phone is just

287
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,239
sitting there so you go to your favorite

288
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,100
coffee shop all right you log on once

289
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,799
and you connect when you're a range you

290
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,839
walk in there tomorrow morning and you

291
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,309
just installed for Neil apps get a cup

292
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:50,929
of coffee but your phone just logged on

293
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,519
now let's think data over the wire

294
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,449
you've got some guy sitting in the

295
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,339
corner with a week an arrow dump or some

296
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,929
sort of sniffer capturing your traffic

297
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,629
if there's tokens there then this is a

298
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,009
big issue when you're auditing android

299
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,569
apps for mobile apps the leak privacy is

300
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,369
a huge issue but also hiral to the study

301
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:05,779
about this and found that the majority

302
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,139
of apps leaked information not a sum but

303
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,759
a few but the majority we're talking

304
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,549
like eighty percent of the house and I'm

305
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,100
hackers can hijack graph accounts payson

306
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,299
f you guys may be a fuser seen

307
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,279
interesting app that you can run a

308
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,319
wireless network like a public Wi-Fi and

309
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,929
you can you can hijack facebook accounts

310
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:27,129
how could people working there some

311
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,389
recommendations uncheck connect within

312
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,669
range you know getting a developer

313
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:33,079
behavior of connecting when you need to

314
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,720
and kick in so when you're walking by

315
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,860
all these places your phone's just not

316
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,480
connecting automatically and risking

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,369
your earphone to compromise only tech

318
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:41,449
when you need so it's in one of those

319
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,549
tasks that seems mundane but it makes

320
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:46,339
difference right any auto connect

321
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:47,869
functionality which is that enabled by

322
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:49,730
default I'll effect on in secure

323
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,290
networks these things turn those off at

324
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,749
fishing this is interesting so world

325
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,029
apps can masquerade as legitimate apps

326
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,579
you trust right so they have the idea is

327
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,290
that an app when installed will wait for

328
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,489
an activity in the background like wait

329
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,860
for you to login to your back right and

330
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,899
then overlaying a screen on top of the

331
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,879
same log and everything else which

332
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,039
convenient can be pulled out of

333
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,329
disassembly and just paste it into your

334
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,080
fishing

335
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,240
out so it behaves identically the app

336
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,530
you look out there's no distinguishing

337
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,630
marker all right you can take the code

338
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,230
and rebuild it as a new app so thinking

339
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,250
like a clip jack and this whole thing

340
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,840
with flash that happen sending for

341
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,060
android so we've a demo here with a show

342
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,660
about fishing so here I'm going to go

343
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,140
ahead and spawn skype as an example

344
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,220
sorry Oh a few those that I met last

345
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,550
night that working on skype in auditing

346
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,840
mm-hmm so we're going to log in to

347
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,370
attempt logging this fixed account that

348
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,580
we have reserved private your labs I'm

349
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,960
give it a moment it's going to fail so

350
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,970
it's the real skype application right

351
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,430
okay there's me fumbling tired on an

352
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,180
airplane going back so now we're now

353
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,350
we're going to install on the i'm

354
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,640
running a TB to install an app in the

355
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,350
background to do the a fishing to

356
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,690
demonstrate that so that's going to kick

357
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,280
open as a quick flash hook called apt

358
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,960
jack now i'm going to run skype again

359
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,360
same screen my type in test slowly test

360
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,600
again i'm gonna click sign in your

361
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,810
passwords test alright see if all that

362
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,880
that make sense so i created in half and

363
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,070
i overlaid it then i closed it out now

364
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,900
comprise the credentials so let's

365
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,210
protect that one when you install an app

366
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,840
things like read logs or get tasks those

367
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,860
are used to get information about the

368
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,270
system like what processes are running

369
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,040
most apps don't mean that in fact few

370
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,960
apps use the only apps you really need

371
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,550
to give privileges for or assisting

372
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,430
utilities or security products games and

373
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,720
your typical office document can have

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
all those things you don't need any

375
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,930
privileges for their basic apps they

376
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,520
open they create documents they save

377
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,260
them if they upload them to a website or

378
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,220
you can share maybe internet

379
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,480
successfully you know acceptable but

380
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,100
read logs and get tasks there's really

381
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,430
no reason for that normal app a bigger a

382
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,320
big kick like or a trigger you can see

383
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,270
is when you log in to your normal app

384
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,680
and all your credentials are normally

385
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,660
saved if you save them aren't there like

386
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,670
in the previous example the private your

387
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,890
labs was not there right they can't get

388
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,630
access that sensitive data and the other

389
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,210
compartmentalised a product directory so

390
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,260
those things aren't there it's kind of a

391
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,660
vision

392
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,670
cue to help help you kind of lean up

393
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,870
trigger something that you may have an

394
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,920
appt fishing thing especially if you

395
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,060
just start install about it Piderman

396
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,500
pork all right keep that in mind um so

397
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,940
rootkits are somewhat new we haven't

398
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,500
seen a lot of them there's proof of

399
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,440
concept / def con aid there's an Android

400
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,730
look at these guys wrote or spiderlabs

401
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,100
it works and there's this whole kind of

402
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,720
theory that rootkits and all these poem

403
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
platforms in Hardware you know it's not

404
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,740
going to work it's all arm ok you can

405
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,000
write an arm five and we'll work on

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,700
anything ok if you don't have symbols

407
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,930
you can still fingerprint this is called

408
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,090
table based on bit you know basic

409
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,530
antivirus techniques we've done 15 years

410
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,850
ago you can find a table you can put

411
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,070
your pointers in root kits are beyond

412
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,620
possible but the thing is that the

413
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,580
people that are writing this stuff

414
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,350
aren't putting it on the market so what

415
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,700
we've seen privately from our it's a

416
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
response wing the only time we've seen

417
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,030
these are part of zero-day attacks

418
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,460
someone has a thread like an SMS or an

419
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,870
image bug or something they launch that

420
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,810
metal trigger and software rootkit only

421
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,080
times these things are the river also

422
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,000
apps that utilize jailbreak can also

423
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,530
stop work it's obviously you have to

424
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,000
have root to install rootkit alright

425
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,440
makes sense oh yeah this of my my angry

426
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,390
slide it's not a whole lot you can

427
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,950
really do about rickets because the

428
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,150
framework you can't get in the kernel

429
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,330
right so once they're there the whole

430
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,310
like you know the whole Zen proverb the

431
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,600
whole tree in the forest kind of thing

432
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,220
rootkits there you're not going to find

433
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,410
it right you can query all you want it's

434
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,400
a good rootkit you're not going to see

435
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,470
it so this is a obviously an issue

436
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,060
luckily we haven't seen a lot of these

437
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,800
attack in the marketplace there there

438
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,480
are targeted attacks company to company

439
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,930
government-to-government kind of thing

440
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,000
so Bob nets are really interesting as

441
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,460
far as a mobile platform this is a few

442
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,740
framework circulating around bit allow

443
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,940
up on that kind of service command

444
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,110
control channels like we've seen in

445
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,230
malware they give an example here where

446
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,630
all the india the features of a mobile

447
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,520
phone you can use where you can record

448
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,290
video right someone's talking on the

449
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,790
phone and they're walking around your

450
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,530
video snapshots the room they're in and

451
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,720
the audio so you have face print

452
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,340
voiceprint analysis you have the

453
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,680
location the wealth information that can

454
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,010
be used with this as staggering so as i

455
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,810
said a mobile echelon you guys from

456
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,970
allah tester lon these resources will be

457
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,110
tapped at some point if not already

458
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,530
tapped taking yourself or you know same

459
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,260
type thing

460
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,610
I mean as much as we can offer is be

461
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,150
careful apps you install the same time

462
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,960
you know there's a whole lot you can do

463
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,340
if you have guys that can write a mobile

464
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,540
bout botnet and do these kind of things

465
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,090
I mean the best thing you can do is it's

466
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,290
just not install apps that you don't

467
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,740
trust it would be be careful about it

468
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,850
under some more preventive measures will

469
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,340
talk about related the physical

470
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,780
boundaries thing is really interesting

471
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,650
so mobile platforms are obviously mobile

472
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,030
so I compromised a fun of some of them

473
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,890
someone the audience for example then

474
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,540
when you walk by starbucks outside or a

475
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,640
coffee shop but you sign into now can

476
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,040
attack that and you go home now I'm

477
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,420
attacking your home network then you go

478
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,640
to work how am I talking that so when

479
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,110
you when you have a botnet of up being

480
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,280
of a laptop if you're saying but when

481
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,500
you have a mobile phone all these nodes

482
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,840
move around constantly different

483
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,730
networks so it's much more powerful to

484
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,440
very alluring to her attackers so we

485
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,550
haven't seen a lot of these but yeah

486
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,810
that they will come when people realize

487
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,310
how valuable that is it's really

488
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,920
interesting because that's my same

489
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,540
premise you know don't I talked about

490
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,430
previously don't auto enable auto

491
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,250
connects hackers don't deal with

492
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,990
security products are they'll write

493
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,700
exploits to get around security products

494
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,650
they're right proof of concepts so if

495
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,670
you have another layer they're usually

496
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,660
that'll stop them we've talked about it

497
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,750
here through a firewall out for example

498
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,430
exercise college when song apps table

499
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,380
other Asia there's an app called

500
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,360
antivert by this guy yet so I talked to

501
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,520
spread of cool it's a metasploit app for

502
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,040
Android so you can run metasploit from

503
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,260
your android network here on all these

504
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,250
things are kind of popping up there a

505
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,990
lot of them are foreign technologies

506
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,920
really need stuff jailbreaking is a

507
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,060
hates of united by my phone is

508
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,089
jailbroken all the phones our lab we use

509
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,470
but when you jailbreak a phone that

510
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,420
technology is that that do the

511
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,280
escalation of the transition from basic

512
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,540
privilege to root or complete garbage

513
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,190
complete utter garbage there's no

514
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,630
security developed in mind of whole

515
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,180
point to get your root for example there

516
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,670
the idea we need trust an escalation you

517
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,110
trust the parent process they took you

518
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,360
of the channel process so say acne app

519
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,480
runs vash or some shell so you trust act

520
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,790
me to run back but these these popular

521
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,060
90 jailbreaking packages just trust bash

522
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,650
and then it's the fall to remember

523
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,570
so we're when you install it and you use

524
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,460
it now you're trusting the show so any

525
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,770
future app can just run su for Michelle

526
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,470
and have root sony jumper going phone

527
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,310
keep that in mind animal intuitive users

528
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,470
trust bash as i said you can you just

529
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,500
invoke su don't jailbreak your phone

530
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,570
save a better solution yeah it's not a

531
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,070
thing for consumers if you're a security

532
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,780
expert he knows you're doing you can do

533
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,830
it but keep that in mind that you're

534
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,320
opening yourself up that any app can use

535
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,630
that and they do most malware now will

536
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,740
check for that don't ask you and look

537
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,320
for you know what for a pound sign so

538
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,370
keep that in mind second thing like when

539
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,140
I asked her into a proven app for

540
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,240
escalation uncheck the like super user

541
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,280
apk for example in android uncheck the

542
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,780
remember box each time so it's every

543
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,670
time you get you could ask you can you

544
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,100
can allow for that instance so that they

545
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,150
don't kind of counteract to hold the

546
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,730
whole problem there too as well so

547
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,990
hacking Android tools next ajar mom take

548
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,500
add X which is the compiled dalvik a

549
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,480
compiled code convert to a jar you can

550
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
do you compile into java source apktool

551
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,860
is a great tool you can assemble into a

552
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,720
language like they call it Smalley

553
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,570
specific enough jasmine so it's a you

554
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,040
know a textual representation of the

555
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,260
assembly that you can use pull the

556
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,550
invite APK toys you can ought you can

557
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,080
change things they happen to rebuild it

558
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,780
which will talk about the benefits later

559
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,100
desert lecture pretty cool decompile use

560
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,710
guys were out at a psu and allows you

561
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,880
did you can pause the cobra it's much

562
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
cleaner they go through in a little

563
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,780
olive redundancy and in class love the

564
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,070
optimization that happens they remove

565
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,630
that out you clean up the code so it's

566
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,300
much better to read if used x ajar your

567
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,220
codes not reliable the guys have wrote

568
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,410
that haven't updated it in eons it's all

569
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,270
the complex bar loops recursive logic

570
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,140
all those things will get dropped

571
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,330
exception handlers get dropped so that's

572
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,350
pretty good it takes a little time to

573
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,990
set up but it's much more reliable so

574
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,520
source own size final my favorite tools

575
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,650
is monitor if you guys you source inside

576
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm all about highlighting information

577
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,830
you can load your entire store space and

578
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,260
do it all your smaller decompiling we

579
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,090
create a custom template for Smalling

580
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,590
and jasmine so that the highlighting

581
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,490
from you the methods and all those

582
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,230
things we can see and you can do cross

583
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,310
references you can go from language to

584
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,950
language the language it's really need

585
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,620
the binary editor

586
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,120
your Papa native Irish theme you can

587
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,470
create templates as well for certain

588
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,730
file format so you can walk all the

589
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,770
structures and change things and all my

590
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,030
clip it's check sums all the stuff

591
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,590
pretty cool and of course i def

592
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,730
everybody's desire in reverse

593
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,140
engineering you're looking at a tip code

594
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,670
you have to have a good tool that's

595
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,190
pretty much the de facto standard okay

596
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,050
building Android source so this is

597
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,210
pretty much a nightmare right now I've

598
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,490
spent a year neck deep in android when I

599
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,540
want to build some sorts of testing the

600
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,850
findings it's last month to get it to

601
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,930
get it working as a nightmare especially

602
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,910
colonel over got hacked you're getting

603
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,770
if these random locations so if you're

604
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,660
going to build it start with a boot to

605
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,250
64-bit they're going to tell you that 32

606
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,080
bit works which you can end up making a

607
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,580
hundred changes to your to your files to

608
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,950
make it work just get 64 bit and use

609
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,620
that then pre-built binary is a lot of

610
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,330
good ones out there you know as it lists

611
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,730
here gtb services be done on and on

612
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,930
they're useful to have their already

613
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,730
pre-built so you just push them to your

614
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,670
phone and use them ok so the auditing

615
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,020
process things to look for now we

616
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,090
getting the really fun stuff starting to

617
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,230
talk about security halls we found

618
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,690
things we've seen in android we'll go

619
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,910
through each individually so permissions

620
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,730
as i talked about as far as malware now

621
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,140
when you're auditing and gives you an

622
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,280
interesting kingdom there's a thing

623
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,680
called a tax surface area a SI when you

624
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,480
look at the technology you want to get

625
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,950
all the way as input and come into it

626
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,570
that's researcher testing you work your

627
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,250
way to the car and you have like two

628
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,050
down up top down kind of strategies but

629
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,580
it'll get you around the entry points

630
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,510
the most important part of an

631
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,010
application the part that remote

632
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,100
attacker can touch right so in these

633
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,630
cases like read logs we have an example

634
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,670
we know visit if it's reading logs can i

635
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,980
write to a log and cause a problem

636
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,420
internet meaning it's making a leak for

637
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,310
information or there's a web view or

638
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,420
some browse that's being used and

639
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,640
receiving me a receive SMS which is like

640
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,890
the holy grail for bug finding meaning

641
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,850
if there's a bug on out i can send a

642
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,140
text message to anyone here and

643
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,650
compromise your android phone right

644
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,270
that's that so we see those unless is

645
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,440
one of those ones i could use if it's a

646
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,320
really nasty permission

647
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,389
so for example Norton security the

648
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:00,549
latest version they have a buddy system

649
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,230
for their anti-theft where I can assign

650
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,840
a buddy with a phone number and they can

651
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,210
locate my phone if I lose it and it's

652
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,139
trusted to their phone number

653
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:10,529
unfortunately this feature never worked

654
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,190
apparently I don't have anybody ever

655
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,990
tested it and said I from a different

656
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,460
phone number it just doesn't check the

657
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,080
number in fact the code is not there to

658
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,110
check the number it just skips over it

659
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,279
so I don't know where things get

660
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,619
disconnected there but um so that you

661
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,049
also have a password right that you know

662
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,970
you know did you have to use to us apply

663
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,070
these commands but the password there's

664
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,409
no strict guidelines so my test I found

665
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:34,299
with are you know with our assessments

666
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,059
group people chose like pee or password

667
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,590
run security professional service and

668
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,499
consumers okay so the bar is different

669
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:43,419
we have to remember that and of course

670
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:45,249
even if you have an SMS even if this

671
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,080
feature did work he can scoop text

672
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,389
messages and you been happening for a

673
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:50,740
very long time it's it's a word text

674
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,669
messages you can spoof ooh see I buddy

675
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,289
verification is broken pass / guideline

676
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:59,379
strength doesn't exist and there's no

677
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,820
limit proper ization failures and

678
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,830
they're not shown to the user so i can

679
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,159
send 10,000 text messages to you in

680
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,509
every pastor i could possibly think of

681
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:08,769
and you're never going to know about it

682
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,690
although when i get a response saying

683
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,240
location is 10 meters from you you know

684
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,669
where you're out so it's a combination

685
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:17,799
of critical point failures you know

686
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,539
security and layers when you're a part

687
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,619
of a security company is I develop a

688
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:22,899
solution which layers broken you have

689
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,700
four or five of them it's not a good

690
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,429
thing alright I will probably not be

691
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,480
doing any work for symantec after this

692
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,980
activity reuse so this is as is pretty

693
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,889
exciting so if you think back to windows

694
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:38,289
and X the windows environments gets good

695
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,570
candidate we have our PC services when

696
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,129
you call a service that service can

697
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,649
impersonate the caller so it acting on

698
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,389
their behalf of their privileges and

699
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:48,570
technology's been around for 14 years

700
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,799
but an Android when you call an app's

701
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,840
activity like I call you know like say a

702
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,879
feature in some app like 12 hours in a

703
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:57,820
tweet it's being run as Twitter there's

704
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,220
no impersonated so keep that in mind you

705
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,600
can call all these different pieces of

706
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,460
the application and I'll run as that app

707
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,980
well that's going to taxes look out

708
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,010
we talked about how to find these then

709
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,600
we have free tools I'll provide an email

710
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,280
address if you guys are purists we wrote

711
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,049
some scanning tools it'll scan for apps

712
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:15,610
that the Explorer activities those kind

713
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,350
of things are up in the community so we

714
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,809
look at a second or 18 apps we actually

715
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,570
did 10,000 but this is the early report

716
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,270
and out of those three 3582 or

717
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,160
activities this is the results of the

718
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,600
ones that were exported without without

719
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,450
kicking privileges it's almost all we go

720
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,830
back the same thing as consumers reading

721
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,919
software write something this is not sup

722
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,570
necessarily their job to make software

723
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,010
security there's no one tell him to make

724
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,780
software secure they want to get in I'm

725
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,890
gonna hold its cool model thing that's

726
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,450
happening and put out push out apps you

727
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,400
can't blame them right so uh you think

728
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,070
activities is a pretty big deal I before

729
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,410
this early this year in skype if you see

730
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,510
here he created tent or think about like

731
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,970
an RPC packet or on record or anything

732
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,980
else where I have a packet I'm firing

733
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,230
out to a process like an IPC packet you

734
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,700
provide data that you attach to it in

735
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,940
sealable envelope here i have the

736
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,960
basically like a variables are parts

737
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,490
that are parsed in the call target the

738
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,040
type the phone number all right i stop

739
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,320
the activity remotely and i'm making a

740
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,570
phone call let's go it's any phone

741
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,730
number that i choose so your pay for use

742
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,929
kind of things are obviously an issue

743
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,910
here malware SQL injection so androids

744
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,010
mobile SQL injection right this would be

745
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,870
the guest and it uses SQL is probably

746
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,990
vulnerable to SQL injection and I'm like

747
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,040
rediscovering the wheel here collect a

748
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,980
fourth time in my career but one thing

749
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,540
is interesting about this the reason I

750
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,299
mentioned this is it developers are new

751
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:48,460
to software again if you see I'm pushing

752
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,750
a point here about consumers being new

753
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,820
to software allow them don't understand

754
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,799
SQL don't wanna kill prepared statement

755
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,179
so they read it quick SQL query they

756
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,220
copy and paste from you know code

757
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,500
project or some site that works for

758
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,510
querying a simple database now they have

759
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,510
string based queries so the rubble SQL

760
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,210
injection and most of the products use

761
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,509
string bass queries not a few almost

762
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:12,099
as a message its preferred by new

763
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,909
developers versus the SQLite am I doing

764
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,879
here okay on my slide that over looks

765
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,239
XML objection so we're moving on to this

766
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:24,789
this is preferred versus SQL XML is

767
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,190
simpler the frameworks easy to use yeah

768
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,329
things like shared preferences all the

769
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,789
stuff that can use of course they don't

770
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,919
say it isn't for XML I mean some of

771
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:34,570
these new to writing software they're

772
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,919
not gonna get xml objection as the

773
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,839
bottom corner of security it's one of

774
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,849
those niche attack classes that we learn

775
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,739
over time but it's really applicable but

776
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:43,299
it's important so of course the

777
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,949
developers don't know about this I'm

778
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:46,629
actually found this in my app that I

779
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:48,699
wrote let's refine about it we all make

780
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,859
mistakes I had a trust app thing in my

781
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,719
product that I wrote and I will take the

782
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,940
app name right and I'd put it in an XML

783
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,629
file but you actually can have I'll go

784
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:00,609
here is get through a couple here you

785
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:03,609
can have any value you want in the

786
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,679
version name of these pills so you

787
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,699
create your own blob in the middle of

788
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:09,429
them so my contact at Google about this

789
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:10,659
from a other response saying there was

790
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,279
no vulnerabilities in the Google

791
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,039
platform then they uh put at least a new

792
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,190
SDK where every fields being validated

793
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,099
now I think there's an issue there just

794
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,869
potentially also a while the stops you

795
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:27,249
from adding these these malicious tags

796
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:29,889
or things in using the vehicles plug-in

797
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,409
you can use anything else to add a field

798
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:34,869
into a binary xml file it's not voodoo

799
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,639
and just change your value of in hex

800
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:38,739
editor please these problems are

801
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,079
prevalent the same time they require

802
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,019
people to use it to use XML and you're

803
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,519
more vulnerable when people use their

804
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,259
own rocks ml so you can search for

805
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,269
things like you know like less than or

806
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,389
you look Eric XML mean they're building

807
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,029
from strengths which the typically the

808
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:56,739
API is will you know attempt to do some

809
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,779
sort of validation but um if you're

810
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,940
using a you know pull or satchel all

811
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,709
these things they don't you have to you

812
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,539
have to encode them and there's XML

813
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:05,829
encoders all over the place to encode

814
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:08,679
these things you can use package name

815
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,959
trust so this is a nightmare this is

816
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,399
really interesting so think about like

817
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,729
dns name swatting right so i can go by

818
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:18,940
com dot Bing to through 100 or calm down

819
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,009
Microsoft up in two in I can buy it if I

820
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,010
want to

821
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,040
put an app out there's no validation so

822
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,120
it's kind of DNS squatting where you

823
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,490
have people buying these things what

824
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,760
makes it more interesting is that um app

825
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,460
will trust these names furthermore

826
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,680
they'll trust name for one app on one

827
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,200
market all right we have like advanced

828
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,940
task layer which I'll talk about next

829
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,190
slide here they'll trust this here hero

830
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,650
led which is the fault LED driving that

831
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,030
comes to some phone samsung would not

832
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,740
they trust the package them they won't

833
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,560
show it in your process list right but

834
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,870
when vendors install apps they push you

835
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,160
down from the mobile vendor they don't

836
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,530
buy a spot in the marketplace and push

837
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,870
it out to subscribers it's on the phone

838
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,160
so they never actually by the name of

839
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,690
the package so I went and bought the

840
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,160
name on the package there's a nap right

841
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,780
now you can go on download that's named

842
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,430
the same package and if you look at the

843
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,380
task killer and all these process you

844
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,480
know based like a TAS protest managers

845
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,250
that you won't see my app isn't visible

846
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,130
because it's trusted right this whole

847
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,530
package Constance interesting um so

848
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,760
squatting and talk about that obviously

849
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,680
I can get the right now and buy every

850
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,360
very very microsoft talk to technology I

851
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,700
could think of alright and owned those

852
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,590
namespaces like a domain name and

853
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,630
there's no Terms of Service violation

854
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,400
anything like that creates kind of a

855
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,080
weird issue it goes in the planning

856
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,190
process now when you buy it up you have

857
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,690
to get that really like you are

858
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,620
going to build a website you buy the

859
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,090
domain I have to get that package so

860
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,110
keep in mind we get a package on one

861
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,600
market and a product russert you have

862
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,970
another 2,000 markets you also need to

863
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,340
go buy that package name on to the app

864
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,540
will be used on that market as one

865
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,920
people traveler they these mobile

866
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,260
markets web view chart reversal so the

867
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,180
models changed on mobile phones when you

868
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,350
think of cross-site scripting in those

869
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,300
things you get in the browser mobile

870
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,950
phones play so the web browser are

871
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,810
uniquely in their own apps we use

872
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,010
Facebook or Twitter all these things

873
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,570
you're not using the Android browser

874
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,390
using a web view inside it out so the

875
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,890
context of a most of you to the web

876
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,030
auditors know up security you have the

877
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,380
same origin policy and all those things

878
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,170
there's a different compartment for this

879
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,460
so if i attack the browser and then and

880
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,960
for facebook no one's ever use it or

881
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,190
logged in i can't get a cookie or use

882
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,530
SQL injection kind of cross scripting

883
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,830
kind of thing but there's a way to reach

884
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,990
out and

885
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,520
an act these are remote web views

886
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,590
there's features like the browsable

887
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,230
interface you have those humans windows

888
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,270
there's the URL monikers of protocol

889
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,429
handlers they call them we have lucky no

890
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:44,320
gopher colon slash slash or ftp colon

891
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,330
slash slash or all these things so they

892
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,309
create their own handlers like to say I

893
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:50,470
had one called HTTP x1 like when i click

894
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,210
that in a browser that will invoke the

895
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,240
app right to use is that and if I've

896
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,500
across that scripting bug now I can

897
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,809
exploit the apps too so now press the

898
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:01,240
scripting bugs are big on web browsers

899
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,890
but now I could push them to all mobile

900
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,780
phones as well and now it can also be

901
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,650
exploded apps and also csrf as an

902
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,290
example i have one here mm-hmm reckon

903
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,760
Apps Script recognize whatever I and

904
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,960
what else I want it'll be replayed

905
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,220
through the web view to the target site

906
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,050
using the authentication credentials

907
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,179
signed a nap and apps automatically log

908
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,340
in and sign up when it started so you

909
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,050
don't you don't lose that window anymore

910
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,610
when you're attacking across that

911
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,780
scripting of an app running in the

912
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,070
background you have a small time frame

913
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,260
right where I'll run and you hope you're

914
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,400
going to get that cooking get access to

915
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,220
it apps are there all the time so as

916
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,630
long as someone clicks that app at some

917
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,050
point at all a mobile phone so it

918
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,820
changes the attack surface with web

919
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,770
security check in my time there okay I'm

920
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,800
input which we talked about this you

921
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,059
know I tried everything those of you

922
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,710
that want Amanda mill set up I tried it

923
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,660
all there's a lot of solutions for me I

924
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,290
just gotta move to 64-bit pptp d might

925
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,090
be tables report redirect through /

926
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,410
products that's all that really work I

927
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,050
tried everything Mallory works in some

928
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,460
cases but it's more of a lesson iphone

929
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,320
solution this works for everything if

930
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,700
you guys want rules for that or set up i

931
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,020
have it set me an email to my email

932
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,520
address have to provide the whole setup

933
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,260
for your eyes burned an entire week on

934
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,360
this embarrassing to admit to get just

935
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,670
what i could see traffic plus thinks you

936
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,280
hate doing right so a tax services but

937
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,830
the browser attack surface is great all

938
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,559
the codes written native all the stuff

939
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,970
is up you know open source linux

940
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,340
libraries so you can just do a search

941
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,080
you like i call it like changelog

942
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,300
hacking it's really funny right go

943
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,830
through a big product you want how you

944
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,450
want to exploit you can just look at

945
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,820
their chain blogs the last build look at

946
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,559
the bugs they fixed let them do the work

947
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,710
for you ironically it's all open source

948
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,360
it's this benefits and is also dangerous

949
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,990
so moving on to some cool tricks a lot

950
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,340
of android apps can have this is

951
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,020
lockable feature with a check the log

952
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,150
level and the android app builder as

953
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,650
well you know that if it's the bugs i'll

954
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,480
write everything out so you guys can set

955
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,850
those log levels in the show and make it

956
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,860
all for bus now like a for example like

957
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,630
this with Twitter and every single

958
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,220
operation Twitter's word out to the blog

959
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,890
you're testing it's nice little trick to

960
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,480
auditing apps turn all of the buggy

961
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,740
guess if it was a debug engineering

962
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,590
build its rotation this is pretty cool

963
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,530
as well so you can use apktool and you

964
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,120
can decompile an app and you can build

965
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,940
an engineer your own code in so say

966
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,960
you're doing the man the middle attack

967
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,390
on you know the marketplace out but it's

968
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,430
going to fail ssl cert validation so you

969
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,170
can't see the middle of traffic but you

970
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,330
can build in your own code to

971
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,100
automatically accept certs you override

972
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,500
certain methods and java so you can

973
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,220
ensure it all sorts of cool stuff

974
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,530
buzzing frameworks you name it your own

975
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,450
code auditing dynamic analysis you can

976
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,240
build it in then recompile it's real

977
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,590
interesting way because Java allows us

978
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,480
to do that you can do that and see you

979
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,680
know i'll play around with python all

980
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,760
these languages and the hooking

981
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,890
libraries do these things and job it's

982
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,390
it's so much more simplistic you can

983
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,540
rewrite the entire thing and add your

984
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,890
your attack service or your your attack

985
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,470
it into the app I just haven't run and

986
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,650
island itself okay android now going to

987
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,330
security hole so we're all past the song

988
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,370
and dance and be feeling about android

989
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,719
the random crap that i came up with this

990
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,250
is what the presentation is pretty much

991
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,480
about fall beyond it the reason you're

992
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,190
here sale the cool security olds we

993
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,000
found so live blog the blogging service

994
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,810
nandroid the path / dev / log all

995
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,520
devices are world writable i can

996
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,889
arbitrarily right locks lock at Jesus

997
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,300
lip log does anything else parsing logs

998
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,380
law cat has lost security holes in it

999
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,110
several doesn't he voter flows right so

1000
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,540
any app that uses law CAD like pretty

1001
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,850
much every antivirus product is

1002
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,350
vulnerable heap overflow because it's

1003
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,429
running in the context of the app also

1004
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,659
anything anything else use this lock app

1005
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,820
for example now logs can also be written

1006
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,560
remotely to say like when you start

1007
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,989
starter browser you put out the URL you

1008
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:56,260
know

1009
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,580
code things there and trigger the same

1010
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,400
issue the buds that we found her in the

1011
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,740
same exact location as a reporter

1012
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,870
previously and what we're going to pose

1013
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,190
more details once we've kind of got the

1014
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,600
okay from the rest of vendors that are

1015
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,130
affected by this or maybe the following

1016
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,620
week that's the nightmare and it when

1017
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,510
you get deep down into my call intern

1018
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,820
code right the core security features

1019
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,440
are written by the veterans and you have

1020
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,790
all the extra stuff you guys just rate

1021
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,990
rush to mark and get done you have the

1022
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,190
intern code this is in terms of

1023
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,930
definitely probably pissing somebody off

1024
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,210
that here's not but it is it I mean it's

1025
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,210
all basic 1995 security holes string

1026
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,850
copy string cat no link checking things

1027
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,410
in any modern compiler will throw a

1028
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,030
warnings off left and right if you build

1029
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,160
code you don't have warnings not hard to

1030
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,830
fix right about being a good developer

1031
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,270
so tombstones this is the addenda

1032
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,400
developer friendly version of a core

1033
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,100
dump their textual representations of a

1034
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,230
fault here for example if you see this

1035
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,700
when you're auditing Android software

1036
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,100
what that indicates an Android

1037
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,930
internally when there's a heap failure a

1038
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,730
corruption you're not going to get up

1039
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,560
you know failure to access a forward or

1040
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,070
a backlink alright with heap solved

1041
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,960
coalesce blocks and when they move it or

1042
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,890
coalesce with these things you'll see

1043
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,360
these errors and forward and back links

1044
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,340
and Android as soon as they do one of

1045
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,360
these checks but through on the board

1046
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,910
which will throw a pointer a read error

1047
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,100
on dead bad so when you see that you get

1048
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,900
something pretty good that means you had

1049
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,980
a heap corruption or something should

1050
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:23,080
write SQL injection so it's a problem

1051
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,150
it's also a problem in the android

1052
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,810
framework okay SQL query builder and

1053
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,820
truly district catenation for everything

1054
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,890
you know you think you're building safer

1055
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,210
query is this all spring catenation in

1056
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,540
the end and furthermore the query and

1057
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,400
mayonnaise query api's which is used by

1058
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,020
pretty much everything out there content

1059
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,120
writers all the stuff use these they

1060
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,890
have these arguments for where an order

1061
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,800
by we can do aware you know x equals

1062
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,750
this or x equals that you know by vice

1063
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,480
versa those are using internally query

1064
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,700
builder so you can put in your entire

1065
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,040
SQL coiling delimited naive SQL

1066
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,480
injection and safe sks be all aps

1067
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,560
mobile vendor issues so just in case and

1068
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,030
Travis that cart recently just talked

1069
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,710
about this HTC wrote an app to go out

1070
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,720
and gather all this information right I

1071
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,240
thought about mobile platforms about the

1072
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,590
other apps wearing the Machine the

1073
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,420
account access from google all these

1074
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,950
services email addresses phone numbers

1075
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,020
all the stuff they throw it locally but

1076
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,330
then it's world readable so it's the

1077
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,740
same thing with vendors we call I call

1078
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,940
it crap where it's been called crap

1079
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,560
where you go buy a new laptop and you

1080
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,650
have 40 applique for tea tray icons it's

1081
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,090
a vendor at vendor event of negotiation

1082
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,859
now vendors are changing their stance

1083
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:35,810
where they're saying like Microsoft for

1084
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,430
example is gone and said hey we'll give

1085
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,420
you support for your new motorola

1086
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,760
drivers or Samsung but we don't want

1087
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,040
this crap install your software will

1088
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,180
work better we have default driver

1089
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,100
support so that's changing but now it's

1090
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,170
back in mobile again if you buy a phone

1091
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,119
you have all these annoying apps you

1092
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,580
can't install that verizon people will

1093
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,990
put it a blockbuster i don't care about

1094
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,609
blockbuster if you can't remove it it's

1095
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,200
there every time you open up you have

1096
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,060
these apps so we're back to cracker but

1097
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,680
now we're on the mobile phone and these

1098
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,740
things are likely vulnerable to then

1099
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,150
what you can't install install it what

1100
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,520
do you do they forced offer on your

1101
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,720
phone you can't remove its vulnerable

1102
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,470
potentially or lease obnoxious right

1103
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,440
excuse me so motorola blur their

1104
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,680
framework their updates or over 0 off

1105
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,000
they're all unencrypted so have fun with

1106
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,060
that I guess I'm sort of sniff out an

1107
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,950
android phone or iphone and salsa maps

1108
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,350
so much is unencrypted cookies and

1109
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,160
session IDs all these things are

1110
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,640
encrypted goes back to the whole thing

1111
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,250
so again the holy grail of mobile phone

1112
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,290
exploits probably my favorite part of

1113
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,330
this whole thing right my big slap in

1114
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,530
the face all the reporters they gave us

1115
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,690
a bunch of grief promote app installs

1116
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,790
right to be able to reach out pick a

1117
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,290
phone number i can install an app on the

1118
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,140
phone right all stealth so the good

1119
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,540
stuff is most the most series of the

1120
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,840
threats that an example here so google

1121
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,180
account looking blinking so no in my

1122
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:03,320
obnoxious videos so I chrome default vm

1123
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,240
nothing else installed i'm going to go

1124
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,510
and open up and clear all the data no

1125
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,340
it's the beginning of time everything is

1126
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,330
cleared no session information

1127
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,330
whatsoever now i'm gonna go log into

1128
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,310
some ram google search

1129
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,250
here I'm a locking the docs right from

1130
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,620
my dummy account I'll just kills me

1131
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,000
every time I see it good stuff

1132
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,880
close your eyes

1133
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,020
okay now we're in dots we're logged in

1134
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,260
now we're going to go to the marketplace

1135
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,670
in android so watch what happens this is

1136
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,710
interesting those of you familiar with

1137
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,240
Google will probably can predict what's

1138
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,190
going to happen those of you or now will

1139
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:56,180
probably be a really concerned I'm looks

1140
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:05,150
like sign in I'm just signed in film I

1141
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,580
mulliken this mobile account now and now

1142
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,690
I'm going to go and install an app in a

1143
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,450
phone so if you think about that hmm

1144
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,420
what does that mean that means that any

1145
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,100
low these google services if they have

1146
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,660
one cross-site scripting bug or one

1147
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,760
problem you can compromise that not only

1148
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,620
take over every Google account but also

1149
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,040
one solid app to the phone right that's

1150
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,430
a pretty big attack surface don't be

1151
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,570
getting angry phone calls about that

1152
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,210
later I'm sure so know what you're

1153
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,830
thinking right they're pretty good about

1154
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,590
haunting their services cookies are HT

1155
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,360
only and secure you know you can't check

1156
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,360
them but unfortunately in things like

1157
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,730
sort of calm bucks right there could be

1158
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,350
an all tificate and now everything's

1159
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,330
validated zero you know I say you're one

1160
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,860
know by the way from having your phone

1161
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,450
rooted hey thanks for certificate

1162
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,640
validation with to worry about it on my

1163
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,460
way here I was in Frisco and I got on my

1164
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,290
phone I you know hypothetically set up

1165
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,730
an example where I may have manned the

1166
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,950
middle hypothetically speaking you know

1167
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,470
to to go and pose as a gmail service

1168
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,840
right and I walk up the starbucks and I

1169
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,430
say you know keeping certificate

1170
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,770
warnings about the domain name doesn't

1171
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,300
match the target or something what

1172
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,620
should I do is I go they get those all

1173
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,310
the time just the continued okay same

1174
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,600
thing in my second Airport which I won't

1175
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,100
name because they're a little bit more

1176
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,200
ruthless walked up to a place where i

1177
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,700
bought a cup of coffee and seafood the

1178
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,290
same place which kind of threw me off I

1179
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,180
asked her and that's when they're she's

1180
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,130
like I don't know it she's like I would

1181
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,170
just click continue I feel like the

1182
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,550
consumer issue right there's always

1183
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,150
crazy attacks on mandolin ssl but to be

1184
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,730
honest it's three clicks away because if

1185
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,900
we wants to check their email there on

1186
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,390
the way to work not security

1187
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,980
professionals that's the whole thing I'm

1188
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,960
trying to push here it is not charging

1189
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,430
security people retire her getting

1190
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,819
consumed

1191
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:51,529
okay there's a whole different thought

1192
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:54,109
processor their loved ones of people we

1193
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,339
know that don't have any idea what's

1194
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,630
going on they want to use their stuff

1195
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,489
right they want to click their button

1196
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:01,959
use their stuff what they want so

1197
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,759
hypothetically speaking I may have

1198
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:07,279
written app that I deployed using a

1199
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,099
hypothetical proxy burp and in an

1200
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:12,650
airport somewhere in the world and I

1201
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,630
send them in the app may have sent this

1202
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,849
instead of I wish your vendor would you

1203
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:19,130
know invalidate the security of apps but

1204
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,949
before providing them to you there was a

1205
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:29,089
man for that of course Steve Jobs okay

1206
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:31,519
um conclusion exercise caution when

1207
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,920
installing apps avoid a free Wi-Fi at

1208
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,440
all costs laptops the software's more

1209
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,699
up-to-date you're not going to have

1210
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:39,680
third text communications as much we're

1211
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,359
in those guys for ages about that but

1212
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,039
mobile software is different keep going

1213
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:44,869
back the same thing consumer develop

1214
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:48,529
software for consumers okay consider

1215
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:50,539
installing up it's not a shameless plug

1216
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:52,549
it's actually a good idea it's all the

1217
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:54,680
mobile security up of some sort at least

1218
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,209
to validate some of these things I mean

1219
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,499
we maybe we'll only have a handful of

1220
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,660
our on the US market but you get to age

1221
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,709
of this different out here there's a lot

1222
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:02,719
more malware a lot of people try to make

1223
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,910
a fast buck let's go to have ceased do a

1224
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,499
basic mp5 check to look at these apps

1225
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:08,900
doesn't hurt take it by antivirus you

1226
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,759
know with a junior security

1227
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:13,279
professionals the complaint of how

1228
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,519
something doesn't work how horses is but

1229
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,440
if it solves a chunk of the problem it's

1230
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,199
got value it's a pessimistic view right

1231
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,539
if it if it gives you thirty percent

1232
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:26,479
more protection and it's free and 1 i'll

1233
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:32,359
use it to be honest again the consumers

1234
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,469
don't have the budget to hire screw

1235
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:34,969
professionals we fill out a hundred

1236
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,609
dollars an hour to an alarm our 250-300

1237
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:39,380
colors so much a guy your wedding his

1238
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,699
first app is not going to spend five or

1239
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:42,979
ten thousand dollars on his app it's not

1240
00:43:42,979 --> 00:43:44,299
going to happen he want to get out there

1241
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:47,839
and get it published and marketplace

1242
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,819
operators don't currently perform phone

1243
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:52,039
Belize guessed Apple does that's why my

1244
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,719
little plug / steve jobs are they

1245
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,789
actually perform validation then i am

1246
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:57,949
i'm not a big apple person when it comes

1247
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,150
the way they develop the marketplace

1248
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,069
today at the right where i can only

1249
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:03,440
theorize the reason that the android

1250
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:03,710
mark

1251
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,570
place has done the way it is is to catch

1252
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,690
up an appt counts its they pull out all

1253
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,790
the bottlenecks and I think what's they

1254
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,530
get to where they're neck and neck you

1255
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,480
might see some more some more features

1256
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,530
there where you can validate these

1257
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,520
things only thing I can figure out

1258
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,869
because I I know a lot of the guys in

1259
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:20,150
those teams are brilliant guys over over

1260
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,440
google and if they wanted they could

1261
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,050
they could walk this down there's got to

1262
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,190
be a reason I can't figure out what it

1263
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,830
is questions and comments that's

1264
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:36,770
fantastic that's that's even better I'm

1265
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:39,710
tired and I was terrified and everybody

1266
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,940
asking it was complicated questions I

1267
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,359
couldn't answer right now alright we can

1268
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:45,320
finally I'll be mingling around

1269
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,420
somewhere half awake well hey thank you

1270
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,890
for attending I appreciate it if you

1271
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,819
have any questions I'll be around
