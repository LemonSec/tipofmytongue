the second is a convenient system which

basically a radio relay station in orbit

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,860
incredible

a fixed position and it will maintain

near on his villa la fraise with like

75
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,370
three or four lights so this would be

[Music]

170
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,700
you see a fake process so it's tricky to

171
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,740
actually exploit it and then they have

172
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,260
EMR extended services which is like

173
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,290
single octave from terminal to arena in

174
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,560
order to avoid large delay because we do

175
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,280
the satellite associated with the double

176
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,880
satellite hope from mobile terminology

177
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,360
to another mobile terminal calls us

178
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,540
satellite and they have like Optima

179
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:17,020
protein that terminal calls to be to be

180
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,840
routed in a station different than the

181
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,880
regular gateway station which that

182
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,510
serving our registers and also high

183
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,720
penetration our team where the system

184
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,720
will allow subscribers to be page even

185
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,169
when the terminal is normally rates area

186
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:46,990
and position based services it's using

187
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,480
the GPS system they will provide for

188
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,090
information on the humor one user

189
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,039
terminal then we have PR - it's quite

190
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,380
similar with humor one except you

191
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,820
provide more flexibility on the data

192
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,230
surfaces and the connectivity of the GMR

193
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,690
- it's provided by the supplied and

194
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,690
fixed run equipment whose main elements

195
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,260
are gateway and network control sensors

196
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:22,799
so yeah the system elements it will have

197
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,120
a network control sensor and then the

198
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,210
customer management information center

199
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,800
numbers of the airways and house

200
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,790
[Music]

201
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,000
each year we will connect to the PSTN or

202
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,630
Frankfurt network or public plan mobile

203
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:53,640
networks and gimr to use seven feeder

204
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,160
linking for communication between the

205
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,650
satellite and the one equipment for

206
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,260
example here in in bottom yes

207
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,809
supply control center there acting as a

208
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:12,360
gateway as well and here's the alguns

209
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,440
column for the customer and it will as

210
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
we can see serves the same average

211
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,420
[Applause]

212
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,510
and

213
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,129
and

214
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,630
yes

215
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,380
if for example like here yes ceasing but

216
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,830
in in China Sea from Japan waiting in

217
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,320
munition fishing both this transaction

218
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,490
over the sea for the access cetera or

219
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,059
maybe drug lords in the patriarch of

220
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,740
Thailand Cambodia or maybe Vietnam

221
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,520
they are the main user of the satellite

222
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,940
map on his area because

223
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,160
on the land out on the terrain basically

224
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,430
we comfort with the trees and younger

225
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,720
and and since the system requires clear

226
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,700
of sight between the house to the

227
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:33,010
suffice it won't work if if you use in

228
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,970
103 or under the building of like third

229
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,270
year

230
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,540
from the functional point of view the

231
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,940
give way implements some stuff like

232
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,650
radio modem function of the terrestrial

233
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:58,890
BTSs we can say that and it has like

234
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,460
radio resource management function of

235
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,120
BSC and switching switching function of

236
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,850
MSC so basically any GSM operator can

237
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,970
also explain it to the cell phone

238
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,440
operator just by X anywhere a five-piece

239
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,560
part to the vehicle access

240
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,200
next we talk about the GMR supply

241
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,030
monitoring system or many of us always

242
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,360
interpret the word monitoring with in

243
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,980
the surfing

244
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:45,299
so why satellite phone interception it's

245
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:50,909
as many reasons as bigger excuses law

246
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:53,929
enforcement requires

247
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,340
they put some sort of like law

248
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,210
enforcement device on in the way try to

249
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,500
use this almost everything through the

250
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,760
network and also we can we can do

251
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,679
intersection on the best equipment

252
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,309
because it has the most most of time and

253
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:24,630
also limit the use of encryption as we

254
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,880
go as I said earlier the encryption

255
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,590
Wi-Fi so let's see if you supported the

256
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,320
data or the contact while the white one

257
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,700
it's only used for the portability and

258
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,390
also we can do intersection on what if

259
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,230
you have the fun equipment I think last

260
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,799
year so now made a presentation about

261
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,580
the GSM is living using

262
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,580
for the brand Siemens see something

263
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,090
Morial

264
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,600
in order to see success to do like

265
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,929
interception we can using practical

266
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:16,040
interception that will receive album

267
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,168
from the satellite and

268
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,320
from the line of side of the handset and

269
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,739
also strategic interception receives

270
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,510
album from the satellite and thus even

271
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:37,560
from so this is like the typical offset

272
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,110
interception or phrase of operation

273
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:46,190
there's a gateway there's an help lions

274
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,350
the communication between the satellite

275
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,310
and the terminal or both are station or

276
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,489
a handset it's effective using frequency

277
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:59,580
L pen it's around one point six years

278
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,560
and one point five yards for the

279
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,120
offering and downlink frequency

280
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,120
respectively and primary gateway station

281
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,770
provides connection to the first three

282
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:17,430
or communication for example a PSTN it

283
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,230
has like 60 gigahertz and feed yards for

284
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,180
the opinion and running this gateway

285
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,180
also as a satellite operation sensor it

286
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,500
will provide all the tracking telemetry

287
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,510
common function for this flight as well

288
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:43,080
as its opening weekend so since this use

289
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,350
number of squat beams for the

290
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,720
communication with the handheld our end

291
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,820
user or vasquez which can be combined

292
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,910
and we can see here from the Tron

293
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,150
[Music]

294
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:07,820
it's right there it's the network use

295
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:13,750
GPS position provided by the mass and

296
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,690
we'll record to the gateway in order to

297
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,560
get to the parks spot view however for

298
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,990
security reasons

299
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,500
this is I heard from the

300
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,730
from the technical documentation higher

301
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,390
the accuracy of the GPS position is very

302
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,440
greatly limited to run hundred meter so

303
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,980
I don't know if it's for the real

304
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:47,410
security reason or maybe I don't know I

305
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,590
mean like you can nearly provide here

306
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,520
correct

307
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,510
GPS position still not sure why the

308
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,210
satellite operator can't provide the

309
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,540
accuracy of the GPS position for the

310
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,849
clients

311
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,670
maybe they afraid the client would be a

312
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,579
target target for broadcasts I don't

313
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:18,509
know so the first method is in tactical

314
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,239
satellite operation meaning that you

315
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,690
will have some sort of equipment mobile

316
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,989
equipment they do monitoring of the

317
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,739
satellite stream limited to one find

318
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,539
five figures because you are not fine

319
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,779
and you have to be near the target or

320
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:46,539
taken basically anywhere death radio and

321
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:52,449
off-site so see is this monitoring

322
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,559
system it's basically done by some

323
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,169
operational team on the ground providing

324
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:02,849
the real find intercepts for the handset

325
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:08,819
user or the local presence sensor and

326
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,469
this system is portable and can be

327
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,769
rapidly assembled and moved to another

328
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:21,869
area it's relatively cheap and it's a

329
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:26,889
good choice of intercepting or

330
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:31,719
monitoring location that use one antenna

331
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,839
masts and it will provide great friends

332
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:38,130
the handset uplink signal which says

333
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:43,070
line-of-sight to define

334
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,960
and it's usually operated on very into

335
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,799
Asians buddies or military

336
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:58,309
and he has this is the

337
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,940
simple version of the

338
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,740
equipment yes antenna and the a big

339
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,230
antenna on the different channels this

340
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,690
down comforter with the intermediate

341
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,440
frequency that will carry the sign is

342
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,710
shift some intermediate steps you in

343
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:37,230
transmission and reception Venus 14

344
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:42,119
frequency if impression calls mess MC

345
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,839
gears coordinates and excess rise and

346
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,569
also encryption algorithm

347
00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:00,719
and then this strategic one mainly use

348
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,469
to monitor like specific oppressor it

349
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,759
will like passively intercept Donley's

350
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:13,929
from the satellite see bands on the life

351
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:16,979
itself see Ben and

352
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,850
of the clients it's on the right and the

353
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:27,730
setup is it's similar like a gateway but

354
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:34,390
doing passively monitor the senior setup

355
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,640
is just like having a result as on one

356
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,790
my previous public demonstration if you

357
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:50,670
hear a cue years ago so this strategy

358
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,430
intersection operation will provide

359
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,880
continual live operation monitoring of

360
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,960
the handset of the users and all the

361
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:16,500
voice SMS recorded sport in you can use

362
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,280
one system may be interface for battery

363
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,640
recording center for analysis or maybe

364
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,290
transcription so

365
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,160
the typical C Bendis it can be used for

366
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,460
the money for insane prices under seven

367
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,650
to nine meters that can receive the C

368
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:47,539
been the only okay we have 15 min laughs

369
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:54,410
I'm not supposed to do a demo first

370
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,830
it's not good

371
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:05,360
it's not true second problem with some

372
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:11,110
oppressor because I find some some ideas

373
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,720
because of the in order to to get the

374
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,820
knowledge of the circuit system they are

375
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,070
several ways to the area you can go

376
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,330
through all the buttons or you can talk

377
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:33,140
to except for you because rarely of them

378
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,520
will hot and give the detail or you can

379
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,050
hack it

380
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,340
haiku system are doing consulting for

381
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,500
them and it was shared some of the noise

382
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:51,280
and I was all to the last one

383
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,030
if will we that we profound there's no

384
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,000
demo in this talk

385
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,800
everybody needs from agreed there's no

386
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,340
limo I will play

387
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,489
[Music]

388
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,670
okay you didn't see anything that's

389
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,170
great since I get your football I'll

390
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,610
show you this is some sort of the system

391
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:30,560
I cannot say we it's monitoring started

392
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,230
strategy monitoring system method cover

393
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,290
our specific compressor I could name the

394
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,600
name so basically you can read the SMS

395
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,150
as you can see it says it's onion

396
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,680
Harvick

397
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,569
come on don't take a picture come on you

398
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,740
leave me no choice

399
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:58,339
I can't be jobless next plan and then we

400
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:04,700
can also for recall voice I cannot play

401
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:14,288
the audio anyway yes the conversation

402
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,590
and as we can see the information that

403
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,890
we can get from this particular set of

404
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,560
this numbers dates

405
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,359
raishin calls or time the communication

406
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:41,310
happens tips information and a number of

407
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,050
our color I leave this our ID MC but

408
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:54,500
only the last few digits in a Radian if

409
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:00,330
in activating some code location there

410
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:07,460
for sure so

411
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:10,870
this again

412
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:14,130
the original idea is only for monitoring

413
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:20,280
but it happened to the intersection for

414
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,690
Y and this is like maybe you some some

415
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,880
guys in Afghanistan some terrorists

416
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,180
[Applause]

417
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:39,190
anyway so basically by doing passive

418
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,840
monitoring we can hold all the

419
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,360
information and they're done by the

420
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,920
clients in specific regions see

421
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,589
[Music]

422
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:53,880
okay so

423
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:59,230
as I understand in Asia during the

424
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,540
thought usually there is less question

425
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,900
in the end of the talk so we tend to

426
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,180
think it might be business aside to

427
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,640
start a new trend let's make a

428
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,730
frequently asked question

429
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:20,140
so the normal or the useful question is

430
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,030
the technique is operator specific the

431
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,090
answer is yes and no for example like

432
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:30,160
some operator as I said earlier in

433
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,800
Marcel and SS it's their shared sign

434
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,980
technology so any interception against

435
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,760
SS will also apply to in Martha good in

436
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,930
this case only goes to that similarity

437
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,230
what about the Leo supply phone system

438
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,810
like Louis R or iridium it's possible

439
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:59,440
only for practical monetary why because

440
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,020
of the lately own nature of the system

441
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,080
the orbit is too low so any monitoring

442
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,650
center it's not it won't cover the whole

443
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,630
area and last night

444
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,090
this is interesting discussion about the

445
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,100
one security issue it's I happened to

446
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,980
grow up by Benjamin runs one of the

447
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:33,670
speaker since electro they release the

448
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,220
windows mobile satellite and health

449
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,840
windows smartphone so we get the thing

450
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,510
like it might cause the girls to do like

451
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,710
what was the government agency or

452
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,800
hackers to you in the normal GSM and

453
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,530
health I believe since they are like I

454
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,160
was traveling the user won't have time

455
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,650
to actually update a software if my

456
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,830
easier cause they know not for us but

457
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,980
for this government agency is you can

458
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,540
like Trojan horse or

459
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:19,609
taking the climate's and what about

460
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:21,630
encryption

461
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,830
that's really interesting because here

462
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:30,120
are one or two is based on GSM now I

463
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,730
start asking question it is still driven

464
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:37,950
yes and this secure was like something

465
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:42,450
like since this is very basic I'm trying

466
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:47,660
to use to expand my recess so I can

467
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,760
I will suggest you to visit this project

468
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,610
for customer from GM are done very

469
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,610
interesting stuff in the past few years

470
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:08,500
related with the GS and extra radio and

471
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,640
now I think start in September of

472
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,560
birthday we can talk about or maybe

473
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,320
doing some project on satellite mogul

474
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,030
system

475
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:29,050
and in this website you can also learn

476
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:35,530
how to receive the satellite mobile

477
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,300
system packets and Cosmo yes GMR

478
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,890
software so if you want to build your

479
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:51,640
own practical in the second system you

480
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,750
can start from here and again Toraja is

481
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:59,560
the famous for this because it's what we

482
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:04,570
used realistic click you and they have

483
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,790
many users

484
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,400
speaking about the yes I'm a nutrition

485
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,400
last year from now and different Munoz

486
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,190
they were presenting the Y 20s and

487
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,550
sleeping at 22nd CCC basically you're

488
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,330
running series of fun running modified

489
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,120
of smoke on BB as the DSM packet sniffer

490
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:38,230
and since the GSM a 5-1 and Christian

491
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,790
can be quite in seconds the complexity

492
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,140
the wireless phone is looking both to

493
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:53,130
the signal processing and and I believe

494
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:56,830
some initiative already take a look on

495
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:01,980
the how our implementation

496
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,310
on this encryption algorithms and

497
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,900
interesting notice like for the case

498
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,380
this cellular industry comprised the

499
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,380
cellphones chip maker and metal

500
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,809
compressor they give their hardware and

501
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:23,890
system level software as well as GSM

502
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,249
protocol type increments in close I can

503
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:30,549
tell you this it's not only GSM all the

504
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:34,690
GMR technology implementation also

505
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,450
closed today is why I said here so at

506
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:40,119
least for option for you in order to

507
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:42,249
understand this a quite fun system how

508
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,759
it works is header you become part of

509
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:50,470
them work with them or you can start at

510
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,339
a hard working as a consultant so I

511
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:57,670
think that's the end of my presentation

512
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:03,329
today I do have this satellite specific

513
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,759
RAF can can be an interesting subject

514
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:10,869
for you factors our general public start

515
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:15,249
looking at this technology because maybe

516
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:18,369
it's almost forgotten not many people

517
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:21,990
remember we have satellite

518
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,790
we do have satellite phones

519
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:32,230
so yeah that's you know it so I hope

520
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:38,730
this beer questions no questions good

521
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,770
thank you all right thank you so much

522
