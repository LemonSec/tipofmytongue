1
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,040
microphone on thanks good morning thank

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,290
you for having me I'm so pleased to be

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,560
here it is really nice okay well I'll

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,869
get right into it so all of us

5
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,980
understand I think that we're really on

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,180
one of those turning points in history

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,840
right I mean when they write books in

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,350
the future about where we are today it

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,850
is going to be big and you know the two

10
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,150
events happened in 2010 which really

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,330
highlighted the implications for

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,910
national security as well as for many

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,170
other things of cyber cyber security

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,620
cyber attacks cyber defense and we're

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,730
going to look at them today which is

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,030
WikiLeaks and Stuxnet so I tried to

17
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,600
frame it in you know in a way that we

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,439
could look at it from a historical

19
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,920
perspective could you turn on the

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,300
counter so I could see the time and so

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,900
what we're looking at is an old adage

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,110
right in fact old adage is redundant the

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,780
adage means that it's it's time honored

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,190
wisdom yeah and so it's something that

25
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,290
has been handed down to us for four

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,280
centuries that comes to be accepted as

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,110
truth and so these are some characters

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,830
from history Euripides on the top left

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,049
so said that the tongue is mightier than

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,020
the blade Muhammad talked about how the

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,680
ink of the scholar is mightier or

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,090
stronger than the blood of the martyr

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,350
Napoleon said that for hostile

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,729
newspapers are more to be feared than

35
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,038
thousand bayonets Thomas Jefferson in

36
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,408
our country said that you should do in

37
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,689
the future with the pen what people used

38
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,890
to do with the sword Shakespeare said

39
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,239
that those who carry rapiers or swords

40
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,189
sometimes fear those with goose quills

41
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,800
or pins more more than anything else

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,660
and then st. Paul there in the middle he

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,700
said that the Word of God is so powerful

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,070
that it even splits the soul and the

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,060
spirit right so so all that to say that

46
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,770
there's a lot coming down to us saying

47
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,260
that words are more powerful than

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,370
weapons and what I want to do is use

49
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,340
that as sort of as a tool through which

50
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,710
we could look at cyber security and

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,950
what's going on around us today I press

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,920
the button on the machine so the

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,870
information revolution obviously all of

54
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,740
those gentlemen lived before computers

55
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,410
right a computers have changed

56
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,870
everything so on the top left we have

57
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,080
the difference engine of Charles Babbage

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,770
that was designed in 1837 and wasn't

59
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,760
even built until nineteen ninety-one

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,240
right because it was so far ahead of its

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,050
time so mechanical calculator that in

62
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,920
fact is more powerful than the average

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,790
electronic calculator that you buy today

64
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,290
in a store on the right the ENIAC or the

65
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,530
electrical electric numerical integrator

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,380
and calculator which was built in World

67
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,209
War two to calculate military firing

68
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,680
tables and the univac just after it

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,880
after World War Two with just one

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,380
percent sample of the American

71
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,720
population correctly predicted the the

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,790
u.s. presidential election after the war

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,709
so so quickly it was seeing that

74
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,209
information technology is going to take

75
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,510
us to a new level now the development of

76
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,150
the personal computer of course puts all

77
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,670
of this power in your hands and in my

78
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,970
hands so PC is a serious research and

79
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,340
development generator right an idea

80
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,090
generator a game changer and each of us

81
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,780
now can own one for pretty cheap but

82
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,450
even that was blown away by connecting

83
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,390
all these things together right you put

84
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,990
all these things together

85
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,970
you've got a big global brain that we

86
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,630
can all tap into now and really

87
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,070
processing power you're you're you know

88
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,630
all those things you used to worry about

89
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,360
when you bought a machine are much less

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,540
important today then the reliability of

91
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,910
your internet connection that's the key

92
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,960
thing right you want a good unfiltered

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,190
reliable connection to the internet in

94
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,220
order to guarantee your your your place

95
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,860
in history and your in your opportunity

96
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,690
to affect history even right and so what

97
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,040
I want to think about also from the

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,330
standpoint of the internet being

99
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,790
everywhere is its amplification power

100
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,410
and the fact that you know you can push

101
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,950
things out as far on the planet and you

102
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,920
can reach out and touch things via the

103
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,840
internet and it has implications for

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,480
everything including weapons how we are

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,350
we sort of attack people you know is the

106
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,390
rockets and airplanes you know they

107
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,030
cross national borders and that was

108
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,710
after artillery you know could jump over

109
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,550
the the front line of battle and then

110
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,750
intercontinental ballistic missiles can

111
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,050
go anywhere on planet earth you know but

112
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,970
now you have the internet sort of allows

113
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,890
you to reach out and touch anywhere on

114
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,750
the globe it is internet connected and

115
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,960
really that's just about everywhere

116
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,570
today so from a historical perspective

117
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,750
you can imagine that anybody from a

118
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,770
student to a soldier a spy a politician

119
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,260
etc I mean they have enormous power in

120
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,640
their hands simply by reaching out and

121
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,440
speaking to or manipulating a smaller

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,390
audience a bigger audience and you can

123
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,220
imagine a propagandist today has the

124
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,940
power to put their story in everyone's

125
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,000
living room today and also this means

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
that even the smallest person on the

127
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
planet can ruin the day of a president

128
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,870
or prime minister right simply by

129
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,020
telling a story that is contradictory to

130
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,650
line or two a what what was you know the

131
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,800
the goal of a particular mission or a

132
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,210
war even so I want to tie this into

133
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,979
current events this is sort of my thing

134
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,930
I I feel like you know you always need

135
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,430
to tie these things into current events

136
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,440
to make them relevant in and see how in

137
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,580
fact real world is being as affecting

138
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,460
and being affected by all of these cyber

139
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,849
and cyber security affairs so Syria as

140
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,060
you know today is undergoing a well

141
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,400
they're in the middle of a revolution

142
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,710
say so so we're watching a transpire on

143
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,630
a daily basis and and that this is not

144
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,900
new so in nineteen eighty-two there was

145
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,909
also an uprising in the city called hema

146
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,930
and these are from two books from Beirut

147
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,509
to Jerusalem by Thomas Friedman and pity

148
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,250
the nation by robert fisk and these two

149
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,979
quotes but basically you know no one was

150
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,180
around in 1982 but the inhabitants of

151
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,219
hamlet to see what happened right so the

152
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,650
government came in and killed in up to

153
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,650
40,000 people you know leveled the town

154
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,750
i was there in 1988 so I visited Syria

155
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,479
and just really grew to love it and you

156
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,979
know there's no more friendlier people

157
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,319
or better food in the world and as I'm

158
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,270
walking down the main street in him and

159
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,770
this guy comes up to me and he walks

160
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,389
alongside me and he's looking at the

161
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,430
ground and he's talking he's telling me

162
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,080
everything that happened in nineteen

163
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,419
eighty-two you know how many people they

164
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,099
killed and what happened in the story

165
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,479
and so and so forth as we're walking

166
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,349
along for Pierre obviously of being

167
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,490
arrested so it's so different in 2011

168
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,260
all you have to do is go to youtube and

169
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,679
and to to search and you find no end of

170
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,979
evidence for what's going on today now

171
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,339
from a historical perspective this is it

172
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,149
couldn't be bigger because the hope for

173
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,079
all of us should be that that this

174
00:08:54,079 --> 00:09:00,390
technology to record and to not only you

175
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,450
know amplify what's what's happening

176
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,450
on the ground but also to pull back

177
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,330
what's happening from anywhere else on

178
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,760
the globe these are the push and pull of

179
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,140
the internet you know you can contribute

180
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,810
to and take from it hopefully will lead

181
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,820
to more transparency accountability of

182
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,500
government so and so forth and we're

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,660
really witnessing that I think in Syria

184
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,529
today now in Syria today so YouTube

185
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,560
Twitter and Facebook basically those

186
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,670
pages are available for Syrian citizens

187
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,020
to go to but anything with a secure

188
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,560
login is not so you can search for

189
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,270
videos right now on YouTube but you

190
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,250
can't watch them for instance or you

191
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,400
can't login to twitter so that was an

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,400
example of the pain of the WikiLeaks say

193
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,740
and in the ability to tell a story or

194
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,670
two to read a story now when you think

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,440
about weapons and military targeting and

196
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,320
military destruction and so on so forth

197
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,150
for a long time the United States

198
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,530
there's been this question about whether

199
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,190
an electronic or digital Pearl Harbor is

200
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,880
even theoretically possible but I I

201
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,089
suspect that we've already had numerous

202
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,830
electronic pro harbors it's just that

203
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,290
you know they they look different and

204
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,690
they feel different and and you may not

205
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,520
know it for a while so this in 2007 you

206
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,180
can see the alleged nuclear reactor in

207
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,370
Syria that they were building

208
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,640
clandestinely you know it was there one

209
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,530
day and it was not the next because the

210
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,900
Israeli Air Force came in and destroyed

211
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,240
it so it's widely is suspected that a

212
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,880
cyber attack played a role in turning

213
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,760
off the Syrian air defense before the

214
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,640
jets crossed the border to bomb the

215
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,459
plant and of course the details would be

216
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,290
highly classified but you can only

217
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,750
imagine that this is not only possible

218
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,850
but it's entirely

219
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,779
double today because you know we just

220
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,300
think about it all of this stuff takes

221
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,120
place via computer right finding

222
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,149
missiles or planes you know tracking

223
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:24,199
them attempting to hit them with anti

224
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:29,699
anti-aircraft battery the Corporal has

225
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,050
to communicate with the sergeant of the

226
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,579
sergeant has to communicate with the

227
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,800
captain and the captain has to call the

228
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,300
national security establishment so and

229
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,220
so forth all of those things are done by

230
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,089
computer and so any one of those points

231
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,240
you know if the Israeli military had

232
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,110
studied the adversary and found where

233
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,899
they could conduct a denial of service

234
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,480
attack at the right time the thing I

235
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,579
think about the cyber attacks is couple

236
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,199
things one you know there's a lot of

237
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,970
naysayers about cyber attacks and I hope

238
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,130
they're right and I hope we don't have

239
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,940
as much to fear as we as we could but

240
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,500
one the cyber attack is more or less a

241
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,690
means to an end but if not an end in

242
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,850
itself and it's just you know I get

243
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,620
control of the computer and what you

244
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,759
know what is that computer and the

245
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,350
person who normally assisted at yes what

246
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,579
do they have access to and what do they

247
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,980
do and then the second thing is timing

248
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,569
right if you get a hold of the right

249
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,050
computer and you know you you you think

250
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,959
about that the when to strike you know

251
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,160
you know with a denial of service attack

252
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
you could say well I could get my

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,139
website back up in an hour no problem

254
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,240
but if it's in a military context

255
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,089
getting your site back up in an hour you

256
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,699
know the operation may be over at that

257
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:50,100
point I'm so this in August was the

258
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,899
Syrian Ministry of Defense homepage so

259
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,980
let me know I'm going to read it to you

260
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,870
because I think it's really powerful

261
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,550
stuff so obviously this is an anonymous

262
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,670
defacements but to the Syrian people the

263
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,709
world stands with you against the brutal

264
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,889
regime of Bashar al-assad know that time

265
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,130
in history are on your side tyrants use

266
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,100
violence because they have nothing else

267
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,019
more violent they are the more fragile

268
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,569
they become we salute your determination

269
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,060
to be nonviolent in the face of the

270
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,240
regime's brutality and admire your

271
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,459
willingness to pursue justice not mere

272
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,759
revenge all tyrants will fall and thanks

273
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,040
to your bravery bus Bashar al-assad is

274
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,940
next to the Syrian military you are

275
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,769
responsible for protecting the Syrian

276
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,170
people and anyone who orders you to kill

277
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,240
women children and the elderly deserves

278
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,920
to be tried for treason no outside enemy

279
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,310
could do as much damage to Syria as bajo

280
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,160
el Assad has done defend your country

281
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,329
rise up against the regime anonymous

282
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,310
right I mean this is impressive this is

283
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,339
not only a group with hacker skills but

284
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,690
they're following current events and

285
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,790
they are attempting to impact history

286
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:21,029
and so this is a beautiful example of a

287
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,459
non-state actor who is able to interact

288
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,420
with heads of state right we saw this

289
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,569
already in 1999 when NATO had an

290
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,120
intervention over Kosovo there was

291
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,310
non-state hackers that were attempting

292
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,910
to degrade NATO military operations and

293
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,370
already in 1999 they had some modest

294
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,660
successes during the course of the the

295
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,050
the campaign NATO was forced to hire new

296
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,720
people to buy all new machines there was

297
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,459
tons of virus infected email that

298
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,870
overloaded their system and they

299
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,490
couldn't send email sites were down and

300
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:09,120
you can see how you know even first tier

301
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,709
you know national security

302
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,829
establishments can be affected by

303
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,100
unknown non-state actors in cyberspace

304
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,720
and so that this is this is really

305
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,000
important this is somewhere in the

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,769
middle between WikiLeaks and Stuxnet I

307
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,649
think you know this is not just pushing

308
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,980
information out this is not just

309
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,579
demonstrating

310
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,069
abilities and machines but it's actually

311
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:38,689
to some degree an attack right you are

312
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:43,470
manipulating not only data but because

313
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,739
we all live in cyberspace now and our

314
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:48,569
lives are affected by what we're reading

315
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:51,420
on the screen this is affecting the real

316
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,360
world so I just got back from four years

317
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,639
in Estonia where I was the US

318
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,889
Representative to the the NATO cyber

319
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,480
center there and I was God that was

320
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,439
lucky I got to be the first

321
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,879
international there and now they're up

322
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,389
to ten countries but since i was there

323
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:13,019
basically NATO has gone from almost no

324
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,360
interest in cyber to an overwhelming

325
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,220
interest in cyber so they have these

326
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,249
strategic documents that they publish

327
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,679
every couple of years and every ten

328
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,410
years they do a strategic concept for

329
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,449
the Alliance so already in 1999 it is

330
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,610
not so long ago think how far we've come

331
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,439
in such a short period of time so that

332
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,509
was the strategic concept that was

333
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,360
written in 1999 wasn't wasn't changed

334
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,199
until 2010 but in 1999 so there was

335
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,059
absolutely if you search the document

336
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,189
there is no mention of not only a hacker

337
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,559
or cyber attack but no mention of cyber

338
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,149
no mention of computer no mention of

339
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,999
network so it wasn't even you know ten

340
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,910
years ago the national security thinkers

341
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,160
of the foremost you know political

342
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,169
military alliance on the planet was not

343
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:08,549
even thinking about computers so in 2002

344
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,980
they start thinking about defending then

345
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,260
they forget about it again then they

346
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,069
think about developing then after the

347
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,619
incident in estonia in 2007 they talk

348
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,339
about cyber attacks and then by 2010

349
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,230
this is the new strategic concept so

350
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,769
Madeleine Albright former US Secretary

351
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,840
of State led a group that was advising

352
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,779
NATO prior to the rewriting of the

353
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,649
strategic concept in 2010 and what they

354
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,870
advised NATO was the three top threats

355
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,220
to NATO in the next 10 years would be

356
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,740
ballistic missiles

357
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,510
terrorism and you guessed it cyber

358
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,030
attacks so eventually this is the

359
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,130
wording they said cyber attacks now have

360
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,290
crossed the threshold where they

361
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,929
threaten euro-atlantic prosperity

362
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,260
security and stability and then goes

363
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,270
into some detail about how to address

364
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,970
the threat getting the organization

365
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,419
under some level of monitoring and

366
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,960
control and defense and then also

367
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,750
thinking about how to use cyber in order

368
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,250
to achieve political and military

369
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,330
objectives so the two things we're

370
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,660
looking at WikiLeaks and Stuxnet I think

371
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,340
you know both of them have implications

372
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,450
for national security in very different

373
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,270
ways right WikiLeaks is about taking

374
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,179
something and pushing it up right it

375
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,860
doesn't matter what it is I mean if it's

376
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,010
good people are going to be interested

377
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,320
you know but essentially is using the

378
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,480
amplification power of the internet

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,790
right and if you've got a good story to

380
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,320
tell you've got a good picture you've

381
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,679
taken you can put in everyone's living

382
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,320
room today and this is this is amazing

383
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,480
and this this is why I think national

384
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,350
security thinkers have to be on guard

385
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,950
today because they you never know what

386
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,090
is going to be in the news tomorrow

387
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,330
Stuxnet is different in that it's

388
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,190
reaching out from anywhere on the planet

389
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,980
down into any particular rabbit hole

390
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,070
right now that can be you know a former

391
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,120
spouse it can be a head of state or it

392
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,100
can be a nuclear program on the other

393
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,360
side of the planet and so that's

394
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,690
fundamentally entirely possible right if

395
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,669
because of the connectivity that exists

396
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:40,169
you know if you do enough reconnaissance

397
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,330
you can reach out and put your hand in

398
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,820
any particular hat and pull out a rabbit

399
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,400
and I think that's exactly what happened

400
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,480
with Stuxnet so let's talk first about

401
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,720
WikiLeaks I think WikiLeaks is is

402
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,400
significant impact but part of it though

403
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,940
is similar to sex drugs and rock and

404
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,450
roll right it's the it's the idea that

405
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,330
this is forbidden information or this

406
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,200
wasn't meant for me or this is seductive

407
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,750
and new there's a big element of that a

408
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,580
lot of the WikiLeaks documents are

409
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,950
really not so interesting they're very

410
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,860
mundane in fact and in fact many

411
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,290
publications have much better analysis

412
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,590
in writing and explanations than do the

413
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,240
documents and WikiLeaks however what

414
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,919
Julian Assange and Bradley Manning did

415
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,750
was offer us a peek behind the

416
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,760
government curtain right you know

417
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,630
because you can always say well

418
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,120
academics and journalists they don't

419
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,250
they don't know everything right only

420
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,860
the government knows and so you can

421
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,929
always blame your favorite periodical

422
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,120
for not being well enough informed but

423
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,860
surely the government knows surely the

424
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,360
government has all the answers right

425
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,580
well in fact I think that's one of the

426
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,080
important things about WikiLeaks is to

427
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,900
realize that this is another source but

428
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,179
don't confuse it with the truth right

429
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,540
it's just another source and you have to

430
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,910
be very careful so a lot of it goes to

431
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,440
trust right how do you evaluate trust

432
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,870
and you know eventually it goes back to

433
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,090
you individually it's all up to you

434
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,720
right you know whether you believe what

435
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,280
you see and what you read is real so a

436
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,360
lot of people in this room you'd love to

437
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,280
get published in Springer right why is

438
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,960
that it's because they published the

439
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,040
most articles in in computers and

440
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,380
computer security and they have the most

441
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,630
articles I believe in a lot of the

442
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,429
academic databases today so they publish

443
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,880
so many journals but it's well-respected

444
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,460
cell on the other hand I noticed was the

445
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,730
highest number of citations per article

446
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,620
so that's a little bit different right

447
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,470
if you really want your your article and

448
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,990
of course you might not be in this field

449
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,470
you know

450
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,900
but you'd like to find a journal that

451
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,880
has the highest level of credibility

452
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,400
right so in that sense you know say

453
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,620
foreign affairs as a little bit more

454
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,750
Miley I would love to get an article

455
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,120
published in foreign affairs but even

456
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,799
foreign affairs so the more articles you

457
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,179
read the more you realize they're just

458
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,159
written by real people normal people

459
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:34,309
like you and me with an opinion so you

460
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:36,860
know the economist for instance a couple

461
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,270
years ago I had a couple interviews with

462
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,340
the economist and then and then you know

463
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,750
I didn't get a quote in there and I

464
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,309
thought oh my goodness you must have to

465
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,049
be really be something to get into the

466
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,909
economist well last year then I was

467
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,140
interviewed twice by the economist and

468
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,750
both times quotes made it in right and

469
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,230
so uh hmm wow that's great but that's

470
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,789
kind of strange you know it's just me

471
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:57,500
right this isn't even an opinion so I

472
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,299
don't know I feel a little bit like

473
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,549
Groucho Marx right that's Romar's famous

474
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,650
comedian and he said well he said I

475
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,690
would never join a club that would have

476
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,530
me as a member right and so a little bit

477
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,539
about that you know by the time you you

478
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:14,360
you actually achieve something you had

479
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,950
you had wanted then you realize that

480
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,640
that in fact well might not be a perfect

481
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,380
think about the you know China Russia in

482
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,289
the US right if you ask them who you

483
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,510
trust you know there's a nationalistic

484
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,700
of patriotic aspect to that question

485
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,890
you're going to defend your own language

486
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,419
your own thinkers and that's going to

487
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,270
play a role in whom you trust in our

488
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,640
country I was very sad to see an article

489
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,890
now evidently this has changed about a

490
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,380
couple years ago anyway the most true in

491
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,270
fact the most trusted news source in the

492
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,850
United States was Fox News which is when

493
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,860
you watch Fox News you realize that it

494
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,440
is so emotional and so short-sighted

495
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,470
when you watch a lot of their you

496
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,120
shocked that it could be but in fact

497
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,110
that that's what the truth was so with

498
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,390
Julian Assange of course he's giving you

499
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,070
these documents right which are

500
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,570
you know a lot let's just say they're

501
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,730
stolen that's my belief anyway right

502
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,279
okay they were offered but their

503
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,080
intellectual property and if I belong to

504
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,149
a company I can't really take the

505
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:26,649
intellectual property of that company

506
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:28,630
and post it unless I have a really

507
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,950
really strong reason to do so and I

508
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,840
understand the whistleblower concept but

509
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,960
in general I think that a team of five

510
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,480
or six reviewers it WikiLeaks is

511
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,480
insufficient to review the wide range of

512
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,090
documents and that available to them and

513
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,159
we'll get to that in just a second but

514
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,710
one of the important aspects of computer

515
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,159
networks today are that even is the most

516
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,470
junior employee of your organization you

517
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,019
can have an impact right and so this is

518
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,200
great it makes the world much more

519
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,000
egalitarian which is really cool however

520
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,460
in this case so you have mafia boy in

521
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,379
the middle right and I like use menacing

522
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,440
in this example because as a

523
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,460
fifteen-year-old kid I mean I the

524
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,190
fifteen-year-old as a child right was

525
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,370
able to bring down dell and amazon and

526
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,950
some of the biggest companies online

527
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,059
just before he went off to school for

528
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:34,139
the day bradley manning on the left

529
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,269
essentially had access to you know half

530
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,730
a million a million classified documents

531
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,340
and was able just to you know remove

532
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,919
them from the network and hand them on

533
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,730
to the world Aldrich Ames on the right

534
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:54,490
was a CIA employee and he was already a

535
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,299
spine he got moved back from Rome Italy

536
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,759
to CIA headquarters and he sat down at

537
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,549
his desk and this is back before they

538
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,059
probably had very smart internal

539
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,080
divisions on the network and he

540
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,279
essentially had access to everything

541
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,710
right so he started passing on to the

542
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,500
Russians you know the whole double agent

543
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,460
file of the CIA and so he had access to

544
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,519
all this information that he had

545
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,679
no knowledge of no business knowing

546
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,570
about but he was able to pass it on and

547
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,950
that's just the power of you know having

548
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,019
access to the network and this is this

549
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,349
is going to be a real challenge I heard

550
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:36,539
a great talk by a Dutch general who just

551
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,009
got back he was in charge in southern

552
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:41,609
Afghanistan and so one of the aspects of

553
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:43,529
his talk he said that there was just way

554
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,269
too much classification in the military

555
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,190
such that you can't if you try to

556
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,450
classify everything you classified

557
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,429
nothing so he gave an example and he

558
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,049
said did you know that the weather in

559
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,419
the military is classified you know he

560
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:55,979
said I could never pass on the weather

561
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,570
to anyone in Afghanistan because it was

562
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,579
classified is that the palm is done

563
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,339
everything is classified and so that the

564
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,529
standards dropped so low for the

565
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:06,539
millions of documents he said one of the

566
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:07,799
things that militaries really need to

567
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,389
think about or what are the really

568
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:11,579
crucial aspects that need to be

569
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,989
classified and separate them out so

570
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:18,929
there's an example if you extrapolate

571
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,169
this into a more of a macro level you

572
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:27,059
can see that organizations offer a lot

573
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:30,929
more than individuals even here you have

574
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,999
the Turkish and Greek hackers that even

575
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,889
with innate within the NATO alliance are

576
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:38,369
doing battle in cyberspace you have not

577
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,259
only anonymous but you have the

578
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,999
electronic disturbance disturbance

579
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:43,950
theater which believes that you have to

580
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,139
say who you are and why you're doing

581
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:48,899
what you do and that you created this

582
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:52,049
tool in order to effect this change in

583
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:54,539
the world you have within countries you

584
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,339
have hackers that are packing their own

585
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,469
government and you know even within the

586
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,999
state of Texas you can have a pro

587
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:02,389
Israeli in a pro-palestinian hacker

588
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,609
engaged in Middle East conflict you know

589
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,909
from their homes in the United States

590
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,099
cult of the dead cow actually coined the

591
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,399
term hacktivism in 1994 so these things

592
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,769
in fact are not so new but they have

593
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:19,820
taken some time to percolate then to

594
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,869
come into our collective consciousness

595
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,839
so with all the documents that WikiLeaks

596
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,570
has provided us one of the questions I

597
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,979
think that's really important to ask is

598
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,760
is what

599
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,590
what have they told us you know what

600
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,679
what impact have they had at a strategic

601
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,190
level at a high level a national

602
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,260
security level and there's all kinds of

603
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,030
tactical things we've seen I saw

604
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,890
recently if you saw in the news that in

605
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,520
South Korea they lost a laptop a couple

606
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,580
of weeks ago and this laptop had really

607
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,520
sensitive information on it it had

608
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,929
basically all the battle plans for the

609
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,490
South Korean Air Force in the event of

610
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,130
conflict every possible battle plan and

611
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,860
so you know they're thinking now you

612
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,950
know how do we figure out how to you

613
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:13,549
know to recalculate all these battle

614
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:14,870
plans it's going to take a lot of time

615
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,120
and effort and it may not even be

616
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,590
possible because we're going to come up

617
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,020
with the same battle plans that took us

618
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,030
years to you know to to derive in the

619
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,100
first place so that's an example of a

620
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,960
tactical failure that could have

621
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,160
strategic implications there was a paper

622
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,840
written by the University of Colorado

623
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,350
published this year that looked at the

624
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,610
77,000 documents that WikiLeaks

625
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,700
published relative to Afghanistan so

626
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,169
they put all those documents into a

627
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,020
database and then with a specific goal

628
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,240
of trying to see whether the story they

629
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,770
told is different from what the

630
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,270
politicians have been telling us and

631
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,309
their conclusion was that at the

632
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:55,280
strategic level they did not they said

633
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,740
that essentially the 70,000 77,000

634
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,880
documents on Afghanistan were a great

635
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,820
catalog of military tactics especially

636
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,120
for military buffs and historians but

637
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,790
basin and they looked at casualties they

638
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,830
look at locations they look at weapons

639
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,270
etc but from a strategic perspective

640
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,370
they said they only told us what we

641
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,750
already knew you know the the the

642
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,950
insurgency was intensifying it was

643
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,330
spreading and the number of casualties

644
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,740
was was rising I've been thinking about

645
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,299
this and part of it is that from a

646
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,250
strategic perspective I'm starting to

647
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,290
assume that there is very little that

648
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,390
you could actually classify right

649
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,000
because it's too big it's too important

650
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
there are too many data points right if

651
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,480
the question and the answer are

652
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,090
strategic in nature and strategic and

653
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,190
scope tactic

654
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,350
things are great to classify you know

655
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,549
you probably know I'm going to attack

656
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,649
you but you have no idea when with what

657
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,139
forces what conditions what weather that

658
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:55,429
sort of thing those are things that are

659
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:57,649
great to classify right Sun Tzu would

660
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,529
really recommend that you know that i

661
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,659
classify you know what time of day I

662
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,720
intend to attack you but the strategic

663
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,490
questions these are much harder because

664
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,289
they have so many data points so I'm

665
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,110
trying to think about this until so what

666
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,580
I did was I went into the internet movie

667
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,500
database right and I start looking for

668
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,899
research done on it this is just one

669
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:21,289
one-hundredth of the 75 77 thousand

670
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,990
documents that WikiLeaks gave us on

671
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,210
Afghanistan and I wondered how many of

672
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,419
them are extraordinary and so I couldn't

673
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,250
read all 77,000 documents but what I

674
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,049
thought is that IMDb might tell us

675
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,649
something about this and so the green on

676
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:39,259
here these are sixes so the average

677
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:43,370
score and I mbv is 6.2 so I said okay

678
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,950
all six is anything between six and

679
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,710
seven is green anything 5 and 7 i'll

680
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,840
make yellow and everything else is red

681
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,509
right so just the middle there is green

682
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:54,919
and yellow and everything else is red

683
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,190
and so um you know this is imperfect

684
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,690
obviously but what it does is it show

685
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,009
you where the outliers are there was a

686
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,659
good book written a couple years ago

687
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,059
called outliers and I know if you read

688
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,039
it but it was all about what makes the

689
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,019
beatles the beatles what and what makes

690
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,539
a regular group a regular group right

691
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,299
and so there's some really good aspects

692
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,009
of the book a lot of things you have too

693
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:20,539
much to go into but you know Miyazaki's

694
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,759
only come along every so often right

695
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,940
that you know I most movies I hate and I

696
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,929
can't even sit down and watch a movie

697
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:30,590
but the miyazaki movies like spirited

698
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,090
away etc if you've seen them you can

699
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,259
literally you can watch them over and

700
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,080
over again right and over and that's why

701
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,570
score is very high then damn jean-claude

702
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,210
van damme came in just under the radar

703
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,059
in terms of bad but I figure you know

704
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,889
that we also have really good

705
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:47,870
politicians and really bad politicians

706
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,519
and so if you look at this from the

707
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,640
macro level I did a paper

708
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,200
a few years ago with roll-off hemming

709
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,910
who is also a sing a sponsor of this

710
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,680
conference the founder of since post and

711
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,140
preserva and he talks a lot about the

712
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,120
bell curve you know and most people are

713
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,230
somewhere in the middle but these

714
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,790
extremes out here you've got to watch

715
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,800
out for these are the significant things

716
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,350
and these are the red squares on here

717
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,070
they're either good or bad but one of

718
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,680
the things I want to say is that is that

719
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,360
I think WikiLeaks could tell us a lot

720
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,940
about tactics but maybe not so much

721
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:26,630
about strategy WikiLeaks also has a

722
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,710
couple of problems so the most so one of

723
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,620
them is its internal disarray right he's

724
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,420
lost a lot of friends Julian Assange

725
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,210
over what he's doing in particular how

726
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,160
he's doing it and some of it is really

727
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,990
related to sources and so with just five

728
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,580
or six people reviewing these documents

729
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,010
before publishing home online you can't

730
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,570
expect that they have the expertise to

731
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,600
deal with all this information in the

732
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,070
first place however when you look at for

733
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,230
instance the Taliban have confirmed that

734
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,880
they've used WikiLeaks to find spies

735
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,940
within their organization we had a

736
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,370
reporter from Ethiopia who just had to

737
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,340
flee his country because of WikiLeaks

738
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,469
had because he was outed as a source and

739
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,750
in this case we have Zimbabwe so

740
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,870
WikiLeaks and anonymous etc they work

741
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,690
against Zimbabwe actively however in

742
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,219
this case where they publish the

743
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,960
WikiLeaks documents basically there's a

744
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,940
lot of source information in there that

745
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,199
puts lives at risk right so this is an

746
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,510
example of how anything can be taken to

747
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,770
a fault you know chocolate etc you know

748
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,449
publishing all this information without

749
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,668
removing the sources without really

750
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,679
thinking about what you're doing and in

751
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,800
each individual case can really put

752
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,870
lives in danger and so you can clearly

753
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,750
see this is a Zimbabwe government op-ed

754
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,418
in a newspaper a few weeks ago you know

755
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:56,389
basically saying you know we will

756
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,400
investigate take decisive disciplinary

757
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,810
action and

758
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,700
this is from a government to according

759
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,250
to Amnesty International yuno commits

760
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,950
torture and no one is ever brought to

761
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,460
account for it so let's switch our

762
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,940
attention to wiki I mean to sucks net so

763
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,280
you know I'm sure there's science

764
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,460
fiction fans in the crowd and Stuxnet is

765
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,040
an example of you know Arthur Clarke's

766
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,080
third rule that any sufficiently

767
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,000
advanced technology is indistinguishable

768
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,500
from magic right so this is just code

769
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,080
right you know who you know even a few

770
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,920
years ago you can't imagine I mean put

771
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,550
yourself in the shoes of a Iranian

772
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:49,310
nuclear weapons program technician right

773
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:54,050
and your equipment self-destructs before

774
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,170
your eyes but the monitor the screen is

775
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,460
telling you that everything is normal

776
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,190
everything is fine right this is

777
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,970
essentially what happened and so the

778
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,830
code that was in the system was was bad

779
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,530
right and so we know from history from

780
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,820
the history of computer security that is

781
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,530
entirely possible to to it in fact and

782
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,410
to subvert a compiler so that everything

783
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,790
that gets compiled with that the program

784
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,090
in the future has a backdoor right it's

785
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,460
simply a fact it has been proven over

786
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,150
and over again so what can you trust

787
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,110
this goes back to you know probably our

788
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,850
thoughts on on wikileaks but can you

789
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,760
trust your code there was it was up in

790
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,170
the beltway for a long time that's the

791
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,600
DC area and there used to be this famous

792
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,880
anecdote about the NSA and the National

793
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,190
Security Agency the hackers put together

794
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,290
just a hundred lines of code and they

795
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,150
passed it around the Beltway for various

796
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,070
agencies to look at and no one could

797
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,710
find all of the Easter eggs and all of

798
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,300
the vulnerabilities in all of the

799
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,890
intentional weaknesses and a hundred

800
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:10,010
lines of code right so in the 20 million

801
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,870
lines of code that belonged to Windows

802
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,300
most of which are dead code are not even

803
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,760
doing anything anymore you know how in

804
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,000
the world can you secure this and just

805
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,460
as Bruce Schneier likes to say these

806
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,950
things are too complex to secure

807
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,480
computers right very hard so this in

808
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,220
fact is the new sword if you just look

809
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,980
at the facts surrounding the the program

810
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,910
it's hard to come to any other

811
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,620
conclusion then this is a

812
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,010
first-of-its-kind an example of a

813
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,930
computer network attack that we have not

814
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,770
seen before some of the debate today is

815
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,710
over whether this was was would be

816
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,570
difficult to pull off again you have

817
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,160
Ralph longer we brought him up to

818
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,890
Estonia recently for a talk terrific

819
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,740
speaker and he believes that it that

820
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,100
this could be repackaged and used again

821
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,100
and unknown circumstances in the future

822
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,170
and I've seen other experts online

823
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:18,620
saying so that's unrealistic and this

824
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,240
was so difficult to pull off and you

825
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,640
need so much intelligence on your target

826
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,770
and so on so forth is it's not going to

827
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,980
happen at least very easily however look

828
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,320
at the basic aspects just the cop the

829
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,000
top 240 I would call military grade

830
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,160
quality of this program so you have to

831
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,900
test it on real infrastructure right

832
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,240
that all of a sudden takes the number of

833
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,760
possible authors down to a very small

834
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,730
circle right now all of us in the room

835
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,250
possess a nuclear centrifuge at home on

836
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,370
which to test our code the second thing

837
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,980
is the first programmable logic

838
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,220
controller rootkit right so sort of it

839
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,760
the the code is hidden and the

840
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,230
technicians see that everything is

841
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,630
normal right these are two things that

842
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,610
really separate Stuxnet from everything

843
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,800
else now you always have to look at

844
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,780
context right people don't do anything

845
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,460
in a

846
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,480
Hume and Stuxnet is no different now

847
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,599
such that was so difficult to pull off

848
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,180
it must be that it was written for a

849
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,820
very important reason right and somebody

850
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,030
felt a high level of urgency to affect

851
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,089
this operation and to try and alter the

852
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:38,770
course of history even right because

853
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,060
this is I'm going to argue this is a

854
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,520
strategic weapon Stuxnet right so just

855
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,119
think about it the Israeli Air Force has

856
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,020
destroyed a nuclear facility in Iraq in

857
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,599
1981 in Syria in 2007 and these are

858
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,400
events that risk not only international

859
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,619
censure even in 1981 when they attack

860
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:08,640
Iraq the United States was furious and

861
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,180
newspapers in the United States

862
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,930
described it as terrorism right so this

863
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,480
was a big big deal that involved high

864
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,200
risks for for especially for Israel and

865
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,240
and and Iraq in the Middle East because

866
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,589
you're risking a wider war right but the

867
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:29,170
pilots when they flew back from Iraq to

868
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,130
Israel I saw this yesterday they were

869
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,380
quoting scripture from the Old Testament

870
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,460
from the Jewish Bible and so don't

871
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,099
underestimate the context within which

872
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,650
all of this lies because you don't have

873
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,330
to read much about the history of Israel

874
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,839
in their national security thinking to

875
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,320
understand that they believe they are

876
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,290
living on a knife's edge and it could

877
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,900
all end tomorrow right that's that's

878
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:07,000
that's for sure so cyber wars that we

879
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,880
have seen to date I don't think make the

880
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,490
cut even from the standpoint of

881
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,580
evaluating WikiLeaks and so we looked at

882
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,170
Georgia which is kind of a military case

883
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,420
model estonia the movement of this

884
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,060
statue across town this is a political

885
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,720
business case model right estonia

886
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,830
essentially that you took away their

887
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,960
banking and there

888
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,849
media for a short period of time sort of

889
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:33,119
exposing their level of relying on the

890
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,150
Internet to vulnerability the Chechens

891
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,800
if you haven't followed this story they

892
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,410
are brilliant at propaganda and they

893
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,940
ever since the beginning of the World

894
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,190
Wide Web they have used the internet in

895
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,630
order to show their conflict with Russia

896
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,109
in to raise money and to bring money

897
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:59,520
back to the field of battle in the

898
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,560
United States the there is a an

899
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,339
obsession with Chinese hackers and so

900
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:06,690
that's where most of the focus from the

901
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,330
Pentagon is under this massive loss of

902
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,430
data to China or the perceived loss of

903
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,520
data almost for sure it's not all China

904
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,970
but it's a big internet space there that

905
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,670
anyone could operate through me and more

906
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,740
on the last you know when when they had

907
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,099
the crackdown in 2007 on pro-democracy

908
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:30,660
protesters they decided just to unplug

909
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,060
the internet for two weeks right so we

910
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,440
always talk about borders in cyberspace

911
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,930
and where the the lack of borders but in

912
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,369
fact I think there are all kinds of

913
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,890
borders that can be manipulated and then

914
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,420
in the middle east conflict this is a

915
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,910
terrific example this is when there were

916
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,500
three Israeli soldiers kidnapped in

917
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,980
Lebanon in two thousand and so the

918
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,260
Israelis I pro-israeli hackers they

919
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,420
decided to they hit the is hizbollah

920
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,460
website right and it was a powerful

921
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,630
enough attack but it was difficult for

922
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,400
Hezbollah to get rid of and then they

923
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,349
found when they tried to change their

924
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,770
URL or all spellings of Hezbollah and

925
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,240
various misspellings had already been

926
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,950
brought up by someone before the attack

927
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,770
took place so if you look at the

928
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,570
arab-israeli conflict it is a great

929
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,089
example also of the means to an end

930
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:20,339
concept of cyber attacks in that really

931
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,380
often pro-israeli hackers will hit sites

932
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,869
of political military significance but

933
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,300
pro-palestinian hackers will go right to

934
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,760
their the target of the Israeli economy

935
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,950
and every time there's a flare-up in the

936
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,560
Middle East hundreds of Israeli

937
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,020
businesses will go offline so

938
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,880
talk a little bit about you know the the

939
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,770
implication power of the internet

940
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,060
pushing things out but here's another

941
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,810
way to look at it that distinguishes

942
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:51,290
stuffs net from historical worms so

943
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,630
other examples you know let's let's see

944
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,820
how many machines and how quickly we can

945
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,220
undo we can compromise them in order to

946
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,470
accomplish a goal stuffs that again it's

947
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,110
backwards its opposite right it's let's

948
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,440
find this particular target so in this

949
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,680
target was you know PLC that consoled

950
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,080
nuclear centrifuges in Iran right and so

951
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,250
the damage could have been much greater

952
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,510
it wasn't it wasn't a criminal

953
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,950
organization that's looking for your

954
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,540
credit card numbers it's finding

955
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,370
something very very specific out there

956
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,920
and again it's it makes it a very high

957
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,230
value target especially considering all

958
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,470
of the resources that were put into to

959
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,860
develop the program so here's the target

960
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,230
the siemens plc and so appealing what is

961
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,210
the plc i mean appear you think about it

962
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,250
they were developed in the automotive

963
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,650
industry right because you had people

964
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,230
you know starting to mass produce cars

965
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,680
and then you know they wanted to bring

966
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,630
in information technology in order to

967
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,640
speed this process up right you want to

968
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,930
make it more efficient you want to make

969
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,810
a more of a profit for your company and

970
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,780
so then you bring in equipment equipment

971
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,480
that can spray a call black or red or

972
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
white other than the plc what does it do

973
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,720
it because when they first bought that

974
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,970
technology in then when you wanted to

975
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,310
switch from a white car to a red car you

976
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,630
actually had to bring in the welders and

977
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,460
the electricians and they had to unplug

978
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,820
everything replug different equipment in

979
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,370
in order to do it in the plc is meant to

980
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,770
bridge that gap you know you can

981
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:28,040
actually program via software you know

982
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,570
switching it from a reg will light car

983
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,910
and so it is a it is an industrial

984
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,700
device it's a computer that can

985
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,570
withstand high temperatures vibration

986
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,940
essentially industrial environmental

987
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,790
considerations the target then is the

988
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,230
centrifuge so in this case of Stuxnet

989
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,320
they

990
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,200
basically the light blue and the blood

991
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,780
and the dark blue dots these are uranium

992
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,950
235 and uranium 238 you want the 235

993
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,910
right if you take natural uranium

994
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,670
uranium 235 is I think it's point seven

995
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,080
percent right um 238 is like ninety-nine

996
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,280
percent so what you want to do is enrich

997
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,460
the uranium in a centrifuge so

998
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,920
centrifuge is sort of it can separate

999
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,530
anything right it spins and the heavier

1000
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,840
material falls and the lighter material

1001
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,740
Rises and so it can separate you cream

1002
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,350
from milk you know for instance and so

1003
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:35,420
the uranium 235 Rises you scoop it out

1004
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:38,660
and then you enrich uranium takes a long

1005
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,060
time it takes thousands of centrifuges

1006
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,030
to enrich uranium from that point seven

1007
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,680
percent just a three or three and a half

1008
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,360
percent such that you can use it in a

1009
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,450
reactor but you have to enrich the rain

1010
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,970
all the way to over ninety percent which

1011
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,790
takes a lot of time and effort in order

1012
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,360
to develop a nuclear weapon and these

1013
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,730
centrifuges they are so sensitive but

1014
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,130
even fingerprints left on them can

1015
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,230
destroy the machine during the process

1016
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:10,760
right so what the Stuxnet code did was

1017
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,540
it's so these are supposed to turn at

1018
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,810
about a thousand Hertz right and the

1019
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,970
Stuxnet code then while it was telling

1020
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,950
the engineers that everything was okay

1021
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,060
it's raised the speed to about one point

1022
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,570
four thousand Hertz right and then 27

1023
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,790
days later it lowered it to a few

1024
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,660
hundred Hertz all the while telling the

1025
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,340
engineers that it was on targeted a

1026
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,100
thousand this was sufficient to destroy

1027
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,230
the machine right because the parts

1028
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,780
couldn't take this pressure it forced

1029
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,700
the parts into contact with each other

1030
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,210
such that the machine would be destroyed

1031
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:53,630
now a former IAEA weapons inspector

1032
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,400
recently said just a couple weeks ago in

1033
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,700
an interview that he believes about

1034
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,620
2,000 centrifuges were destroyed in Iran

1035
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,090
one of the big questions about stuffs

1036
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,890
net is why not more why not less who

1037
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,640
knows maybe the op wasn't successful

1038
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,470
maybe it was maybe the Iranians aren't

1039
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,090
telling us everything well maybe they're

1040
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,060
telling us stuff we want to hear right

1041
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,730
so with a lot of these intelligence

1042
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,260
questions you never really know the full

1043
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,120
truth but these are some of the things

1044
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,090
we do know from analysis and reverse

1045
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:26,750
engineering about the code so the air

1046
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,660
gap right well obviously a nuclear

1047
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,580
weapons program is not connected to the

1048
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,110
internet right obviously well is

1049
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,210
anything never really connected to the

1050
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,150
internet right because you know that

1051
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,410
code had to get there in the first place

1052
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,410
you know there's a supply chain

1053
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,610
intervention which intelligence services

1054
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,370
are capable of there's insider threat

1055
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,740
but then also you have to move the data

1056
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,540
back and forth for it to be of any value

1057
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,900
to anybody right so the air gap means

1058
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,310
that physically electrically and

1059
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,960
electromagnetically you want to separate

1060
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,060
a network from an untrusted network

1061
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,460
right so in all those ways it can't be

1062
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,500
emitting you know beyond a certain level

1063
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,970
it can be connected to the same

1064
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,770
electrical infrastructure and so and so

1065
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:17,180
forth you know so there are all kinds of

1066
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,680
ways that a bad guy might connect an

1067
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,740
unconnected network however even with

1068
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,260
the most air gap Network you still have

1069
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,940
this sneaker netting of data back and

1070
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,250
forth and so Stuxnet knew a couple

1071
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,100
things one the authors of Stuxnet one of

1072
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,360
the vulnerabilities they wanted to take

1073
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,790
advantage of they knew was well known

1074
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:40,010
and should have been patched but SCADA

1075
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,330
infrastructure doesn't really get

1076
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,190
patched right because you need this

1077
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,570
stuff to be up and running all the time

1078
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,600
you don't want it to be broken or down

1079
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,020
for any period of time and and because

1080
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,160
it's not connected to the internet

1081
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,690
people don't worry about patching things

1082
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,240
so that's one thing but another thing

1083
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,350
was they put this the attack was

1084
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,080
designed troubled by USB stick so they

1085
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,120
put it in the environment right somehow

1086
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,930
who knows put it in the environment

1087
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,500
around the target such that it would

1088
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:15,390
eventually make its way via USB into the

1089
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,910
target now another thing about it was

1090
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,859
that it almost certainly looks like it

1091
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,950
had lawyers looking at this attack

1092
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,280
because a USB stick was only supposed to

1093
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,980
inspect three machines and it was an

1094
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,720
infected machine was only supposed to

1095
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,630
stay contagious for 21 days and then in

1096
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,240
June I think of next year the program is

1097
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,099
supposed to delete itself right so it

1098
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,800
doesn't last forever however this is a

1099
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,800
great lesson for us that the air gap is

1100
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,059
not inviolable right it is it is in fact

1101
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:52,400
somewhat of an imaginary river to cross

1102
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,890
so between WikiLeaks and Stuxnet both of

1103
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,270
them are significant and both of them

1104
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,420
keep politicians probably up late at

1105
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,210
night but I think that such that is the

1106
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:06,690
winner in this particular debate because

1107
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,059
it essentially crossed a threshold it

1108
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,690
may not be a revolution as much as it is

1109
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,930
a revelation mysis my suspicion is that

1110
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,819
professional hackers you know within

1111
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:19,920
intelligence services this is not the

1112
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,670
first time they have seen such an attack

1113
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,260
but for the public the rest of us the

1114
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,839
many people this is this is quite a

1115
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,030
revolution you know this this kind of

1116
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,400
attack which is intended to achieve

1117
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,460
military results what a military results

1118
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,109
not fair results if you talk to you know

1119
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:41,190
lawyers on the law of armed conflict for

1120
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,349
instance i mean if somebody's gotta die

1121
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:46,829
or there has to be significant physical

1122
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:50,960
damage but if you think about the

1123
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,780
implications for such cyber attacks you

1124
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,700
know can you imagine that you could

1125
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,599
accomplish a strategic objective with no

1126
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:03,569
casualties no collateral damage no

1127
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:06,900
sparking a wider war I mean if it is

1128
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,220
really here for us again for the third

1129
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,799
time had bombed this target left a big

1130
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:14,609
smoking hole in the ground you can only

1131
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:15,720
imagine that

1132
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,820
a short order you know there would be

1133
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,220
missiles flying and people dying in

1134
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,109
multiple countries in the Middle East

1135
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,140
and perhaps beyond but if the

1136
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,470
centrifuges just stopped working it's

1137
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,580
much more difficult to admit to to

1138
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,240
affect a response in the physical world

1139
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,180
it's just it's a fact and it's a from a

1140
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,280
historical perspective I think the

1141
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,530
Stuxnet has taught us showed us quite a

1142
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:46,560
lot so I think the pen is more powerful

1143
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,150
than ever there's there's there's no one

1144
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,470
who would disagree with the fact that

1145
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,170
the entire world if you're an author is

1146
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,880
your potential audience there's a great

1147
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,859
case the guy gave me a good book

1148
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:03,420
recently my metro 2033 which is very

1149
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,849
very popular in Russia this author young

1150
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,950
author wrote this science-fiction novel

1151
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,750
he couldn't find anyone to publish it in

1152
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,240
Moscow so I just thought well my last

1153
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,280
resort is to put it on the internet he

1154
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,890
put on the internet in it in it became

1155
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,930
so popular in Russia but now he's got

1156
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:21,030
you know obviously book deals lined up

1157
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:25,260
video games and movies as well so no one

1158
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,119
is going to dispute the fact that you

1159
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,580
know the pen is more powerful than ever

1160
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,530
but I believe that the sword has somehow

1161
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,609
grain gaining ground on it right and we

1162
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:37,830
should all be worried about the state of

1163
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,700
our security on planet earth when you

1164
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,260
know nuclear weapons literally can

1165
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,070
destroy the planet in this case that

1166
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:48,599
according to the New York Times Stuxnet

1167
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:50,550
is the best counter-proliferation op

1168
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,650
that the West has against Iran today

1169
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,950
most effective IAEA has said 2,000

1170
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,640
centrifuges physically destroyed so I

1171
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,780
think that this has implications for us

1172
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:08,339
this strategic hacking into national

1173
00:54:08,339 --> 00:54:09,990
critical infrastructures of your

1174
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,830
adversary or your rival these are things

1175
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,089
that have to begin today and one of the

1176
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,790
differences I saw Michael Hayden this

1177
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,270
was last year black hats keynote talk

1178
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,640
right he said what I might it be

1179
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,070
possible or might be a better

1180
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,610
diya aur ok to bomb a factory but not

1181
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,790
hack it nobody nobody said anything he

1182
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,320
said the reason is is because you can

1183
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,660
choose the bomb of factory tomorrow but

1184
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,670
you cannot choose to hack a factory

1185
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,890
tomorrow hiking in fact takes months and

1186
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,290
months of subversion hard work and

1187
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,870
undermining the security of your target

1188
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,660
so he said take you know the the

1189
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,150
electricity supply of Paris or Moscow or

1190
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,030
New York these are targets that have to

1191
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:00,330
begin to be attacked today in peacetime

1192
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,480
hisses when fury you're going to have 43

1193
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,340
intelligence services trying to

1194
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:09,120
undermine the the electricity supply to

1195
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,260
a potential rival or potential

1196
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,390
combatants you know in worker and he

1197
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,370
said this is just not a good idea or for

1198
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:23,070
anyone and so I think you can imagine

1199
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,530
that one you know sites of strategic

1200
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,510
significance need to be on guard today

1201
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,970
they need to be thinking today that they

1202
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,950
might be a target by intelligence

1203
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,630
services terrorist groups that are

1204
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,740
seeking to undermine their security

1205
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,220
today in the events that there is some

1206
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,080
scenario which may arise that would

1207
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,040
threaten conflict and then also I think

1208
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,590
that this this mutually assured

1209
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,140
destruction in cyberspace that talked

1210
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,810
about it could lead to arms control

1211
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,600
treaties so I had just published a book

1212
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,030
before i left the the cyber center in

1213
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:02,150
Estonian I which I look at these four

1214
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:07,320
for likely national strategies to

1215
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,240
mitigate the cyber threat from a

1216
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,520
strategic perspective this is if you're

1217
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,020
not you're not in charge of one or a

1218
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,670
hundred or even a thousand computers but

1219
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,600
you're looking at from a national

1220
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,940
perspective you now look at the art of

1221
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,860
war and it's it's sort of impact on

1222
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,980
military doctrine around the world and I

1223
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,230
wrote a paper you know kind of outlining

1224
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,910
how here's the art of war and here's

1225
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,070
cyber war where does the site was the

1226
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,440
piece that is out that is of cyber that

1227
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,940
is kind of outside of our traditional

1228
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,620
understanding of good military doctrine

1229
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,250
I look at deterrence so the good thing

1230
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,020
about deterrence and arms control and

1231
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,730
such these are very mature

1232
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:43,380
topics these are topics that we really

1233
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,030
understand well especially from the Cold

1234
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,430
War so it with insurance you sort of

1235
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,619
have two strategies there's denial and

1236
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,530
there is punishment so denial means that

1237
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,810
I'm going to prevent you from acquiring

1238
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:56,880
the technology that you need to threaten

1239
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,700
me right and that's really difficult in

1240
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,740
cyberspace right because conferences

1241
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,570
like this for example in which you can

1242
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,510
learn hacking so then the second thing

1243
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,090
is punishment and then the two really

1244
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,520
crucial aspects of cyber attacks and

1245
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,760
cyber security and with this attribution

1246
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,510
problem and the the asymmetry problem

1247
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,250
with cyber attacks both of them really

1248
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,900
chip away at the credibility of

1249
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,090
deterrence by punishment so that's hard

1250
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,530
ipv6 I look at from the standpoint of

1251
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:32,010
technology is it possible to to invest

1252
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,510
in technology such that you make the

1253
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:36,210
problem go away because technologies is

1254
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,740
only getting more complex and more

1255
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,980
diverse and more difficult to secure but

1256
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,500
I think one good example of a technology

1257
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,080
that may be a game changer is ipv6 right

1258
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,100
because there's a lot of problems with

1259
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,830
ipv4 IP physics is going to try and

1260
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:53,700
correct them by making IPSec and good

1261
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,970
encryption authentication sort of

1262
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:00,240
defined within the protocol so so I look

1263
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,940
at that issue and then arms control and

1264
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,130
arms control is something I think just

1265
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:06,840
as general Hayden said last year we may

1266
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,850
have to look at a non-aggression treaty

1267
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:12,210
in cyberspace or limitation on cyber

1268
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,480
weapons pledges not to attack financial

1269
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,790
infrastructure critical infrastructure

1270
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,550
these are things that I can imagine why

1271
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:24,090
because all of us are vulnerable right

1272
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:25,830
and I think we see that in this this

1273
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,510
case that came out yesterday in the news

1274
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,030
of the drone program in the United

1275
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,940
States there is a virus that they can't

1276
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,650
get rid of right in the drone program

1277
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,410
and that also is an example of network

1278
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,590
that should have been air-gapped that

1279
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,340
should have been you know had high level

1280
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,780
of protection but I think in fact what

1281
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:49,560
it shows is that no one is is secure

1282
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,810
right because all of us rely on

1283
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,420
learning systems and applications

1284
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,460
protocols services that have

1285
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,430
vulnerabilities and if in if attackers

1286
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,160
spend enough time and effort targeting

1287
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,100
you personally or your organization

1288
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,330
they're going to find a way to get in

1289
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:08,910
because these things are so complicated

1290
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,980
these things are difficult to secure

1291
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,280
because they are so complicated so

1292
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,840
there's the book as a free download all

1293
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,460
the best things in life are free by the

1294
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,950
way and and so this is on the cyber

1295
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,510
Center website you can feel free to

1296
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,090
download it if you like and I even if

1297
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,560
you want to a hard copy you can send me

1298
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,720
an email and maybe I can send you a hard

1299
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,390
copy of the of the book and essentially

1300
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,480
what I'm looking at is trying to look at

1301
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,380
cyber security from a strategic

1302
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,290
perspective and think about if you're a

1303
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,780
national security advisor to the head of

1304
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,850
your government what would you recommend

1305
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,430
and I think all those four strategies in

1306
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,800
fact they each will be tried by

1307
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,940
governments you know you're going to

1308
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,860
have to try and also your doctrine you

1309
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,910
know you're going to have to try and

1310
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,580
deter whether it's only through threats

1311
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,920
of law enforcement or or public

1312
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,100
disclosure of an attack you're gonna

1313
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,020
have to try these this for and more

1314
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,000
these are not of course the only for you

1315
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,310
could try but that's what I look at in

1316
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,550
the book so many thanks for your time I

1317
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:11,410
think I've got down to one minute so I

1318
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,240
appreciate I'd be happy over coffee

1319
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,160
outside to take any questions but I I

1320
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,050
assume we need to move on to the coffee

1321
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:25,600
break it's up to you I you're talking

1322
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,980
about centrifuges my name is

1323
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,380
southborough i'm representing pc calm

1324
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,780
magazine you're talking about the

1325
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,460
mechanism by which they destroyed

1326
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,450
centrifuges you mentioned hurts no sorry

1327
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,880
you want to do what is the plc do to

1328
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,690
what did this stop next cause the hurts

1329
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:48,550
in the centrifuge isn't it RPM right so

1330
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:49,870
my understanding is you know you have a

1331
01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:52,060
technician who you know who's at a

1332
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,520
computer that is using what using

1333
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,250
windows right MA but on that system is

1334
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,390
software steps

1335
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,720
7 / siemens right in order to talk to

1336
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,750
the PLC and the PLC is kind of a middle

1337
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,309
man that's telling the infrastructure

1338
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:08,619
what to do right so you know the

1339
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,089
engineer is saying okay I need you to

1340
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:13,390
spin at a thousand 64 hurts right this

1341
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,730
is revolutions per minute a hood samia I

1342
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,170
don't yeah yeah I'm not a nuclear

1343
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,210
engineer I apologize but I understand

1344
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,150
that it's the thousands T four Hertz and

1345
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,220
at some level that translates into a

1346
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:30,959
number of revolutions per minute or or

1347
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,819
others another word for it I apologize

1348
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:37,329
in terms of a nuclear centrifuge however

1349
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:40,150
the speed at which the material is

1350
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,789
turning in this interview and so you

1351
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:45,609
know and that's to divide the 2 35 to 38

1352
01:01:45,609 --> 01:01:47,799
right and so you want to scoop the 235

1353
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:49,450
out and that's the whole point of the

1354
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:53,079
enrichment process and so basically what

1355
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,789
I understand is that you want to spin

1356
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:56,920
the machine too fast and then too slow

1357
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,010
and because of extreme sensitivity of

1358
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,869
this material you will in fact destroy

1359
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:04,240
the machine if you're not running it

1360
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,730
properly so was the programmable logic

1361
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,710
controller making the fellow go from one

1362
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:12,309
that 1.4 well whatever hurts what he

1363
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:14,109
kilohertz down to some what would the

1364
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:15,940
slow speed you mentioned they lost that

1365
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,460
I said what again I wanted to be careful

1366
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,960
because one of the sources I said she

1367
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,819
saw it said 2 Hertz and the others one

1368
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:24,220
said a few hundred so i'm not sure but

1369
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,230
in any case it was too fast and then too

1370
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:28,630
slow not at the speed that it should be

1371
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:32,230
going on and that damaged the thing

1372
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,750
that's right it would in fact in effect

1373
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,789
destroy the machine and so the IAEA

1374
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:39,009
event lee through its its on-site

1375
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,859
cameras there saw the removal of about a

1376
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,440
thousand machines i think and so it's

1377
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,680
it's speculated that Stuxnet was was the

1378
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,630
cause because it occurred about the same

1379
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,269
time the Stuxnet would was active now

1380
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,299
would it have been more secure if they

1381
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:57,549
had used open source software say like

1382
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,500
minutes I mean if Iranian have been

1383
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,470
using Linux instead of windows sure why

1384
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:04,779
not I think I mean I mean the thing is I

1385
01:03:04,779 --> 01:03:07,720
mean fair enough maybe an average

1386
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,660
computer virus might

1387
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,630
attack among might not be designed to

1388
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,369
attack most computer viruses are not

1389
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:16,559
designed to attack sit in a Linux PC but

1390
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,930
when it's in the hands or somebody with

1391
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:21,420
a highly technical people with a highly

1392
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,119
specific strategic purpose I mean who is

1393
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,039
Linux and more secure than Windows it

1394
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:27,390
that's right i think if you look around

1395
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:30,299
the world you'll see that the various

1396
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:32,430
governments red flag Linux and in China

1397
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,010
and Germany was very interested in Linux

1398
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,510
and not only from a financial

1399
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,799
perspective you don't have to pay

1400
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:39,990
Microsoft but you can perhaps configure

1401
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:46,109
it in a unique fashion right so sure why

1402
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:47,970
not I I think probably you'd want to

1403
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,460
diversify your infrastructure in order

1404
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,440
to make it more difficult for an

1405
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,059
attacker I mean we have we have this

1406
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:55,650
problem within the US government you

1407
01:03:55,650 --> 01:04:00,270
know everyone wants to standardize the

1408
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,190
system you know everyone should be on

1409
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,900
the same operating system and everyone

1410
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,280
should have the same type of password

1411
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,690
and so and so forth and what they've

1412
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:08,460
discovered over time is that allows

1413
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,740
hackers potentially if they can get in

1414
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,750
then they have access to much much more

1415
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,880
than they have access to previously when

1416
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,589
you had thousands of different kinds of

1417
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:18,599
networks you know before you went to one

1418
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:20,760
network right and so there's just

1419
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,470
there's always a trade-off between you

1420
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,750
know security functionality and

1421
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,089
usability and this is one case you know

1422
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:29,900
in which you know there's no perfect

1423
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,849
calculation of risk here but I would

1424
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:34,079
certainly recommend if you're just

1425
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,420
asking me personally that they diversify

1426
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,829
somewhat or that they try to have a

1427
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:39,150
unique environment I'm sure they're

1428
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,299
trying to do that for sure but is

1429
01:04:42,299 --> 01:04:44,220
perhaps not easy everybody wants to use

1430
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,569
windows because if the users are

1431
01:04:45,569 --> 01:04:47,160
familiar with it and they know how to

1432
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,559
use it and you put them on out on a

1433
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,510
Linux machine they may not feel

1434
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,750
comfortable etc but in this case it

1435
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,309
could be that the Siemens software works

1436
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,829
on windows only you know and that

1437
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:01,049
they're they're stuck in Iran with with

1438
01:05:01,049 --> 01:05:03,480
using industrial control system software

1439
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,279
that that only is compatible with

1440
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,670
Windows I don't know is it another

1441
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:11,000
question

1442
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:23,680
yes the plc i'm not sure but but

1443
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,650
originally that's right it was windows

1444
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:33,740
at the workstation all right we'll have

1445
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,569
one last short question and then we'll

1446
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:39,500
adjourn sure yeah you mentioned that

1447
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,930
with the stocks Nets it basically turned

1448
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,539
how we understand malware on its head

1449
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:46,460
with it being a more directed attack and

1450
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,730
you've also mentioned that we've started

1451
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,829
having multilateral agreements with

1452
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:53,630
organizations such as NATO on how to

1453
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,329
defend against these threats but apart

1454
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:59,329
from basically just words and policies

1455
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,730
do we have or is any organization or

1456
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:04,069
state actually starting to implement

1457
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:06,500
something on the ground to actually

1458
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,289
counter these emerging threats or do we

1459
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:10,849
have something like that in the words at

1460
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:12,650
the moment at the international level

1461
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,289
well not well it would be nice if it's

1462
01:06:15,289 --> 01:06:17,000
at an international level even at the

1463
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,710
local level if you would know any

1464
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,829
particular State or player that is

1465
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:24,260
already starting to address this beyond

1466
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,680
simply agreements with one another the

1467
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,559
critical infrastructure threat yeah sure

1468
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,539
I mean well in the United States I think

1469
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:35,500
like the us-cert now I think has a new

1470
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,119
body that's only focused on critical

1471
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,539
infrastructure really the oldest has

1472
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,869
been starting evidence since 1996 i

1473
01:06:44,869 --> 01:06:46,190
believe the United States the President

1474
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,500
Bill Clinton had this thing called PDT

1475
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,690
63 presidential decision directive 63

1476
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,660
witch named critical infrastructure you

1477
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:56,079
know and there was eight elements to it

1478
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,160
you know there was there was a loyal and

1479
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,200
gas and there was an electronic

1480
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,730
infrastructure and there was cetera and

1481
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,289
trying to look at it from a national

1482
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:08,119
security perspective in protecting these

1483
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:11,270
these eight sectors of the economy so

1484
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,770
that you know there's a lot going on I

1485
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,630
think the US was it was a little bit

1486
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:19,160
ahead of the game on this but from what

1487
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,109
I've seen ever since Stuxnet I saw in

1488
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:22,150
the paper last week

1489
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,740
the number of vulnerabilities discovered

1490
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,609
within critical infrastructure is

1491
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:30,160
doubling since Stuxnet so it has the

1492
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,490
attention now of hackers in a

1493
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:37,630
vulnerability researchers so you know I

1494
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,670
think there's a lot of work to you know

1495
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,849
with just at the beginning I think we

1496
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:45,220
had at the cyber center last year we had

1497
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,930
over 100 engineers at the Swedish

1498
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,210
equivalent of DARPA we put together an

1499
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:53,079
environment of seven electricity plants

1500
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:55,000
and we have it we ran a scenario we had

1501
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,069
20 hackers and they had the red team and

1502
01:07:57,069 --> 01:07:58,869
there were seven blue teams from

1503
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:00,430
different countries in Europe and they

1504
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,170
basically tried to attack the critical

1505
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,900
infrastructure and so you know so I have

1506
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,160
a paper on that published by Cal

1507
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,589
Berkeley and basically what we

1508
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:09,819
discovered was the hackers were quite

1509
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,710
good at getting into the infrastructure

1510
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:12,970
in the first place they weren't so good

1511
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:14,980
at understanding of control systems the

1512
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,109
but the thing is is that militaries and

1513
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:19,029
intelligence organizations they can

1514
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,130
bridge that gap right they put and put

1515
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,170
the same people in the room with

1516
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,640
somebody's an expert on vulnerabilities

1517
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,960
somebody on exploits somebody on

1518
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,270
encryption and then the engineers in the

1519
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,069
room that understand the control systems

1520
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:32,229
if you can put that group together in

1521
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:33,609
the room and all of a sudden you can

1522
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,710
have a national security threat but

1523
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,238
that's the kind of thing that alone

1524
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:39,429
hacker or even a terrorist organization

1525
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:41,890
might not be able to do I think that

1526
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,210
terrorist organizations are still more

1527
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:45,089
fearful of the internet than they are

1528
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:47,589
trying to exploit it and that's why for

1529
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:49,658
instance and Ibaka bod you know it was

1530
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:50,890
some in Laden's compound they didn't

1531
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,448
have chela phone or internet access you

1532
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:53,620
know because they feared the

1533
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:59,519
connectivity but there's a huge separate

1534
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,969
human the nation-state and everybody

1535
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:06,549
else in this game but as we've seen with

1536
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:08,710
anonymous boy you can you can affect

1537
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:10,330
international affairs even as a

1538
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,158
non-state actor if it's only on the

1539
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,270
semantic level or the WikiLeaks

1540
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:19,540
information provision level thank you

1541
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,040
very much Kenneth we will have to

1542
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,689
continue further questions on the floor

1543
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:24,158
feel free to approach a cannon during

1544
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,600
the coffee break which we are having

1545
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,960
right now
