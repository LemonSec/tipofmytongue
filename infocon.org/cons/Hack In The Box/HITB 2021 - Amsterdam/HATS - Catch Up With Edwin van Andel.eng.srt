1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,120
oh you're bro

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm good yeah how are you guys not too

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,480
bad

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,400
we're kind of enjoying this a little bit

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
of a studio thing but

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,320
you know even though it's not what we

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
watch

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
nothing it's i think it's a different

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,279
feel

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
it com it's similar to what you have in

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,119
a real world but in a smaller audience i

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,000
guess

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,079
right yeah i miss the interactions i

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,000
miss that you know when i do a talk now

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
to a screen i see myself

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
on my slides and that's it you know and

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
i i hate that

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
i want to see people i want to have fun

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,239
and do stuff

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
and that's nice not having the audience

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,480
energy right that that makes a big

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,840
difference man it's like you know you're

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
talking to your street you know it's

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,320

airport that's awesome did you know that

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,799
singapore airlines was doing a flight to

44
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,079
nowhere as if you could

45
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,439
board the plane and they would fly

46
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
around like airspace in singapore and

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
then land back again so just in case you

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,840
miss

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,320
airline food for whatever foreign wow

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
bring food home awesome that's really

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
awesome

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
yeah i know that a lot of those plants

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
laughing in the netherlands the food

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
they donated to people who don't have

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,640
that much money

56
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
so you could just get airplane food at

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
pickup places really cool

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,119
hey so bro what's been going on with

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,640
zerocopter man we heard you guys got a

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
new ceo

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
tell us a bit about that yeah well i

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,160
actually ordered myself a lot

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
i mean we're in a hacker scene now right

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
so i can tell the real story

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,680
now we started serial copter back in

66
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,160
2015 in 2017 i became the ceo

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
and and we just tried to adapt

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
zerocopter to what we thought was best

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,959
as hackers you know so

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
so get rid of all the sales stuff and

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
just focus on

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
actual products actual interaction with

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
the hacker community getting the best of

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
the best

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,599
and since 2017 that grew

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,800
basically very rapidly and we tried to

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
keep the echo 5 in and get

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
a lot of cool people on board and that

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
works but

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
i'm not a ceo who is good at numbers you

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,959
know or good at

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
i'm good at getting the right people in

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
and having fun and making sure

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,959
everybody's enjoying their sales being

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
creative building stuff you know that's

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
what i like

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
and we are now at a point where where we

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
could scale up

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
yeah even more than we are now and even

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
rapidly than we are now and i'm

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
i found myself in the last year being

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
busy with

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
finances and being busy with budgeting

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,400
and being busy with

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
pensions and we envisioned with you know

96
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,120
all the stuff that

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,519
i don't like it you know and and and

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,200
that's when the investors also said

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,799
maybe we should look for somebody who

100
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,560
knows how to scale

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
and um i said well basically a good idea

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,959
i can go back to the stuff i love i can

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,280
get the best people in and somebody else

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
is responsible for

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,080
investment stuff finance so i found it a

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
good idea but then

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,599
we got to talk to some ceos that were

108
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
placed to us so this is a good guy he

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
has a platform this is a good guy you

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,799
can do and

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
everyone i talked to i was like oh my

112
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,080
god

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
you know yeah it sucks because then i

114
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
asked the question what do you know

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,959
about cyber security and they were like

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
it's very important okay no

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
that's no match for we got a lot of

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,560
hackers here you know

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
and yeah admitted we we are fun people

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,400
but we are

121
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
also people who get distracted very fast

122
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
because we see something new that's

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
interesting people who

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
might not live up to hours they should

125
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
work or whatever you know

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,479
and and that's something you need to

127
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,880
cherish and not put in a box

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
and put a regular ceo on it so i want to

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,320
look at my own network and i knew that

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,919
klubmarker's eric was available

131
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,720
basically because he had some some

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
incidents at the previous company

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,840
so i just pinged him and i said are you

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
interested so we had a chat for like two

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,320
hours

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
um drank some club market and some

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
coffee of course

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
and then he was like i like this you

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
know i like the idea

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
this is real for him that that's

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,479
basically something new to have

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
actually a real company with real people

143
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,840
who might not be

144
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
commercial who might not be you know

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
outgoing or whatever but they are

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,639
brilliant and we have a link to the

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
community where we have billion hackers

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,600
in there so

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,440
he stepped in and then our investors

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
went like what

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
this guy no really this guy okay okay

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,320
you know

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
so they were very happy and that's when

154
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
i said okay talk to the team what do you

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,440
think i will

156
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
stay on board i'm still at in the board

157
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,880
as well so

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
together with him i make the new

159
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,280
decisions but he's just a guy who has

160
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
more experience in scaling and running

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
big companies but he has also has a

162
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
good history in cyberspeak from the day

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,840
he started he was in security basically

164
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,639
so

165
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
um that's very cool for us and he run a

166
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,080
direct

167
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
team at kpn and he ran fox it for a

168
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,319
couple of years so

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
he has a lot of experience in in all the

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
stuff that we are

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
yeah as a basically small hack community

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
not that experienced

173
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
so i'm really really happy that he

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
wanted to join and for me that's

175
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,080
something i wanted to hand over the

176
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
company basically but only to someone

177
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,720
where i knew

178
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,199
it would be safe and good and we would

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,440
have the same values and the same

180
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
stuff to to give to our hackers and to

181
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,199
give to our clients

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,800
and that's something we achieved so i'm

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
actually very happy

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
but the only thing is now he's just

185
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,960
started like two months ago

186
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
so what you see now is that i'm doing

187
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
double the role you know i'm not

188
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
i'm not the ceo anymore but i have to

189
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
work in a new ceo and i have to

190
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
help with getting everybody acquainted

191
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,479
to make sure that everything goes but on

192
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,080
the other end we serve the company to

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,199
run so

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
it's crazy but i can focus

195
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,680
on the amount of work that's going to be

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
needed but uh i mean it's important

197
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,560
right i mean culture

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
you you've built zero copters culture

199
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
over the years and then

200
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
and you cannot destroy just like that

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
right so if you have the wrong people

202
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,520
and then that's

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
then that's done you know so that's why

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
i i really fought hard

205
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,639
to make sure that we've got somebody and

206
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
what we all like and where we all have

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
faith in that that he will not

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
destroy the company and he won't you

209
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
know he loves the idea

210
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,919
and for him it's also fun because

211
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
normally he comes in the company where

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
there's a lot of hassle you know there's

213
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,479
like a

214
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,440
500 or 1 000 people working and people

215
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,120
are fighting with each other and he

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
comes in and he has to fix it

217
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
and here everybody was okay hi

218
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,360
everything is cool you know what do you

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
want to do and he was like

220
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
uh what do i have to do you know well

221
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
try to build it you know try to make it

222
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
grow try to think of new stuff

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
and he's actually already doing that so

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
that's really really cool

225
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,919
and we can just focus on on keeping the

226
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
teams together but also adding new

227
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,639
people

228
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
we had some awesome hires in the past of

229
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,000
course with

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,879
really talented people but yeah you know

231
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,360
when

232
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
people are really telling that they're

233
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
sometimes also structured in a

234
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,599
in a structure they create it for

235
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,240
themselves and then you can try to steer

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,639
them

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
yeah steer them in a suit or whatever it

238
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,400
won't work so

239
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,319
you have to do to make sure that you

240
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
understand it and he does so that's

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
really really cool

242
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
excellent so what what about you man i

243
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
mean what are you going to be up to now

244
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
that you're not ceo or not having to do

245
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
numbers and stuff i hate numbers myself

246
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,759
so

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
yeah it is

248
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
all the stuff with all the boards and

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
all the people doing finances they come

250
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,280
with like

251
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,519
excel sheets of pretty pages and i'm

252
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,640
like you know

253
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,880
you can do it on one this goes in this

254
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
comes out we need this

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,120
done you know and they're like no no no

256
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,080
no no

257
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
so yeah what i'm going to do now is well

258
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
first of all make sure that that error

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
glands good

260
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
and that we have the plans together for

261
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
the next years

262
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,600
so long-term roadmap uh helping the

263
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
teams wherever i can

264
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,440
at the moment to jump in in positions

265
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
that might be

266
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,360
well structurally moved you know because

267
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,000
yeah

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
we are a flat team and we have to grow

269
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
so that means that we have to

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
get people maybe a different position or

271
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,200
to

272
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,680
help make sure that the communication

273
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,920
lines are better or that some processes

274
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,279
get in place

275
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
so i'm doing that now mostly and then

276
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,200
afterwards i think

277
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
i hope i will go out again uh be on

278
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
page again um have fun with with my

279
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
community and the crew

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
and and that's what i hope to do and we

281
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
did that in the past years and for us

282
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
this worked perfectly you know every

283
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
time we are at the conference or at the

284
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,000
states there's always

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,680
something happening we always get some

286
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
attention or or build

287
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
trust or the brand you know and and

288
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,519
that's something you need i think

289
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,360
to make sure that you're true and we see

290
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
also a lot of interest from big

291
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,000
companies who

292
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,920
who lack this you know the the big

293
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
companies who have maybe a lot of fan

294
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,200
testers or whatever

295
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,320
but to the clients it's not coming over

296
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
as truly authentic

297
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
you know for instance they're well let's

298
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
say they're an accountancy firm and they

299
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
have a pentestine department

300
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
yeah the client knows that and they do

301
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
pen tests but it's not as

302
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
real as having a bunch of hackers come

303
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
help you you know and we try to be the

304
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
bridge between the community

305
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
and and the companies and make sure

306
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,720
that's something we we do

307
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
for the rest i'm also working on with

308
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,200
the police for instance

309
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
on uh hack right where we help kids who

310
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
done something wrong got a

311
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,240
the rare and and swipe the streets for a

312
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
punishment but

313
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,000
come to us and we'll explain how you can

314
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,399
do

315
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,320
responsible disclosure or how you can

316
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
even make money in security if you do

317
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
bug bounties or if you

318
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
train hard you can be from a red team or

319
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,200
whatever you know and we try to steer

320
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
them in the right direction so that's

321
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,839
something we do

322
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,720
we work with government regarding the

323
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
responsible disclosure policies or for

324
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,880
ordinary vulnerability disclosures

325
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
we do a lot of advice there and we even

326
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
helped to

327
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
make sure that the 2018 version of the

328
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
cpd policy in the netherlands was

329
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
renewed and and that it's now wider

330
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,079
spread

331
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,160
and companies have to work on that so we

332
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
do a lot for that as well to

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
just protect the hacker community

334
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
basically

335
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
and to make sure that people find each

336
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
other and that's something we can do

337
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,720
because we have all the

338
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640
the connections either in government

339
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,760
either in

340
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,920
in in companies or whatever but also in

341
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,079
the community and you often see that it

342
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:30,880
relax

343
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,720
you know somebody finds something wants

344
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
to report there's no

345
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,600
answer um people shout at each other

346
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
well if we can help there that works you

347
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
know and then everybody our main goal is

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
basically to have

349
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,720
uh hackers not in the news anymore as

350
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,760
criminals

351
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
you know just get them in there and let

352
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,399
the world see that we

353
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
love to break stuff but we also do it to

354
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,519
help

355
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,920
you know and if we can get that on stage

356
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,519
that that's awesome and that's

357
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
something we work very hard for and that

358
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,200
benefits everybody i think

359
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
you think that you know with the with

360
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,040
the kobe situation are your clients uh

361
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
are more asking more for hackers to come

362
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,639
and do stuff or

363
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,880
less and then like has it been an uptick

364
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
or you know are people still kind of

365
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
like well we'll call you when we need

366
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
you kind of thing

367
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
well yeah the problem is that um on one

368
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
side people

369
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
know they need it on the other side as

370
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
long as nothing happens they don't need

371
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,440
it

372
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
you know and and the idea of having a

373
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,880
hacker in

374
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,440
is for some companies still scary and

375
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
what we see is we work with a lot of uh

376
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
csos for instance

377
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,639
and they are they know that they have to

378
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,519
fix stuff

379
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,279
but they have of course limited budget

380
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,360
so they come to us and we explain how we

381
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
work that we have hackers around the

382
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
world we can

383
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,639
test you and we can help you with triage

384
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,440
and we can do

385
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,360
responsible disclosure triage for you

386
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,800
and they're super

387
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
super enthusiastic and they say let's do

388
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
this we're gonna work together

389
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
and then we make an offer and they say

390
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
fine i go to the board and then somebody

391
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,800
had bought it

392
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,320
hackers no no no this is not something

393
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,839
we do you know and then

394
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
we have to go again and it takes

395
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
sometimes to half a year to sign

396
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,399
something

397
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,440
but we see that people are getting more

398
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,480
interested and

399
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,440
and also getting the concept of having

400
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,200
hackers help you you know

401
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
and but it's it's a long long road to

402
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,880
get there

403
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,440
and that's difficult but do we see more

404
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,839
well not sure we see more bugs coming in

405
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,600
because that's yeah a lot of hackers are

406
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
mostly at home now and have maybe more

407
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
free time to

408
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,200
to do some bug hunting so we see that a

409
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
lot

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
and we see companies uh who work with us

411
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,440
actually

412
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
increasing all their scopes and

413
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
increasing the bounties and

414
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,040
and and getting the idea having more fun

415
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,399
knowing what it is but we

416
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
don't see well the the lower layer doing

417
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,440
something

418
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
and so that means for us in the

419
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
netherlands area it's it's

420
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
called the smaller companies basically

421
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,600
they're still not seeing they still

422
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
if they think about security they think

423
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
either of we have to buy a box with

424
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
lights and we put it in the network and

425
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,560
we're secure

426
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
that's one option and the other one is

427
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
we have a company who helps us

428
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,120
doing the network and do our stuff so

429
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,399
they must

430
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,040
uh make sure that we are secure and we

431
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,079
trust them

432
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
you know that's that's what those middle

433
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
companies do and and yeah that's

434
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
something that

435
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,399
will go away in the end because you

436
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,120
can't do it that way anymore

437
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
i i once did a talk at a conference

438
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
where there were 15 000 people

439
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
and they all had web ships they were all

440
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
little people with webs

441
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,760
or companies with webshop and there were

442
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,959
200 talks

443
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,120
during the two days and there was one

444
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,320
about security

445
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
that was mine and my room was

446
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
filled half you know and the rest was

447
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
how do i get my product

448
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,399
from a to b as fast as i can and as

449
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
cheap as i can how can i make sure my

450
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,639
site

451
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,639
looks brilliant and how can i make sure

452
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,160
i get money

453
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
those were the three subjects that

454
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,240
everybody went to and security

455
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
yeah and it's stupid because it's their

456
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
data you know they can say okay i host

457
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
it over there but you're

458
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,800
responsible for the data that's in your

459
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,920
systems

460
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
it's not some other company so and

461
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
people don't get it

462
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,800
and the reputation if there's an

463
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
incident yeah

464
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
you know you can say like yeah we hired

465
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,000
xyz company to help us with it but at

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,399
the end of the day

467
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,399
yeah you know it's still your reputation

468
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,000
right and in the netherlands it's

469
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
interesting because we just had some

470
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
some companies suing each other so

471
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
there was one company who had a bridge

472
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,240
and they sued

473
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
basically the company who helped them

474
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,360
make sure the networks were okay and

475
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
it's still a big discussion

476
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
you know it's really interesting is the

477
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,360
company that helps you responsible for

478
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
your security

479
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
i would say no because at the end of the

480
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,399
day they only advise you right

481
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,519
you're the one who has to actually still

482
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,519
sign up on whatever findings that they

483
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,000
have and

484
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,399
fix it because the findings is great but

485
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
who's gonna fix it

486
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
yeah true but if the company doesn't do

487
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,440
that and just sells you stuff and

488
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
doesn't basically care about what

489
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,440
happens

490
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
then who's responsible you know so it's

491
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,360
always vague and always a difficult

492
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
discussion

493
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
but yeah it's interesting to follow

494
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,360
and so what else is new man what else

495
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,959
what other fun stuff man any fun stuff i

496
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,480
heard you were doing a documentary you

497
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,759
mentioned something about documentary

498
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,680
the other day well i'm a member of the

499
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,680
guild of the grumpies as you might know

500
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:31,920
so

501
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
she loves the grumpies what the hell is

502
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,279
that oh you don't know

503
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
well in the netherlands like five years

504
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,639
ago we started

505
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
we had some elderly hackers because you

506
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,639
know we have a dog bounty with a lot of

507
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
younger haircuts

508
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
really awesome but we also have a big

509
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
group of elderly hackers like me

510
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
and we came together and we had fun and

511
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,399
then in the end we said maybe we should

512
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,240
do something together you know just

513
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
not not hang out when we see each other

514
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
at a conference but maybe do it once a

515
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
month or 152 months

516
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,279
so with a group of older hackers we

517
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,400
started

518
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
uh had some notes up from the second

519
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
awareness

520
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,640
dutch but it's stupid so in the end we

521
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,799
called it the guild of the grumpy old

522
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,679
hackers

523
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,400
and uh it's been growing we have members

524
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
in japan we have members in in

525
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
new york and they're all old hackers

526
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,720
like us

527
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,839
but all in the same vibe you know if

528
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,599
somebody tries to do something

529
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
if you see somebody shouting i have

530
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
found the database with credit cards we

531
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,320
help them

532
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
report it you know we try to steer the

533
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
younger community but on the other side

534
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
we also want to have fun so we also try

535
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
to break stuff that

536
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
everybody forgot basically so that's our

537
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,280
motto so

538
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
try to find stuff in your community or

539
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
do weird stuff so we actually once

540
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
tried to start a church yeah

541
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
because if you start a church in the

542
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
netherlands you have access to

543
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
data of people because you are allowed

544
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
to be in some sort of administrational

545
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,240
systems where everybody are

546
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,799
so we started shares to see if we can

547
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,240
get access as well

548
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,120
uh other stuff we did now it fits

549
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
right another stuff we did is like it

550
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,640
wasn't our dreams you know you can't

551
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
send basically

552
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
bugs at the cross border so okay we have

553
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,039
one guy standing

554
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
at the dutch border one in the german

555
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,840
border and we hand over a sheet of paper

556
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,480
with

557
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,440
zero day on it what will happen you know

558
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,919
all those

559
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,320
stupid things we try let's just scare

560
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,640
stuff up and get a discussion

561
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
and and and we also did that well the

562
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
trump stuff with

563
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,919
where we hacked the twitter account

564
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
twice with the guru peace and it was

565
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
not on purpose it was accidental but a

566
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,600
lot of

567
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
a lot of attention for that as well so

568
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
that's that's something we do in our

569
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,039
free time and it's

570
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
basically fun you know and with the

571
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,400
grumpies we

572
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,559
got a lot of media attention for the the

573
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
hacks on the trump twitter account

574
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,679
and then we were asked to work with a

575
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
documentary maker but

576
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
to make sure that it's not just a

577
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
documentary on hackers with hoodies and

578
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,880
blah blah blah

579
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
so we said okay we'll work with you but

580
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
we will also want to

581
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,039
make sure that this show processes so

582
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,080
what we actually

583
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
do now is is looking at a documentary

584
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,440
where we

585
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
follow some guys who do responsible

586
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,919
disclosures and basically film them and

587
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,280
don't use them

588
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
and then see how the process goes you

589
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
know how this company react how does

590
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,039
government react

591
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,559
um how are hackers treated what's the

592
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,320
struggle for us and

593
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
from that angle try to give the people

594
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
an image of

595
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,679
well it looks fun to be a hacker but

596
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,280
maybe it isn't or

597
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
our heck is criminals no way you know we

598
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,400
just help people to be more secure and

599
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,960
and

600
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
that's stuff we are working on now with

601
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
when is it coming out when is this

602
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
documentary is it on netflix or what man

603
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
no no no

604
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,120
actually in the netherlands it will

605
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
probably on video land and the dutch tv

606
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
and i'm not sure if netflix will will go

607
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,960
it but

608
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
it's still far from being out we're

609
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,320
still filming and we're still

610
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
making sure that that we do all the

611
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,280
right procedures and not disclose about

612
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
uh on tv before the company fixes it

613
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
but we're working on that so that's fun

614
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,480
stuff

615
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,159

on the couch yeah yeah yeah brilliant

636
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,760
idea because

637
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
when when i saw what you were doing with

638
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,679
the coffee i was like yes it did

639
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
you know this is something we all need

640
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,000
every hacker drinks coffee you know and

641
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
there's a lot of nice stuff institutions

642
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
but there's no haircut

643
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
so we need this that's why i immediately

644
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
contacted you and immediately

645
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
brought some stuff over you of course

646
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,480
but also for well you know at zerocopter

647
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,200
we have

648
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
the community we have connected we still

649
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
select by hand so we don't have like one

650
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
million hackers connected we only have

651
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,799
about 200 now

652
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,760
250 and we hand-picked them so hardware

653
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,799
hackers whatever

654
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
everything is in there but we all know

655
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
then we know they're the best of the

656
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,320
best so

657
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,039
get in there and we thought we we always

658
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,600
give them

659
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,760
stuff like t-shirts and you know but

660
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
this would be cool if you can get them

661
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,679
coffee and then you and i taught them

662
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,240
what if we make a xerocopter brand so

663
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,919
we're now in the process of

664
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,080
of yeah you have the brand ready of

665
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,240
making the designs and we did some stuff

666
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,159
but we're not quite there yet

667
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,640
but it will get there and then we will

668
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
make sure that every hacker connected to

669
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,799
us gets the coffee for free

670
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
so yeah so

671
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
everybody knows your name as well then

672
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,919
