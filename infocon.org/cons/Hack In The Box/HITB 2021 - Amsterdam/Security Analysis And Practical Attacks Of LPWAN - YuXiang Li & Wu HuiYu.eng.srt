i'm great to share some of the work

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
by our team on hacking about today

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
we will share some of the security

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,640
research findings of

you can visit our team website

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,799
let's take a look at the agendas first

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,520
of all

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
we will introduce the basic technologies

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
of lp1

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
related supply chains and the difference

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,720
between slola 1

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
and mblt in the second part we will

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,160
introduce the new findings of

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
lorawan security research as well as

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,599
our practice the third part will share

49
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,000
the internal implemented implementations

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
of mblt

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
ship and security risk

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
finally we will provide some security

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
advice to the regular wonder in the

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
rola1

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
and unbelt supply chain

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
in order to overcome the elimination of

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
soft rank protocol

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
low power wide area networks lp1 was

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
introduced

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,840
which offers a long range connectivity

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,360
in the in the orders of kilometers

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
it has low power and low bit rate for

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,560
long distance communication

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
the mainstream lp-1 technology include

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,720
lola mblt 64.

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
i present this communications

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
technologies has been widely used

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,239
including smart city

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
smart architecture smart industries

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
and so on which belong to the

71
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
application

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,760
senior scenarios of lp1

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
why did we choose to study the security

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,560
of lp1

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,200
according to the research of some

76
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,319
organization

77
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,280
it is printed just more than 1 billion

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
device

79
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,560
will be will be used lp1 technology

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
in the future among which lola and mbltv

81
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
occupied a large market share

82
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,480
at the same time compared with

83
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,040
zigbee bluetooth and other communication

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,159
technologies

85
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
the security research of lp1 is

86
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,519
relatedly

87
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
less with the large scale use of lp1

88
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
devices

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,319
security in this area will be very

90
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,798
important

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,040
okay let's introduce the two mainstream

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
technologies

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,199
involved in this topic lola1

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,680
and nblt first introduced lola

95
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,880
lola is a modulation technology used

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
in a physical laser that enable long

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,560
range

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,160
low power communication by using css

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
modulation it uses alliance frequency

100
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
bank

101
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
anyone can independently deploy the

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
network

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
blog one is a cloud-based media access

104
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,960
control

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,680
laser protocol but acts mainly as

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
networks laser protocol for

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
managing communication between lp1

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
gateways and nodes devices as a

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
routing protocol many by the

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
lola lions

111
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,039
mblg is a new iot technology set up by

112
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,080
3gbp

113
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
as a part of release 13.

114
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
although it is integrated into the lte

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
standard it can be regarded as the new

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,080
air interface it used the lion's

117
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
frequency

118
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
band which you same

119
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,080
frequency numbers used in lte and

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
exploit qpfk modulation

121
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
there are different frequency band

122
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
deployment

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
which are standalone

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
guard ban and invented this deployment

125
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,000
let's take a look at the supply chains

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
in lolawan

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,240
and mb iot in the real world

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
let's start with the ship lola patent

129
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,120
technology is dominate

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
mainly concentrates in zentash

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
there are more mblt chief vendors

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
including

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,520
qualcomm's meet media attacks and

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
high silicon all of which has deployed

135
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,639
a development deterrence shift

136
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,919
of their own architectures

137
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,199
then there is a model some major models

138
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
manufacturers such as ik

139
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,800
cortex blacks accumulate the shift

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
and capabilities they provide

141
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,680
through integration and git land to the

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
equipment manufacturers

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
equipment manufacturers will purchase a

144
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
large number of models for the

145
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
development of

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
end products for example waters and

147
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,479
electricity

148
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
matters dock window sensor and so on

149
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
liam when displaying the lp1 solution

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
you need to work with cloud windows of

151
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,360
operators to complete the deployment

152
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
at this point the whole solution is

153
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
fully deployed

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,120
and the schemes will be managed or

155
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
ultimately

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,720
with cloud data in a light later stage

157
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,520
before just in the real world a company

158
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
lp1 solutions

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
require the participation of many wonder

160
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
so we think that the security of lp one

161
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
supply chain

162
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
is worth starting

163
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
let's briefly compare the difference

164
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
between

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
lolawa and nblt

166
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
from the technological characteristics

167
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,520
because one is simply and easy to deploy

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
so in bad battle life

169
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
coverage cost efficiencies will be

170
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,240
better than

171
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
mblt on the concentrates mblt

172
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
is measured by traditional

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
telecom operators and refer to 3gpp

174
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,280
standard

175
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
so it's excellent in terms of latency

176
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,240
and security

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,960
select security is the voice of our

178
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,400
presentation

179
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,760
dollar one user ies one

180
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,440
as is security basic mblt is

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
current futures from lte which has

182
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
security

183
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,279
protections in is an ios

184
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,160
at the same time it uses sim cards as

185
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
authentication

186
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,839
which is relatedly more secure

187
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
let's take a look at the difference

188
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
between the two technologies

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
in network architectures first the lower

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
one device transmits data to the

191
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,320
gateways by radio the gateway is very

192
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
similar to the router

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
one side received product package the

194
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,839
other side

195
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,040
can access earth net through lte wi-fi

196
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
and other way

197
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
finally it reached the network server

198
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,040
and the solution managers can manage the

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,839
device

200
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
according to the application servers the

201
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,480
lola1 gateway is

202
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
easy to buy which is of great help of

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,800
our security research

204
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,959
mblt is quite different it is

205
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,880
it modifies versions of lte

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,399
therefore the device is connect to the

207
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
corporate operators networks through the

208
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
base station called e-node b in

209
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,399
lte an e-node b is intensity and

210
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,760
difficult to buy

211
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,959
and require in different knowledges of

212
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
radio before it can be displayed on

213
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,640
its own lens there is a core network

214
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,200
server

215
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
of operators mblt follows lt is a pc

216
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,560
which is a complete blackboard for earth

217
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
finally connect to the iot platform

218
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
through the network

219
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,320
manager can manage the equipment through

220
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,720
this platform

221
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
next let's take a look at the roller one

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,079
protocol

223
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,200
the whole protocol consists of two parts

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
the lola is responsible for radial

225
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
modulation

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,680
and deep moderation the max laser is our

227
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,640
fauce

228
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
according to the specification ruler 1

229
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
devices will be

230
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
deviced into 3 categories class 1 class

231
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,120
b

232
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
class c choose according to different

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,319
scenario

234
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
there are many keys in law one generally

235
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
speaking

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
the security basics of the protocol is

237
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
ies

238
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,560
the mbp key is stored in the nodes and

239
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
servers

240
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
used to generate the season key

241
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
network season key and application

242
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
season key are station key that

243
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
are used for encryption decryption

244
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
and mic gratification ruler one has two

245
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
ways to activate devices abp

246
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,079
and otaa abp can be understood

247
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,519
as a const system key

248
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
why ota conducts key negotiation

249
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,760
through ipp keys

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,120
the existing security studies of the two

251
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,000
technologies are mainly as follows for

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,880
lola one

253
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,560
the existing security issues are mainly

254
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760
protocol specifications and key

255
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,880
deployment the security issues of the

256
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,360
specifications

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
which has been fixed in the new version

258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
of the specification

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
but there are also great challenges in

260
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
using the new specification

261
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
in the real world the security risk

262
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
of other one deployment is usually uh

263
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,920
issues of security use of keys

264
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,600
at this stage it can be well served

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
by improving manufacturers security

266
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,680
awareness

267
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
and compliance operation as for mblt

268
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,120
there are few studies most of which is

269
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,839
surveys

270
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,839
of theory

271
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
we will not introduce the security rigs

272
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
of the protocol

273
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,600
specification in detail let's

274
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
take a look at the security states of

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,639
lolawan

276
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,040
device in the real world after our

277
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
analyze

278
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
it is generally divided into two types

279
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
of wonders

280
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
one type of wonder is already aware of

281
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,320
the security

282
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
risk associated with nodes deployment

283
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
lab every key is usually a random key

284
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
of one or one machine one key

285
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
which great guarantees that security

286
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,360
risk

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
of the network in addiction they also

288
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,360
provide guidance of hardware security

289
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
a types of wonders due late security

290
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,440
awareness

291
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,959
in order to facilitate

292
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,560
deployment the url use the send adb key

293
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,760
or welcome no every key or marks the id

294
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
keys on the device cells

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
in plain text of serial code

296
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,120
at the same time there is not enough

297
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,000
attention

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
to the to to the protections of

299
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,240
javiers and von beers we believe that

300
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
in more and more wondrous pay attention

301
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
to the security of lolawang

302
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
these problems will be solved so design

303
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
these security

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
risks what other dollar one security

305
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,560
issues

306
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,959
has not received enough attention

307
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
now we will introduce our new

308
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,639
discoveries in the lolawan supply chain

309
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
nani lulata this is a security issues

310
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,279
involving the supply chain which has not

311
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,320
received attention in previous studies

312
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
there risk occurs in nodes gateways

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and cost service net we will introduce

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
the implementations of the rollawan

315
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,519
supplement chain

316
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,000
and existing attack surface and our

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,639
practice

318
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,440
rule of arm many loloma has many open

319
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,079
source implementation and these

320
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,440
implementations are

321
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
actually used in the real world this

322
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:20,959
line

323
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,600
is several of the projects involved in

324
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,480
our study

325
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,519
including the lower one protocol stack

326
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,720
database and servers this

327
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
open source project can help a better

328
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,680
understanding the lower one solution

329
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,959
at the same time it is index a project

330
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,360
that

331
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
is being used in the real world

332
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,639
let's take a look at the architectures

333
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
of the lulava node

334
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,440
products on the marquee urge

335
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,079
have two architecture the first is the

336
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,480
mpc

337
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,519
mcu plus radio mode

338
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
this method is low cost and the

339
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
application and lola1 protocol stacks

340
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
running and run runs in this

341
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
mcus and operate videos to send radio

342
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,920
packets

343
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
the other is the ways of adding models

344
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,120
to

345
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120
external mcu at this point mcuary only

346
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
runs application on rtos

347
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,959
the works on the protocol stacks and

348
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,079
radio operation is integrated into the

349
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,040
model

350
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,639
and the model wonders will also add the

351
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,759
parts of the it library

352
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,800
but regardless of the architecture we

353
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
find that

354
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
the knowledge1 protocol stacks is an

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,279
essentials common components the most

356
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,399
widely used protocol stack is lola1

357
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,920
lola mcnull this is why we started in

358
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,880
this surveyor

359
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
ruler gateway as similar to protest

360
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,119
package forwarders components are purely

361
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
running on linux

362
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
the package portal components reach the

363
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,079
lola1 packet through the drivers

364
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,520
encapsulate the data

365
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,240
into the specific protocol and send it

366
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
to the network server

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
packing from another component including

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,199
petit formatter

369
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
basic extension and qtd and so on

370
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,200
hardwares need to be connect to the

371
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,600
sx1301 to

372
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
operate lola radio packet for example

373
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,679
the architectures of the ik 831

374
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
gateway shows that it is based on

375
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,320
recipe pi connect to sx1301

376
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,399
through a computer spawn

377
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
the mainstream level 1 servers are

378
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
club stacks and tdn both of which can be

379
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
used for private

380
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
deployment in addition tdn provides

381
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
public service

382
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
that allow anyone to build lola one

383
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
solution

384
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,679
the two architectures are as follows cut

385
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,960
stacks on the

386
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,160
left and tdns on the right in january

387
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,520
they all include several components mqtt

388
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
broadcast

389
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
network server application server

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
database

391
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
interaction communication between these

392
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,360
components

393
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:43,840
use mqttg rpc http and other protocols

394
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
after introducing the technology

395
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
implementation

396
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,080
in the real world let's summarize the

397
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,600
security rates of lolawan supply chain

398
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,160
on the node we can pay attention to the

399
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
vulnerabilities

400
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,480
of the lola mechno

401
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,679
which is widely used software on the

402
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,480
gateway

403
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,880
we can pay attention to the security

404
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,840
issues of different packet

405
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,919
forwarder on the server

406
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,240
they are all writing in gold launch so

407
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
we can function the security risk

408
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
introduced by the default configuration

409
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,120
and

410
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,840
open source code

411
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
first of all let's do the security

412
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
analyze of

413
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,200
lola mechano the software is

414
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,240
developed by centas and it

415
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
widely used more packet

416
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,440
person needs to know aes key which

417
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
we think will be very difficult in

418
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,799
future

419
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,760
therefore our focus is on the logical

420
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,039
before

421
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
participating in the ies operation

422
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,840
and this part of the code is very simple

423
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,840
but fortunately we found a vulnerability

424
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,840
the vulnerability is caused by nolan

425
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
fails fail to verify whether the

426
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,880
packet length is managed when processing

427
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
joint accept respond tacky the

428
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,720
vulnerability

429
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,039
exists in the process of rta

430
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,240
which can cause harm to the devices

431
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
that are joining the network but this

432
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
fly project

433
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
is necessary to redraw the network

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
which need to be combined with other

435
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
attack methods

436
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,360
the obvious advantage of this

437
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,520
vulnerability is that we can launch

438
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,799
attacks without

439
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
losing the ibp key and achieved a

440
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
widespread denial of surveys by sending

441
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,959
malaysia radio packet

442
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,760
so how do we send radio packets

443
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
because of the low power consumption of

444
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,600
lp

445
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,799
they are not always online so attacking

446
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,000
such device

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
require a specific cycle

448
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,080
the received windows of class a devices

449
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,840
is defined in the roller one

450
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
specifications

451
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
after the device sending uplink package

452
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,840
to stop receiving windows will be open

453
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
and the lower package will be browse

454
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,679
that

455
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,840
only when it is received in the

456
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,520
receiving window

457
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,760
in addition the dangling channel is also

458
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
different in different areas for example

459
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,600
in cn 407

460
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,039
rx1 channels number equals

461
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,080
uplink channel number mod

462
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,879
48

463
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
therefore after calculating the

464
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,039
appreciate

465
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,520
delayed and channel you can really

466
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,080
launch an

467
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,399
attack

468
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
after having the ability to send

469
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
malicious video package

470
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,600
we can select some displayment

471
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
box as the environment for local map

472
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,159
lola mechano debugging we can

473
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,880
choose the

474
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
we can choose listed p and ucleo's

476
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,120
as the taxing attacks equipment which

477
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
provides mcu expansion boards

478
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
and stick link whereas code

479
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,880

480
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
software

481
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
this deployment list development

482
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,799
box is very suitable for debugging the

483
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,320
protocol stack

484
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,039
can help us quickly verify the

485
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,840

486
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,159
when everything works ready we choose a

489
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,880
the attack follow is as follow

490
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,559
when the temperatures sensor stands are

491
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,320
uplink lta package

492
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,159
our hijackers to need the radio package

493
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,280
and notify the local server after

494
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
calculating the downlink channels and

495
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,400
delayed

496
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
the local server send the malicious

497

498
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
the hijacker sends it to the device

499
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,640
after the

502
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,559
the sensors resist malicious package

503
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,640
triggered related vulnerability

504
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
and device denial of service the box

505
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,840
is the pic practice of the

506
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,320
lola methanol vulnerabilities we found

507
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
in the actual

508
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,799
devices we believe that lower one

509
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,200
equipment is used very much and is

510
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,679
mostly used in unattention scenarios

511
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,320
such as smart city and agriculture

512
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
even denial of service has a great

513
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
inspect

514
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,200
next let's take a look at security of

515
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120

519
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,799
folders

520
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,760
compared with traditional components it

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,720
is used to upgrade basic station

524
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
and the practical formats generally

525
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,000
including

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,080
include length and data

527
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,320
lns use websocket to

528
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
establish and long connections

529
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,279
with the server and the servers

530
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
can send data to the gateway in

531
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,600
theory if ltls

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,840
pending is you it will be safer

533
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
after our analyze we believe that there

534
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,679
are many security risks

535
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,159
in this component which may lead to

536
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,279

hijacking of malaysia servers the main

540
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,320
risk

541
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,919
are as follows first

542
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,960
this component does not

543
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,559
enable authentication mode by default

544
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,120
so a lack of security awareness of the

545
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,679
displayers may lead to mi

tn hijacking second

547
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,400
the lns protocols contains the problem

548
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,720
for

549
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
capability and maybe

550
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
and risk of a bath the service

551
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,600
is fully truth in the lns protocol

552
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
therefore even if ltls

553
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
is enabled a malicious server can still

554
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,200
advance the capabilities of the lns

555
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,080
protocol

556
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,320
such as the remote exception

557
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,240
so cups

558
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
itself has memory of logical

559
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
vulnerabilities

560
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,279
when processing the data which can lead

561
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,159
to

562
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
security risk

563
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,960
risk of a blast of l1 as capability

564
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,720
we learned that we learn from the

565
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,960
documentation

566
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,559
that lns contains remote commands

567
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,240
also it is helpful for remote managers

568
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
of gateways

569
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,039
we believe that it may be above

570
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,080
and leave to security risk therefore

571
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,120
we can rce by hijacking of malicious

572
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,760
server

573
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,880
to stem package to the gateway component

574
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
for example in the pictures on the left

575
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,600
we create a plain text pun

576
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,000
dot tx t files on the gateway

577
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,360
find above lns

578
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,159
capability

579
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,440
next we will share the security rights

580
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
of the servers the default

581
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
configurations of clutch deck

582
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,279
is a security risk if the server

583
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,320
displayer

584
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,039
does not reach the instructions calf

585
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,080
raise or does

586
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
not have security awareness

587
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,159
it will lead to this risk of an attacks

588
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
on the server

589
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,880
for example the divorce weak

590
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,960
passwords may be used in the

591
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
database map

592
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,760
if an attack can enter the web service

593
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,360
of the application servers with a weak

594
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,799
password we can obtain sensor

595
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,760
sensitive device information such as

596
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,559
device a

597
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,760
app key and so on in addition some

598
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
mqtt and grpc surveys are not

599
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,000
authenticate which can lead to

600
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
permissions

601
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,279
of data disclosed we verified

602
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,520
this security risk in april last year

603
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,960
a few days later we share which

604
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
researched the current networks and

605
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
found that the

606
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,159
deployment of crafty servers sold

607
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,000
a growing chain the security risk

608
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,480
our work of our attention

609
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,080
mqtt integration is usually used by

610
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,360
manager to manage the dis

611
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,600
deploy lola1 solution in the

612
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,720
default configuration of nkltd broker

613
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,159
the url nand passwords and acls are

614
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
optional therefore incorrect

615
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
configurations may bring the

616
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,399
following security risk attackers can

617
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,080
subscribe to any topic through

618
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,679
wildcard in this way

619
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,440
the data is of the interaction between

620
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
the devices

621
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
and the servers can be obtained

622
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,279
including divide information after

623
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
knowing the device information the

624
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,480
attack

625
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
can also forage downlink data

626
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,640
and send it to the nodes through mqtt

627
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,960
in addition we found a bug in udp

628
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,679
postings logicals of the nullar one

629
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,279
stack code

630
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
sending a malicious udp package

631
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,600
caused the server to crash when the

632
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,720
gateway id

633
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,399
is known there is also a way to attack

634
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,360
the server

635
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,640
because servers are deployed by golang

636
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,039
memory vulnerabilities are real so

637
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,480
you can pay attention

638
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,760
to logical vulnerabilities

639
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,799
there may be some unexpected discoveries

640
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,240
after introducing the security risk of

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,399
all of one supply chain we will share

642
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,440
some research finding about mblt

643
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,559
similarly we will also introduce some of

644
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,360
our current

645
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,200
attempts in terms of technological

646
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,519
implementation attack surveys surface

647
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,320
analyze

648
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
and practice

649
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,840
let's start with an overview of mblt

650
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,640
shift

651
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,159
mblt shifts are highly integrated

652
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,960
url slc it contains different shift

653
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,880
architecture and rtos in addition

654
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,399
the mblt protocol is far more complex

655
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,440
than

656
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
ruler 1 the entire product stack

657
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,799
includes

658
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,880
baseband tcp ip and application

659
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,519
the base bank includes the physical

660
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
levels of unblt

661
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,840
and the up laser follows the protocol of

662
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,919
lte finally

663
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,039
in the ambiatic number there are black

664
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,159
box in the

665
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,919
epc emb iot cloud platform

666
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,480
which bring a lot of challenges to the

667
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
security research

668
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
next we will introduce some findings in

669
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,919
the

670
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600

671
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,399
of mbilt chief

672
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,880
we will introduce you from two

673
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
mainstream

674
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,960
manufacturers

675
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,760
next we will introduce two mbl t-shirt

676
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,080
architecture first of all let's

677
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
introduce the

678
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,799
ship architectures of a is a

679
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,240
multiple course architectures each code

680
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,799
using

681
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,000
arm context and zero

682
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,480
the freeze costs are used for different

683
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,919
purpose and each course has

684
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,760
its own rtos for task scheduling

685
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,240
core a contains the application laser

686
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,320
protocols in the tcp ip protocol stack

687
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,279
such as dtls clap

688
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,360
lwm2m in addition

689
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,799
is also including the application laser

690
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,760
which is used to provide model vendors

691
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,080
to

692
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,360
display developers

693
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,480
the corresponding i.t libraries of

694
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,159
application development

695
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
adps can only provide 80 commands

696
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,240
interface

697
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,600
so that external mcu can

698
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,720
interact with mblt ship

699
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,559
of models directly through at command

700
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,760
in this way the developments of the

701
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,880
application is

702
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
mainly focused on the external

703
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,519
mcu copy

704
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
mainly deal with low level protocol

705
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,080
including baseband such as nis

706
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,440
rc l2 l1 related to

707
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,039
mblt they use and use

708
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,720
lwip as the tcp tcpip protocol step

709
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,239
to provide socket writers function

710
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,359
for course a core c

711
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,159
is mainly to provide some security

712
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,520
capabilities

713
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,560
including the security checked

714
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,599
needs by security book fota

715
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,639
and so on the manufacturer

716
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
involves a set of rpc mechanisms

717
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,760
which use share memory to realize the

718
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
inter

719
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,440
working of data between course

720
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,199
the other shift architecture is

721
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,159
displayed in a single course way

722
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,199
takeship b as an example which

723
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,879
use arm cortex m4 the entire core

724
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,320
is divided into two domains including

725
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
the application

726
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,839
demand and model domain

727
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
it is very similar to the

728
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,440
divisions of ap and moderns in mobile

729
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
form each domains use

730
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,079
a different rtos for task scheduling

731
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,960
the application demands include the

732
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,880
entire tcp product

733
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
stack and the apple application

734
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,359
compared with shift a we also

735
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,800
use the lwip libraries

736
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
after tcp ip protocol stack

737
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,800
experimentation

738
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
but it belongs to the app

739
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,240
application demand together

740
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,400
with the upper laser protocol

741
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,680
modern domain is mainly related to

742
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
baseband processing the two domain

743
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,920
communicate

744
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,040
with each other by share credit

745
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,400
put loader is also included in this

746
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,520
course similarly the adp

747
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
letter in in the application domain can

748
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,680
provide only the id command interface

749
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,760
for external mcu to operate through the

750
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
id command

751
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
after our reserve analyze we found that

752
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
even through different wonders adopt

753
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,119
different

754
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
architecture but some technological

755
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
implementations are similar we summarize

756
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,839
the attack surface of ambient iot shift

757
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,880
there are three categories the first

758
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,680
category is related to tcpip

759
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,000
which may use the stand surpassed

760
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,119
libraries

761
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,640
or implement specific logical

762
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,760
based on the stand standards the other

763
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,000
is

764
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,880
related by spam via the technology

765
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,800
experimentation is related to ship

766
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,440
vendors each of which has its own

767
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,079
implementations and will not use open

768
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,680
soft library

769
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,880
libraries it's more difficult to

770
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,400
find these kinds of soviet vulnerability

771
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,680
another category is the risk of

772
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,680
intercourse communication and

773
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,279
inter-demand communication

774
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,880
most of the codes we mentioned was

775
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,680
belong to

776
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,520
ship manufacturers mod

777
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,920
model manufacturers mainly words in apps

778
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,880
in addition to the attack surface

779
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,320
introduced here

780
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,560
the application processing logical

781
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,640
display

782
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
developed by the equipment

783
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,760
manufacturers will also have security

784
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,800
risk

785
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,040
but because the program developed

786
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
by the equipment manufacturer is

787
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
not a common commander we will not

788
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,920
introduce it here if you want to attack

789
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,880
programs

790
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,079
developed by equipment vendors

791
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
you can choose wonders with a high

792
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
market share

793
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,599
because the ambiance shift is highly

794
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,720
integrated

795
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,520
and the technology is closed it is

796
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,880
difficult for us to

797
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,400
purchase the

798
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,440
evolution voice of the trees for

799
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,480
department

800
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,520
therefore we can only get the running

801
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,040
status of the chief by lock

802
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,440
and debug it has provide useful software

803
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,000
to view

804
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,520
locks through the lock we can see

805
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,640
some output inside the chip including

806
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
the space

807
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,839
of the base bank the output applications

808
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,280
and so on is a little helpful

809
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,119
for us to understand the problem flow

810
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,599
and verify software availability

811
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,960
so how do we send package to the mblt

812
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
ship

813
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,960
we made some attempts different texting

814
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,920
to

815
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,040
adopt according to different protocol

816
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,000
stacks

817
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,839
if it's a tcp ip related test

818
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,040
we use recipe pi

819
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,200
ec 2 0

820
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,560
and iot sim card to assess the network

821
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,680
for testing

822
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,880
for baseband related tests sdr

823
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
and test sim cards can be used for

824
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
testing

825
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,800
we can use open source project for

826
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,520
testing

827
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,800
but the capabilities is not very good

828
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,520
at present

829
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,839
at the same time we can also buy a brt

830
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,760
base station for testing

831
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,680
but it is not easy there are still many

832
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,800
challenges to overcome throughout

833
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,800
the testing process and if you have

834
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,280
some similar words you can also

835
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,359
communicate via

836
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,800
okay my part is over the following time

837
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,680
will be

838
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,359
shared by my teammates

839
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
thanks i will continue to share the

840
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,200
following parts

841
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,079
in this part i will provide some

842
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,520
security suggestion

843
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,960
about the lp1 smaller team

844
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,160
i hope this suggestion can help the

845
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,200
winters to improve their products

846
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
security

847
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
and they can make a small contribution

848
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,160
to the community

849
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
of everyone

850
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,280
[Music]

851
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,800
of foreign stack or development

852
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,079
and the development and the development

853
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,400
of

854
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,760
getaways itself either to

855
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,880
be higher qualification and encouraging

856
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,040
many wavelengths the selves provider

857
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,319
should clear the weak password

858
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,440
enable authentication and validate

859
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,839
the input data with the open port

860
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,359
for mbiot we believe that

861
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,079
the chief all model vendors should

862
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,720
update

863
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,839
third party networks of or

864
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,160
trip when we are in a tiny manner

865
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,760
when using a corp and mkgt

866
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,640
as a communication protocol t-a-r-t-a-s

867
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
and authentication should be absorbed

868
