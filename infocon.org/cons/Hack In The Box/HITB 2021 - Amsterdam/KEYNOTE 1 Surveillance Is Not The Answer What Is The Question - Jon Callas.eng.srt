1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,280
this

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
is what i was going to be talking about

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
last year in the keynote

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
and as we all know it didn't happen

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,840
so this year going to talk again

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,000
ironically the talk may be a little

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
bit more relevant now because there have

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,440
been

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
ongoing developments in these sorts of

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
things that i'm going over

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,239
even like you know a few days ago i'm

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,840
going to mention things that

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
that that have happened so

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
what i really want to do is i want to to

15
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,320
try to inspire you to

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
new things and opportunities that are

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
ahead

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
i got into information security

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
before i was doing that i had done

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
community research i was my first

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,720
startup in the early 90s was in fact

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
doing meetings and the like over the

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
internet

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
and working on how you construct

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
spaces for people to do things and

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
before i did security at all of any sort

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
i did user experience

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,560
and um i have recognized that these are

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
things that have become relevant again

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
and while i enjoy doing infosec and

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,119
cryptography

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,479
these past things that i used to do have

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
shown me that the

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
reason that i like security which is

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,640
that

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
i like the interactions that people do

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,079
with computers

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
and security is all of the interesting

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
rough edges

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,920
it is the hard problems the difficult

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,119
things that we

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
need to do to try to figure out how to

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,079
act well together while we share

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
things and i think that

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,878
we are moving so that

46
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,239
the next opportunity is in fact that

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,319
human beings are wonderful and human

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,000
beings are awful

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
and it's just a way we are

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
and the technology that we have been

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
using to build

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,319
communities is also the technology that

53
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,120
we use

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,720
for constructing all sorts of other

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
things that aren't particularly good i

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,040
mean

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,560
right now for example um my group has

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:36,959
been

59
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
studying boss wear student wear

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,640
proctor wear stalker wear all of these

61
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
things

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
have a unification underneath them

63
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,599
and also in a lot of cases the hacking

64
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,599
tools that people use the same things as

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
debugging tools

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
this isn't a surprise to any of us

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
because you know the same tools that you

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
use to

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,720
say reverse engineer something are the

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
tools that you use to debug it

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
and there are other dualities like that

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
if you have a disc go bad and you need

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
to get your holiday pictures off of it

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,280
this is the same sort of thing

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
as as doing forensics on the disc to

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,720
find other things so all of these

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
technologies are in fact

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
dual use so

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
what i want to talk about is really

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,319
going up the stack

81
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,080
from software to human beings to

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
the stuff that runs in our heads and

83
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,599
one of the things that has been going on

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
is that the way that we have constructed

85
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,319
interaction on the internet with

86
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
user experience with community building

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
have led us to where you know for

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,360
example if i say oh i was having a lot

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,439
of trouble on the hell site today

90
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,799
you even know what site it was

91
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,680
and so what do we do about this can you

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
know can we

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
can we use the skills that we have

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
as hackers as infosec people

95
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,640
to make things better because the

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,760
hacker mentality the infosec mentality

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
the ability to look at things and say

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
what's going to go

99
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
wrong and predict it and fix things

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
before the problems occur

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
are in fact skills that the world at

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
large needs

103
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
so we need you we need the mad

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
skills that we all have and there's also

105
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
the opportunity for people who find this

106
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
interesting to learn new skills and work

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,919
with people who have them

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
there are lots of ux people there are

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
lots of community builders out there who

110
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,560
know

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,880
what they think they should be doing but

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
they don't have the same sort

113
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,759
of problem discovery skills that we have

114
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
and from a personal development point of

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
view this is new areas with unsolved

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,600
problems

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
you know i got into cryptography because

118
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
when i was doing

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
stuff like this collaboration on the

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
internet there was no ssl

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
and people said oh i don't really want

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,039
to like talk about my secret plans

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
when somebody could just sniff them on

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
the internet and that's what brought me

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
into cryptography and it's been a whole

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,639
lot of fun to do security since

127
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
but i also believe that the forefront of

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
what's going on for the next

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
10 15 years is going to be all about

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,080
how we do ux and community building

131
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
to make better systems for people

132
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
themselves

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,919
so how do we build systems so that

134
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,000
people don't exploit other people

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,400
especially the non-experts the

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,199
vulnerable

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
the easily exploited and

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
we've made a lot of progress despite the

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
fact that we have a tendency to

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,960
look at things and say everything is

141
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,639
still broken

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
it wasn't that long ago when it was

143
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
a truism of security that physical

144
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
access was

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,919
all that if somebody got to touch a

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,880
device

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
that they would own it and we are at a

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
point now

149
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
where many of the devices that we have

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,680
the things that we carry in our pockets

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,000
and

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
and and under our arms are

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
good enough that it would take a nation

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
states to break them

155
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
there's more work that can be done but

156
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
this has been great progress

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,800
it was considered two

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
three decades ago utterly impossible

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
that we could get this far

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
so we want to keep

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,319
the progress that we've made advance the

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
progress that we've made but we also

163
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,280
want to talk about

164
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,080
how we start working on the humans

165
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,759
themselves

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
and that brings me to my segway to

167
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
the crypt awards

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
you know this hasn't changed in like 25

169
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,160
years

170
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
the stuff that we were saying in the mid

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,520
90s is the same sort of things that

172
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
we're saying now

173
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,120
and i spent a few years just being i

174
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
don't want to talk about it

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,080
and thinking about the issues that i'm

176
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,560
going to be talking about now

177
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
that there are new opportunities got me

178
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
reinvigorated

179
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,039
so so what we're going to be doing here

180
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
what i'm going to talk about

181
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,680
is in fact what has gotten me excited

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
about what is new now

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
and wasn't there this time there's a

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
whole bunch of changes

185
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,560
in in the previous crypto wars

186
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,840
encryption was controlled

187
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,759
governments thought they owned it and we

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,280
wanted to use it

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,879
the early people who built things like

190
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
whit dithy marty hellman and others

191
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
build cryptography because they saw

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,759
the internet coming and they saw that

193
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,199
when everybody was connected

194
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,000
over networks that that you needed to be

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,879
able to have

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
cryptography there because that was

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
going to be the only thing that was

198
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,599
going to be

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
make it workable and so now we're at the

200
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,919
situation

201
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,280
where we have strong cryptography

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
we have good security and

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
the other side the side that wants a

204
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,240
surveillance state

205
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
wants it closed but we have the status

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
quo right now

207
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,879
and that is very different nonetheless

208
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,759
just like before they're saying we can

209
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,719
only stop

210
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,519
bad things through surveillance we know

211
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,919
that this is wrong

212
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,799
they have changed their focus so that

213
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,519
they are not

214
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
after vpns they're not after ssl

215
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,440
they're after primarily person-to-person

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,160
chat

217
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,880
person-to-person communication like this

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
a certain amount of device security

219
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
and also what goes on on social media

220
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,080
which

221
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
really isn't terribly well protected

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
anyway but

223
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,160
there's starting to be a blur between

224
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,800
them

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
there are lots of systems

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
like whatsapp telegram signal that

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
are straddling a line between a texting

228
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
system a chat system

229
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
and a social network the other thing

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
that is happening is that the internet

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
has made a bunch of bad things

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
differently bad than they were in the

233
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
pre-internet days

234
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,279
child abuse missing disinformation

235
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
inflaming hatred these are real problems

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,240
but they're also the excuses that the

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
forces of surveillance

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
want to be able to break into the

239
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,800
security

240
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,080
that we all need and

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,240
while surveillance is not the answer

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
i've given that talk before

243
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
you've heard that talk before and we'd

244
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
all be bored if i gave it again

245
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,120
so that's why i am wanting to go into

246
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,000
thinking about

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
new things and new ideas

248
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,560
and new ways to explore

249
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
the frontiers of technology and human

250
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,320
interaction

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,440
for the 2020s and beyond

252
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
another proviso that i have is in fact

253
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
that we're not going to convince them

254
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
i'm not going to try

255
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,839
they are not helping a lot of case or

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,760
they're blocking the problem

257
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
they there are ways to solve some of

258
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,839
these things

259
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,680
um plain old police work

260
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
community building on the ground and

261
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
their desire for the magic rainbow

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,480
unicorn key is not going to go extinct

263
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
they're still going to want it and it

264
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
just doesn't

265
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,839
exist any more than unicorns do

266
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,480
and we also know that security is hard

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
the stuff that i'm talking about

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
similarly to what we know from software

269
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,079
and device

270
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,399
security you can't just go sprinkle the

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,399
magic security dust on the problem and

272
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
it goes away

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
just like attacks went from simple

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
buffer overflows

275
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
to drop and drop attacks use after

276
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,079
freeze

277
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,760
and so on we're going to have to

278
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,519
address the person-to-person security

279
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,279
things

280
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,720
through a variety of means and

281
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
that's also why i think it's interesting

282
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,279
is that there's a whole lot of stuff

283
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
that we can be doing

284
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
and each time we make a little step

285
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,320
forward

286
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
we can try something else and gradually

287
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
as we have been doing in other sorts of

288
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,720
security

289
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
make things better but it's going to be

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
a long haul

291
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200
so let me talk about the way forward

292
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,200
um i i like

293
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
i like gifts but i find that gifts in

294
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
talks distract the hell out of me

295
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,200
this is the only one i'm going to get

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,519
this is where i'm putting my axioms

297
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
in my background as a pure mathematician

298
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
and philosophy person has me think about

299
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,279
things where

300
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
you know what are my basics what is

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
given that i'm not going to give up on

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and what are the principles that i use

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,120
to go forward

304
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,560
and the two things that i want to talk

305
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
about that is just given

306
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
is talking to another human being

307
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
in private is a basic human right

308
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,160
end-to-end encryption is how we do that

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
we've been sitting at home for the last

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,279
15 months

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
and it's much clearer to everyone now

312
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
that we need to be able to have

313
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
private spaces for people to talk to

314
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
each other no matter where they are

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,279
in the world because it's

316
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,839
just the way that things got to go and

317
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
also

318
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,519
a robot spy is a spy arguably the robot

319
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,079
spy is worse than a human spy

320
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,959
because it doesn't even have the sort of

321
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
human intelligence to do

322
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,720
any sort of mitigations on what they

323
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,360
want

324
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
so you need to have

325
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
person-to-person communication we want

326
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,920
no spies even robot spies

327
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,880
so i want to look at ways that we can

328
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
look at systems that are

329
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,800
that that could be built and that people

330
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
are building

331
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
what makes them desirable what makes

332
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,639
them undesirable

333
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,600
what governs the really interesting

334
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,320
space

335
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
in the middle where there's a really

336
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,680
good idea and you could do this right or

337
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,959
you could do this wrong

338
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
so we want to think about how you do it

339
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,199
right and what would be the places that

340
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
we don't want to go

341
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,839
because that's how we're going to

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,839
build the brain level security systems

343
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,079
that we need my first principle is

344
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
is it voluntary you know are you doing

345
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,000
this because you because you decided

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
to this is this is consent that

347
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,480
a a system that people have consented

348
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
to something that you've affirmatively

349
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,360
turned on yourself

350
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,880
is really good and in my security

351
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
and privacy practices that i've done

352
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
if someone says this is a voluntary

353
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
system they have to turn it on to make

354
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,600
it work

355
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
i'm going to look at it in a different

356
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,839
way than if it

357
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,800
was mandatory and similarly

358
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,920
if it's opt out rather than opt-in

359
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
it's kind of in the middle where you

360
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
need to look at it closely but at least

361
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,839
the people who don't like it can turn it

362
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,000
off

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
and where you have opt-in and opt-out

364
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
for different situations is part of

365
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,920
what the whole building things in

366
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,519
constructing them is because there's

367
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,880
places where

368
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,639
you want to have totally opt-in

369
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,560
and there are places where you want to

370
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
have a system that you put in place but

371
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
to make it so that someone can opt out

372
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
the next one is is it transparent

373
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,880
meaning

374
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
do we know what's going on it can we

375
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,120
understand it

376
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
and i don't even mean at

377
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
the low level what are the bits and

378
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,680
bytes doing

379
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,560
there is the what do i expect that it's

380
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,839
going to do

381
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,959
what do i what do i know about the way

382
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
that it's going to work

383
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
um you know if if we think about end to

384
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
end encryption for example

385
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,199
end-to-end encryption is one where the

386
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,320
people who are

387
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
in the encrypted space are the only ones

388
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
who have the keys and nobody else has

389
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,000
them including even the service that is

390
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,519
running it

391
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
and you don't need to know the details

392
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
of key exchange or anything else you

393
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,519
just need to know

394
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
this is the way that it works i mean it

395
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
forms a private space

396
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
and there are all sorts of other places

397
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,399
where the transparency to know

398
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
what it's supposed to do is vital

399
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
because if you don't really

400
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,880
understand what it's going to do you

401
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,279
can't really consent to it and consent

402
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,240
is one of the most important things in

403
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
there

404
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
so beyond that

405
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,880
um is it under control

406
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,480
and this this is kind of like if i am

407
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
doing something

408
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
and i don't like it can i turn it off

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,920
um there are lots of things that sound

410
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
really nice and i would like to try

411
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
and i want to be able to turn them on

412
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,600
and turn them off

413
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,240
uh you know like for example location

414
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,120
things

415
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,000
if i there are cases where in fact i do

416
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,440
want to turn on location

417
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,160
for a website or an app because you know

418
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,720
if i'm

419
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
asking it where's the nearest place to

420
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,480
get

421
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
lunch it's going to be a lot easier if

422
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,000
it can just

423
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
know where i am and

424
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
if i turn that off then that's nice

425
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
there are other sorts of control issues

426
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,039
that are more difficult

427
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,919
because for example a lot of sites want

428
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,240
your address book

429
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,880
and if you give them your address book

430
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,319
and change your mind they're not going

431
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,880
to give you your address book back

432
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,760
and similarly things that want to look

433
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,160
at

434
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
your camera roll

435
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,240
if they look at your pictures and

436
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,400
pull them off to their site for whatever

437
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,360
analysis

438
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
they're not going to give them back so

439
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,720
control

440
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
is a little difficult and it's really

441
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
important

442
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
but it's it's one of the places where we

443
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,559
get into the really nitty-gritty and

444
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,039
there's

445
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,679
there's hard to describe things

446
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,160
sometimes

447
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,039
another one is whom does this serve

448
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
who's it for

449
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
um a lot of the systems that are being

450
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
proposed

451
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
are not for us they're for the

452
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
authorities this is where

453
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
the i need to get into encryption

454
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
because bad things are happening

455
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
they're pushing it towards it being

456
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
a thing that is not necessarily on our

457
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
side

458
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,760
and this is an important way to look at

459
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,320
things

460
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,840
is is is who is doing it for what

461
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
purpose

462
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
also is the interactions that you're

463
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
doing public private

464
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,679
others um i know that we're talking

465
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,360
about end-to-end encryption and those

466
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
are typically private spaces but an

467
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,120
awful lot of what we talk about

468
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,320
are our public or semi-public

469
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,960
and there is a continuum here when i

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,240
think about a bunch of of encrypted

471
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
systems particularly multi-person access

472
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,559
systems

473
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
i fall back on an old aphorism that is a

474
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:57,919
ben

475
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
franklin one which is that three people

476
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
can keep a secret if two of them are

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
dead

478
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
human beings are really bad at keeping

479
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,720
secrets when there's

480
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
a lot of people who know it and and

481
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,760
we know this sort of thing it's like you

482
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
know one of the ways that you do things

483
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
like try to analyze

484
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,919
a conspiracy theory is like how many

485
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,520
people have to keep quiet about it

486
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
that's one of the ways that people

487
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,559
who try to to untangle these

488
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
is that the natural human tendency

489
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
to talk about stuff means that

490
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,120
an encrypted chat with a hundred people

491
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,520
in it

492
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,559
is not private in the way that one that

493
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,120
has

494
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,240
two is and somewhere you know three

495
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,520
people is a lot like

496
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,559
two but a hundred people oh yeah

497
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,000
somebody's gonna blab

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,280
or somebody is in there who's an

499
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,160
informant

500
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,000
or whatever and this is kind of why

501
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
you'll see some things like

502
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
telegram which is got the

503
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,120
best support for large numbers of people

504
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,679
offers

505
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,159
end and encryption for only two people

506
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,840
and it gets used for things like

507
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
protests

508
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,039
because it is the thing that you can do

509
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,400
to manage

510
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
a group of ten thousand twenty thousand

511
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
people

512
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,159
and you just you know that's not going

513
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,080
to be secret it doesn't matter what you

514
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,799
do with it

515
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
so so this is how we look at what's

516
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,039
going on

517
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,039
because a public statement

518
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,159
is going to have different

519
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,080
characteristics in this

520
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,320
human brain to brain thing than a

521
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,080
private statement among two people

522
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,960
i frequently start with this

523
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
and my co-workers who who um

524
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,280
work with me on things will note that i

525
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
have a tendency to jump to

526
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,039
well is this thing actually going to

527
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,720
work

528
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
and i've pushed it down to on my list of

529
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,320
principles

530
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
and design goals number six

531
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,440
but it's still really really really

532
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,559
important

533
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,679
because if it isn't really going to work

534
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,360
if it's going to work badly or if it's

535
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
going to work

536
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,640
only partially it's it's it's a

537
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,840
different system

538
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,440
and um particularly when we

539
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
look at how we want to do things

540
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,280
if it's not going to work why are we

541
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,280
doing it to begin with

542
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
also is this some is something that

543
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
we're going to be doing necessary and

544
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,919
proportionate

545
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,840
if we are going to shape human behavior

546
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
is there a reason for what we're doing

547
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
and are we doing things

548
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
in a a useful

549
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,280
and humane and respectful way

550
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
so this is also one of those things

551
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
you're going to see me work

552
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
on a little bit when we look at stuff

553
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,799
and the last most important thing is

554
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,600
what about mission creep or the slippery

555
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,640
slope

556
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
and there are lots of really good ideas

557
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
that are there but we know that we're

558
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,080
going to start off

559
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,640
using it for this one little exception

560
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,679
case and it's going to be

561
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
the next little exception case and it's

562
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
going to be another one

563
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
and then we're going to be having this

564
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,679
thing being used everywhere

565
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,640
and when it's being used everywhere it's

566
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,080
not appropriate

567
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,760
at all and thus we push back on any use

568
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,039
of it because

569
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,360
it's going to be hard to stop and we see

570
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
this sort of thing go on

571
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
in social systems that we build all the

572
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
time

573
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,400
where we're abstractly

574
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
it's not a bad idea but we know that

575
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,440
this

576
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,840
is not where things are going to stop

577
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,440
and also this isn't a complete list i'm

578
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
sure that you have something or someone

579
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,600
has something

580
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
that i didn't think of and if you tell

581
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,600
me what about blah blah blah i'm going

582
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,799
to say oh yeah that's really good

583
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,159
so there's going to be more ways to look

584
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,520
at stuff but this is

585
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
enough to start with

586
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,559
so i want to look at these things i want

587
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,640
to look at some

588
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
ways to deal with systems that people

589
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
have proposed i'm going to start with

590
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,320
two

591
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,799
obviously bad ones move on to an

592
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,880
obviously okay ones

593
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,360
and then kind of wander more to the

594
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,799
squishy middle

595
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,159
to where we're going to have things

596
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,919
that are not bad ideas but you could do

597
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,840
them well or you could do them

598
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
poorly and if you did them poorly

599
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
they could be something that we would

600
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
all tear our

601
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,520
hair out and say don't do that so

602
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
this is where i want to go to to look at

603
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
the things people have been talking

604
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,720
about

605
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
the first one is my old friend the ghost

606
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
proposal

607
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,159
this was a gchq proposal that came out a

608
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,679
couple of years ago

609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,840
i wrote when i was at the aclu a

610
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,200
long post set of essays on it

611
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,720
that was all about how to break it

612
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,320
and i showed that architecturally

613
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,440
you could just about always

614
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,039
detect that this

615
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
transparent user that people want to

616
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
bring in

617
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,960
could be detected and in a lot of cases

618
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
you could lie to it

619
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,080
so this is idea is you know take

620
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
every chat system and essentially you

621
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
know make it so that

622
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,159
a secret person can enter into the room

623
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,000
at any time

624
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
it's not voluntary it's not

625
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
proportionate there's no control on it

626
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,320
it doesn't serve the user it's not

627
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,679
proportionate to wire

628
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,919
everything in the world so that is so

629
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
that you could have a spy come in

630
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,679
and it's going to have lots of mission

631
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,000
creep

632
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
and as i said i truly believe that it

633
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
wouldn't even be effective

634
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,760
so it fails on nearly everything that we

635
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,000
talk about here

636
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
so-called client-side filtering because

637
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
this has been the proposal where if

638
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
we're going to have end-to-end encrypted

639
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,799
systems and

640
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,000
thus you can't have the spy in the

641
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
middle

642
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,440
what if you put the spies on the edges

643
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
and frequently this means putting

644
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,600
something like photo dna which is a

645
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,720
fuzzy

646
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,159
matcher for images into it

647
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,679
and again i i i copied

648
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,320
the it's not voluntary and proportionate

649
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
etc from the previous slide

650
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
it it fails on on the principles

651
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,919
that we want something to have and

652
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,440
arguably mission creep

653
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,039
is the biggest issue here and aphorism

654
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,520
that i have given on this is that you

655
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,400
start off

656
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,760
wanting to block csam which is

657
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
child sexual abuse material and you end

658
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,880
up blocking

659
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
pictures of winnie the pooh if you

660
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,880
are not familiar with that um the gray

661
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,159
firewall of china

662
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,080
blocks pictures of winnie the pooh and

663
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
the reason is that winnie the pooh has

664
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,000
been used to kind of mock

665
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
chairman xi it started with a meme that

666
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,840
had

667
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
a picture of she and obama walking

668
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,120
together

669
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,320
in approximately the same postures

670
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,960
and position as winnie the pooh and

671
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,799
tigger from the cartoons

672
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,240
and everybody went hahaha on it and

673
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
um their systems

674
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
block winnie the pooh because winnie the

675
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
pooh

676
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
hurts the chairman's feelings

677
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,840
and that's the mission creep problem

678
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
you start off with something that might

679
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,320
make a lot of sense and you end up with

680
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,480
insanity so now we're gonna go

681
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,960
what's obviously okay well you know

682
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
spell check you know

683
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,640
spell check doesn't doesn't ruin

684
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,240
end-to-end encryption the way that

685
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
having a spy in the room has

686
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
and you know similarly grammar checking

687
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
autocorrect or autoduck as i often call

688
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,279
it

689
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,799
um and it's voluntary it's mostly

690
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,120
transparent we know what it does

691
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,679
even though in a lot of these systems

692
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,480
there's some

693
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,600
reasonably complex ai for

694
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,799
what it will do for suggesting words for

695
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,440
you

696
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,720
but you know we know how it works and

697
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
it does really nice things for us and

698
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
among the things that autocorrect

699
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,240
does for us is that you can blame your

700
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
own typos on autocorrect

701
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,279
i've done this i mean you know you've

702
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,320
probably done it too

703
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,520
is that you know it's like oh i didn't

704
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,320
misspeak

705
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,679
darn you autocorrect so

706
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,720
this is a tool that we use in our

707
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,600
in our communication systems to make our

708
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
communications better

709
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,840
it's operating for us it's not doing

710
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
anything untoward

711
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,240
obviously good just like the other ones

712
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,360
were obviously bad

713
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,200
now then like contact discovery

714
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,399
restrictions

715
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,039
this is this is orthogonal to end-to-end

716
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,000
encryption it's not

717
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
about end-to-end encryption at all

718
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,399
ever since we have had a lot of systems

719
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,440
you've been able to use them to

720
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,039
call people that you don't know or

721
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,919
contact people you don't know out of the

722
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
blue

723
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
the postal system lets you send a mail

724
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,960
to any address

725
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,080
you can dial any phone number you can do

726
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,960
other things

727
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
and and we're starting to move

728
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
to controls on things in ways that

729
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
are not intuitive because we've lived

730
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,840
with a century

731
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,240
of open contacts and

732
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
all the mobile operating systems have an

733
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,679
option

734
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,200
for turning off

735
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,159
unsolicited calls and sending them

736
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
straight to voicemail

737
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,240
and the reason for this is that

738
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,559
when you apply computers that make

739
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,600
things be drastically cheaper

740
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,640
robo calls spam emails other things

741
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,760
become

742
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,799
possible and and somewhere between

743
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,840
annoying and abusive in ways that it

744
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,960
wasn't in previous

745
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,799
modes of operation particularly when you

746
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,640
were paying per call or paying per

747
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
minute

748
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,440
and open contact discovery

749
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,640
on today's internet is an invitation to

750
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,760
abuse

751
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,960
one of my friends who is a great

752
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,720
pro encryption blogger and thinker

753
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,000
flat out said you know open contact

754
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,799
discovery

755
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,480
is inviting abuse of women

756
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,279
people of color etc are subjected to

757
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,320
things on the internet piling on happens

758
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,279
to anyone who speaks unthinkingly

759
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,080
and there's a lot of ideas that we could

760
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,320
have for how we would rethink this

761
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,399
because the simplistic one is

762
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,760
things like you know send the phone

763
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
calls voicemail but

764
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
how do we want to manage

765
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,480
who can get into somebody else's dms etc

766
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
and this is one of the opportunities

767
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,039
where somebody should have a good idea

768
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,120
and we're gonna get it right and we're

769
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,240
gonna get it wrong

770
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,039
and we're gonna we're gonna see changes

771
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,480
and it'll be

772
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,559
it'll be different in 10 years than it

773
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,480
is now

774
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,200
so darting back a little bit

775
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,200
it's not really the best pithy term

776
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,399
you know advanced sender editing but

777
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,519
um we've seen this and it could be good

778
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,480
or bad and it's

779
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
coming in a lot of systems like twitter

780
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,440
has just put in a system

781
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,039
where it can advise you on your tweets

782
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,840
whether or not they might offend other

783
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,799
people

784
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
um there was a new feature just last

785
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,399
week

786
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,399
that tinder the dating site

787
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,200
came up with where they were going to be

788
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,399
having

789
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,640
editing systems looking for stuff

790
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,600
because they're

791
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,279
seeing a lot of things where there's

792
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,960
drive-by abuse of people

793
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,919
hurling insults and epithets at people

794
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
which you know also gets back to the

795
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
how do you contact people

796
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
and the place that we need to think

797
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,600
about these

798
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,039
are in fact is it more like spell check

799
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
or is it more like a spy

800
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,640
because i would appreciate

801
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,919
having tools that would tell me stuff

802
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,600
because communication on the internet

803
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,440
can be difficult i mean it's like i was

804
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,279
reading an article the other day

805
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,720
about the connotation of when you

806
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,919
when you end text message with a period

807
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,840
or without one

808
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,360
and and how that conveys an equivalent

809
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,279
of tone of voice

810
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,679
so i can imagine having

811
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,720
a machine learning assistant

812
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,039
that could help me automatically

813
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,919
if i'm someone who is if i know that i'm

814
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,200
a bit brusque

815
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
if i know that i'm prone

816
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,519
to snark that other people

817
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,919
treat as being dismissive that it would

818
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,159
be nice to have an assistant

819
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559
who could help me edit what i do i mean

820
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,200
it's like

821
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,120
i every time i write anything i have

822
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,279
um a friend or someone look over what

823
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,720
i'm doing because

824
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,360
that's the best way to find out you have

825
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,200
stupid mistakes in there and there's

826
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
all sorts of ways that we could have

827
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,440
assistance who could help us

828
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,159
speak better the context for them

829
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,600
is something that that governs how

830
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,519
appropriate something would be i mean

831
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,960
for example

832
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,000
in a dating app i can see a far more

833
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,919
draconian you must use a system

834
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,399
that that's what you're doing because a

835
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,399
dating system is not a general purpose

836
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,840
chat system it's where people are trying

837
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
to go meet each other

838
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
and you know and you want to help them

839
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,559
be on some approximation of their best

840
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
behavior

841
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,040
uh so having having an editing system

842
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,119
is more appropriate than a general

843
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
purpose one

844
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,000
so i really like this but this is one

845
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
of those things where i would love to

846
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,040
see

847
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,119
somebody start working on

848
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,839
ml enhanced sending systems to know

849
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,879
whether or not what i said was good or

850
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,918
not

851
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,079
now the flip side of this is receiver

852
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,199
tools

853
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,199
there are there are

854
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,800
small versions of this that we see

855
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,239
already i mean you know it's like i

856
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,280
quoted from twitter

857
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
more replies some offensive sometimes

858
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,879
you want to see them sometimes you don't

859
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,480
and at least you've been warned

860
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,440
when i first was talking to someone

861
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,160
about well

862
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
couldn't we do this when we were talking

863
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
about this

864
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,640
at a conference over lunch

865
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,119
and the person i was talking to said oh

866
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,400
oh i see

867
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,079
you're saying that we could have the

868
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,920
mansplaining filter

869
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
and i thought yes absolutely why not i

870
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
mean there's all sorts of stuff that

871
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
goes on

872
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,480
you know mansplaining unsolicited dick

873
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,599
pics trolling

874
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,200
insults you name it why not have an

875
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
ml assistant that tells you

876
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,760
maybe you should look at this when

877
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,599
you're in a good mood you're in a hurry

878
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,720
right now

879
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,599
i can tell you're between meetings you

880
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,079
should look at this later

881
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,440
and this is going to be fraud the

882
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
history of spam fighting shows us

883
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,720
that guiding and corralling

884
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,839
potentially unwanted communications is

885
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,680
hard

886
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,000
there are all sorts of ways that people

887
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,400
got it wrong in the early days of spam

888
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,359
fighting and they're

889
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,680
gonna get it wrong the very same way

890
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,720
once they start to build these things

891
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,160
but you know why not i mean i i would

892
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,800
i would love to see an environment where

893
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
different people were

894
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,200
making different sorts of

895
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,839
sender tools and receiver tools that we

896
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,560
could plug

897
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,400
into our systems to help us be

898
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
more pleasant to be around

899
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,240
another big one that's coming is

900
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
advanced blocking and reporting tools

901
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
we've seen that some tests that people

902
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,440
have done is that if you make it easier

903
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,480
to block

904
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,880
if you make it easier to report if you

905
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
make it easier

906
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,800
to to shape how someone talks to you

907
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,720
that this has really good effects on

908
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,839
the civility of the environment there's

909
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,960
also

910
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,839
some really interesting cryptography

911
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,599
that has been used here

912
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,760
for example facebook came out with a

913
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,520
thing called message franking

914
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
which is a way that you can have

915
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,480
a private encrypted conversation and

916
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,200
release

917
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,280
pieces of it when you want to talk to

918
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
about it so you know

919
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,839
alice talks to bob and alice insults bob

920
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,160
and

921
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,520
bob wants to report alice but bob

922
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
also wants to prove to the moderator

923
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,599
that bob didn't just make this

924
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,200
up there i've also seen some papers

925
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,880
coming out of stanford where they're

926
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,800
doing more advanced

927
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,000
cryptographic release of systems

928
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,040
so that moderators

929
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,640
editors and others can effectively

930
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,440
allow people to be private together and

931
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
still

932
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,599
have some sort of incident response

933
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,520
to people being mean to each other and

934
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,640
again you know

935
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
note these are the parallels to what

936
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
we've seen before

937
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,440
you know how you do incident response in

938
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,119
break-ins in in malware

939
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,320
in any sort of vulnerability and exploit

940
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,800
these sorts of things have their analog

941
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,839
when we move from the software to the

942
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,079
people

943
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
there have also been things in

944
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,839
places where like in india where they

945
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,640
have been proposing various laws where

946
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
they want to have

947
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,440
provenance on information that is being

948
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,119
done

949
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,800
personally i think that they're wanting

950
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
a little too much here i mean if you you

951
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,680
know remember email

952
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,440
remember when you forwarded forwarded

953
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
email you got you know you got the

954
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,800
indents on them

955
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,119
you know when when you when you when you

956
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,160
got those horrible

957
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,160
jokes and and the um

958
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
stupid things from your elderly

959
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,520
relatives

960
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,880
that that you could see that oh yes

961
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,560
it it it came from that person didn't it

962
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,960
and so marking provenance on

963
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
messages that go around some sort of

964
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,839
encrypted social network like a large

965
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,560
chat system is actually useful because

966
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
it permits people

967
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,560
to know what's going on it gives people

968
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
the tools to defend

969
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,880
themselves and they could be

970
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,400
cryptographic they could be just

971
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,680
textual

972
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,960
i was a couple of weeks ago in a session

973
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
where we were talking about political

974
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,760
misinformation and someone had this

975
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,480
brilliant

976
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,119
idea and they said what if you could

977
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,720
invite in

978
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,079
a chatbot that would be able to do

979
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,599
things like

980
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,560
debunk

981
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
this information you know what if you

982
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,000
went

983
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
into a chat room and you're talking to

984
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,680
people and you said you know let's

985
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,320
actually

986
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,119
find out what the who says about

987
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,240
vaccines

988
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,480
hey let me bring in the who chatbot

989
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,480
owho chatbot what are

990
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,720
the safety considerations for blah blah

991
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,880
blah blah blah

992
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
thank you you can go now this is a sort

993
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,920
of thing that could that also

994
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,440
could be done right could be done wrong

995
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
but when i heard this i thought what an

996
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
interesting idea

997
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,040
you know because this gets to the idea

998
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
of what we're talking about

999
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,680
which is that we want to be able to

1000
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,839
shape

1001
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,000
communication while maintaining

1002
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
the integrity of a secure space where

1003
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
it is just us talking and

1004
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,680
i'm not really sure how this is going to

1005
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,480
work

1006
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
i mean you know this is this is

1007
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,319
definitely a research project and a

1008
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,079
whole bunch of other stuff but

1009
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,640
i like the idea i want to see if

1010
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,200
somebody

1011
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,040
could make this thing be viable

1012
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,720
there's also lots of other small things

1013
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,800
that people have talked about

1014
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
um user experience

1015
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
friction is one of those things that we

1016
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,000
know

1017
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,160
that if you do things and you make

1018
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,839
something be harder to do

1019
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,040
people do it less often if you're seeing

1020
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,920
a thing

1021
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,200
where in for example whatsapp

1022
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,560
people are forwarding around

1023
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,720
misinformation

1024
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,040
and that is inflaming hatreds

1025
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,040
other horrible things you could make it

1026
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,160
harder to forward

1027
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,280
things we know we know that there's a

1028
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,240
steep drop

1029
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
off i mean that's a lot of what this

1030
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,839
engagement

1031
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,480
style things is doing is that they're

1032
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,200
making it

1033
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,280
easier to share and there are going to

1034
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,480
be places where

1035
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
what we would want to do with is the

1036
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,960
opposite to make it be

1037
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
harder to share because that's better

1038
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,160
for the

1039
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,720
overall way that things are going and

1040
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,000
de-escalates anger and tension

1041
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
group size limits this has been very

1042
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
interesting because

1043
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,520
they're all over the place like i

1044
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
mentioned before

1045
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,119
on telegram you get end-to-end

1046
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,960
encryption on only two people

1047
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,720
i messaged 33 people um

1048
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,000
whatsapp is i think 256 i have

1049
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,760
heard that they're thinking about even

1050
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
bringing it down smaller

1051
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,359
signals a thousand that you know as i

1052
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:37,920
was

1053
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,520
noting um as you get more people

1054
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,160
into a conversation the idea you know

1055
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,240
the fact that it's technically encrypted

1056
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,280
matters less

1057
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,640
you're going to have you know you're

1058
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,040
going to have people who are going to

1059
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,720
talk out of turn i already mentioned

1060
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
forwarding annotations these are things

1061
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,960
that

1062
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,480
we could make small ux changes

1063
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,839
that are designed to give people the

1064
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,440
information that they need

1065
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,240
to make better decisions themselves and

1066
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,680
also to be able to defend

1067
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,400
themselves along with things that we

1068
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,240
mentioned in the past

1069
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
you know it's like a lot of these things

1070
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,520
together could start to make

1071
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,200
us have spaces that are both

1072
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,079
secure end-to-end encrypted private

1073
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,119
spaces

1074
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,000
and yet we have something that is like

1075
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,319
community management going on in them

1076
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,520
so what we're really doing here is that

1077
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,760
we're reconsidering the way that

1078
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,040
we have people interact and

1079
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,119
when i have been thinking about this i

1080
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,880
get reminded of like you know the old

1081
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,440
days

1082
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,920
before when when you know um a pc

1083
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,040
had only one address space

1084
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,640
and apps could stomp on each other

1085
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
and then we gradually got things to be

1086
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,040
more secure and put isolation in place

1087
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,640
and thought about what we were doing

1088
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,960
advanced techniques like you know aslr

1089
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,640
kernel mitigations moving drivers

1090
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,240
out of the kernel isolating dangerous

1091
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,520
bits of code like

1092
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
codecs you know we started doing these

1093
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,960
things and i think they all have

1094
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
analogs to what we do when we're

1095
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
building human systems

1096
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,319
we have built our systems for the last

1097
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,839
few decades

1098
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,920
with the assumption that of course you

1099
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,520
want to talk to anybody who wants to

1100
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,480
talk to you

1101
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,280
when in fact we all know that in fact we

1102
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,640
don't

1103
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,560
so the fact that

1104
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,240
we they're people we don't want to talk

1105
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
to some people are just jerks some

1106
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
people are spammers

1107
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
we all have a bad day when we say

1108
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,280
something that we didn't really mean

1109
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,480
how do we build de-escalation

1110
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,599
systems how do we build things that

1111
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,800
help make it be not

1112
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,480
a health site cage match but make it be

1113
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,880
a place that we look forward to going to

1114
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,839
again

1115
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,280
and those of us who have infosec

1116
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,280
skills can work with the people who do

1117
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,480
ux people who do community management

1118
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,079
people who understand psychology

1119
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,160
persuasion and other things so that we

1120
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,119
design our

1121
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,160
systems in a different way so that

1122
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,040
they become just nicer places to be

1123
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,880
now tying a lot of this up together

1124
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,440
again secure communication is a basic

1125
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,280
human right

1126
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,400
human beings need to be able to talk

1127
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,240
in private with other human beings we

1128
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,599
we do not deal well with isolation

1129
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,680
it's like it's like you know as as if

1130
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,280
after 15 months

1131
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,839
of a pandemic i have to tell you that

1132
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
humans don't do well with isolation

1133
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,000
um and while end-to-end encryption means

1134
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,880
there are no spies it does not mean that

1135
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,760
we can't

1136
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,319
encourage things that have in it some

1137
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,800
sort of communication self-defense

1138
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,200
so that we can take care of ourselves

1139
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,880
better

1140
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
and of course there's going to be all

1141
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,440
sorts of opportunities for people to do

1142
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,240
utterly brilliant things and the

1143
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,000
inevitable

1144
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,640
large number of face palming mistakes

1145
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,240
that we're all going to giggle over

1146
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,960
because

1147
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,440
we saw those before in other places too

1148
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,800
this is no different

1149
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,760
it's we have to learn how to build

1150
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,520
systems

1151
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,880
differently than we were building them

1152
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,319
before and that means that we're going

1153
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,040
to

1154
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,960
experiment we're going to

1155
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,960
do some great stuff and do some really

1156
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,760
horrible stuff

1157
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,520
so that's what i wanted to talk about

1158
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,079
and i know this is a different talk than

1159
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,760
what a lot of ones are because really

1160
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,680
what i want to do is i want to say that

1161
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,680
that for those of us who come to places

1162
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,359
like this there are these new

1163
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,599
opportunities in place

1164
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,839
that i was fortunate enough

1165
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,760
to be in the right place at the right

1166
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,800
time

1167
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,839
to be on sort of the ground floor of

1168
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,599
encryption going everywhere

1169
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,720
and large amounts of it were just plain

1170
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,920
luck

1171
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,680
and taking advantage of an opportunity

1172
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,040
and so i want to say i see

1173
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,319
this great opportunity where where

1174
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,000
the sorts of skills that we have

1175
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,720
help the skills that other people have

1176
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,040
and

1177
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,040
that we can learn these new things

1178
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
because you know it's like i i was a ux

1179
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,200
person who learned about crypto

1180
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,240
um you could be a you can be a security

1181
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,400
person who learns about user experience

1182
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,079
and community things too

1183
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,119
it it's it's a lot of fun when you can

1184
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:09,520
build

1185
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,960
things that make a difference so

1186
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,800
that's my talk and if there are

1187
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,520
questions brick bats you want to throw

1188
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,280
at me cries of anguish

1189
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,200
we got like about almost 10 minutes

1190
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,319
to talk uh

1191
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,760
however for the questions

1192
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,800
etc we are going to divert those to

1193
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,559
the studio so immediately after this

1194
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,800
john has already agreed he has been very

1195
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
generous with his time he will be

1196
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,079
joining us in the hitb

1197
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,040
studio with dylan and streaming to

1198
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
answer any questions

1199
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,160
