00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,760
hi everyone my name is zukapram and i'm

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,119
the co-founder and ceo

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
of secops today i'll be giving the talk

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
on the state of mobile security

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
at hacking the box in 2021

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
in amsterdam this is the keynote uh

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,160
presentation

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,079
i'm very excited to do that i uh i've

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
always had a great pleasure um

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,520
attending hacking the box and speaking

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
attack in the box

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
um so this is a very special event for

13
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,399
me i spoke

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
the first time in hacking the box i

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
think it was 2011

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
and i loved the event

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
ever since the team was just

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,960
spectacular and i

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,399
really i really love the attention to

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
details the great quality of

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
presentations

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
um and the entire hacking the box team

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
and dylan himself

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
uh are just amazing so really happy to

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
to be giving this talk

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,680
and let me share the screen and we'll

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
get started

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
so

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,840
today we'll be speaking about the state

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,759
of mobile security my background before

31
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,040
we get started

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
i live in san francisco originally from

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
israel moved here about six years ago

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
and i wish i could do this talk in

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,600
person

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
but i guess only next year i will be

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,360
able to do that

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
and i've been doing mobile

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
well security research my entire life

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
and i've been focusing

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,640
on mobile security ever since i joined

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,600
samsung

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,560
in back in 2010 and um

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
at the time i was working on hacking

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
smart devices

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
smart tvs uh smartphones uh and

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,200
i've been given the opportunity of

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
proving that um

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,560
arm devices at the time with new uh

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
mitigations was still hackable but they

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,160
also gave me the

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
opportunity of writing full exploits and

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
even publishing

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
some of this research at

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,239
conferences like defcon and blackhead

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,160
afterwards i founded zimperio

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
and in 2017 i founded i co-founded the

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
zack hopps

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,599
i like everything related to cyber

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,200
security and mobile dfir in particular

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,640
i also am enjoying chess

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
and cookings and so this is my email and

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,720
my

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
my twitter some of you know me as i

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,560
hackbandme

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,599
on twitter alright so let's

67
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
let's get started this is a very

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
important topic it's a

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,879
topic that is um i've been

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,319
giving a lot of energies uh for

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
and uh i watched it very closely

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,560
over the years and so hopefully

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
i can share some of my experience and

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
what i'm seeing um

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
as well as maybe some

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
heads up on what's coming into endpoints

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,319
and servers

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,280
and if we don't react now as a community

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
together

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
uh it's all known on how smartphones are

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,640
important for us but just to put things

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
in perspective

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
the 3 billion users out there using

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
mobile devices about 3 billion these

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
devices have microphones they have

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,040
cameras they have

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
access to all emails all sms's

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,280
and our most sensitive data videos

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,159
pictures

90
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
contacts and whatnot they're always on

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,519
us they're always connected

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,519
they expose a quite a big attack surface

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,640
from remote um and

94
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,120
um i mean just look everywhere people

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,159
are always on their phones

96
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,200
and i think very important to mention

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
that it's being used as our second

98
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
factor

99
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,000
so as an attacker

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,479
if an attacker attacks your pc they

101
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
still need to hack your phone or find a

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
way to

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
receive this second fact of

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
authentication but if they hacked

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,199
your phone they don't need to hack

106
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,960
anything else so this is really becoming

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
the most

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,040
important target to protect but it

109
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
it is also the biggest target

110
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
with the least amount of visibility that

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
we have

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
but always it came back to that oh but i

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
have old garden and

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
and i'm protected i'm not downloading

115
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,759
from third party app store so i'm

116
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,320
protected

117
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,120
that's actually not the real the the

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
real threat if you're dealing with

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
actors like

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,960
um nso and other commercial groups as

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
well as nation states

122
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
it but really it became more intense for

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,680
me

124
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,919
in 2017 summer of 2017 so i just

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
walked around in new york and i noticed

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,360
that my phone

127
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
suddenly rebooted and

128
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
as a security researcher i know that

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
this could happen for multiple reasons

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,120
one of them could be a kernel panic it

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
could also happen

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
and when you click accidentally on the

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
power button it could also happen

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,199
when the device is overheated and

135
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,800
but i wasn't clicking on the power

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
button i wasn't the

137
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
device wasn't too hot

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,199
in any significant way and

139
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
i realized that i just experienced the

140
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
kernel panic on my phone

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
now channel panic on the phone doesn't

142
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
necessarily have to be because of

143
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
security reasons

144
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,039
but in this particular case once i

145
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,560
looked at the logs

146
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
i noticed that it happened because of a

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
security mitigation that was triggered

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
uh 99.9 percent of the people would

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
never actually check the kernel logs

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
whenever something like that happens uh

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
but this is where i really

152
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
took a deeper dive into the rabbit hole

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,880
of

154
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
what smartphone's security really means

155
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,000
and how

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
big the gap is uh that we have to close

157
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,360
asap for for this entire planet i mean

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,759
three billion is a very

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
big amount of device owners

160
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
compared to the entire population of

161
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
planet health

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
so we really have to do something about

163
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
it and

164
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
so i took a deeper dive into this kennel

165
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
panic it was a security mitigation that

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,639
was triggered

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,880
and and it basically panicked when

168
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,000
the kernel expected a certain value in

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,280
what ios kernel calls non-poison cookie

170
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,919
but uh it actually seen a different

171
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,560
value

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,000
it was one bit different than the

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
expected value and the current value at

174
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,319
the time

175
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
and as a result of that the kernel

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,919
protected itself and rebooted

177
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,199
and interestingly enough this mitigation

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
only runs once every 32 allocations

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,599
so as an attacker your exploit would

180
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
walk 31 out of 32 times

181
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,880
and that's an acceptable risk

182
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,319
but this is only one bit that flipped so

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,840
i mean it could happen for other reasons

184
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
it could happen because of memory

185
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,160
corruption

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
uh it's possible um it could also happen

187
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,400
because of a code because of uh

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,280
cosmic rays uh one researcher suggested

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
that

190
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,479
you can actually calculate that it's

191
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
it's very low probability but

192
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,360
it's it's possible and

193
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
knowing what i do and knowing you know

194
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
the things

195
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,360
i've been involved in and all the

196
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
stories about researchers getting

197
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,400
targeted

198
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
it wasn't such

199
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,720
an ex it wasn't unexpected to see that

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
and so i did take a deeper dive and it

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,599
definitely

202
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,360
uh looked suspicious but i couldn't

203
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
conclude what's going on

204
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,479
part of that was because um i was

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,599
blocked for my

206
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
analyzing my own device but really two

207
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,680
weeks later

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
what happened was that my phone panicked

209
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,319
again this time i was at defcon

210
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
2017. the taxi driver took a different

211
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,240
route

212
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
and as soon as i exited airplane mode

213
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,599
because during the conference

214
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
i was in airplane mode and

215
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,919
the the phone panicked i immediately

216
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
looked at the kernel logs and i noticed

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
and my eyes went dark basically i

218
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
noticed that

219
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
the baseband binary

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
in this particular case com center

221
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,439
mobile helper

222
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,920
was running an unsigned version of it so

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,880
this is why the

224
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,959
the kernel panicked it ran a cs ops

225
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
operation and it failed on this

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
particular process

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
so at that point i was really curious

228
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
what's going on

229
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,600
is my phone compromised and because the

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,480
kernel gave me

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
this path to this file this com center

232
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
mobile helper

233
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
that was replaced and and wasn't um the

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
expected signed

235
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,120
executable that and the kernel wanted to

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
see

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
um i wanted to extract that file

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,279
it's very simple so when i

239
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,519
tried to do it in traditional ways

240
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
i couldn't do it when i asked the vendor

241
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
to provide me file system dump they

242
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
didn't want to commit not on the time

243
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
not on what i'll get and

244
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
not on anything they did however offered

245
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
me a free device but i wasn't interested

246
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
in a free device i was interested in the

247
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,720
attack i was interested in the details i

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
was interested in

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,880
what's happening on my own phone and who

250
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,240
attacked me

251
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
and i wanted them to pay for doing that

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
so i uh i needed a local privilege

253
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
escalation exploit

254
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,279
and google project zero happened to have

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
to they have announced uh or i i was

256
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,320
told that they are about to release

257
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
uh this local proof escalation exploit

258
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
for that particular version of ios

259
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,600
and so i asked i basically begged

260
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
ben hawkes from google project zero to

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
provide me access to that file because

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
i'm running out of time i know that the

263
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
doctors are using time bombs which we'll

264
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,480
discuss later

265
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
and if i'm not going to do it fast

266
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,680
enough

267
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
i'm going to lose my opportunity to

268
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
discover this attack

269
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
a few weeks later google project zero

270
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,560
did actually

271
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
uh release it ben hawkes didn't want to

272
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,200
share with me

273
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
the the lp while um

274
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,120
at that point in time i understand i

275
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,839
mean people

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,279
don't always want to show their their

277
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,120
local proof escalations but i was

278
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
basically blocked from

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
analyzing my own device i was blocked

280
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
from analyzing the specific file the

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,040
kernel

282
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
told me that was tampered with and that

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,640
was temple

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760
so i uh i was

285
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
blocked and this is where i really took

286
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
a deeper dive into

287
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
what's really happening in mobile

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,079
security because if i was attacked

289
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
how many other people are attacked i

290
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
mean i'm not that important i'm not

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
important

292
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
the people way more important than me

293
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,320
with

294
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
with access to to many things i'm

295
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
actually not using my phone to access

296
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
anything important

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
so why was i

298
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,880
targeted uh and how many other people

299
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,240
are targeted how many people

300
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
viewing this presentation are actively

301
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
targeted

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
and so that's what i want to check

303
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
the answer actually scared me more than

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
i anticipated i didn't know how common

305
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
it is now i do know it's very common

306
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,680
and it's not as common as like 50

307
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
of the population but if you're doing

308
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
something of importance

309
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,600
um you're definitely targeted one way or

310
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
the other by one protector or the other

311
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,880
so what's what's the problem the problem

312
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,200
with mobile security is that phones are

313
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
very limited in what you can see so if

314
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
you think about it

315
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,760
and it was originally or at least

316
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,800
marketed as

317
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,519
privacy solutions so uber for example

318
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,279
cannot see if lift is installed on your

319
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
device and then offer you more

320
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,000
competitive rates

321
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,040
which by the way i mean that will be not

322
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,440
bad

323
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
if we get more competitive rates um if

324
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,839
they know it was installed on the device

325
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,680
but let's put that aside and let's

326
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
assume that's actually a good thing

327
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,959
so if

328
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,279
uber cannot see lyft can our

329
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,560
anti-viruses see

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
malware or other applications that that

331
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
exist on the device the answer is not

332
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
but as a result of privacy

333
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,440
we cannot make sure that our phone is

334
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,360
private and that's really a problem

335
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
we'll talk about that later

336
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,079
and also one of the other issues is in

337
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,160
our computers you know macs

338
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,959
you know servals in linux we have

339
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,800
local admins root user

340
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
why don't we have the same on our mobile

341
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
why don't we have the same type of

342
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
access

343
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,360
on our smartphone so this is really um

344
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,959
uh something i want to change

345
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,839
this is something that we deserve as as

346
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
two to three billion people that have

347
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
smartphones we have to change that

348
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
because of what these devices include

349
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
microphone camera

350
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,040
and and our second factor of

351
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
authentication

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
and for some people even large amount of

353
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
cryptocurrencies

354
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
we should have the ability of inspecting

355
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
these devices

356
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
but really when i i wanted to check for

357
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
myself like how bad is it like

358
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,920
how how common it is to see

359
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,199
acknowledgments from vendors that are

360
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,240
under attack i mean

361
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
obviously they prefer not to acknowledge

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
at all and we'll see that

363
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
uh shortly but when they actually

364
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
acknowledge that there will attacks and

365
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,079
there are a few things that are very

366
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,320
similar for example they say

367
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,399
this may be under limited and targeted

368
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,600
exploitation

369
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,680
what do you mean targeted and limited

370
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,839
was it five people was it five thousand

371
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,600
was it fifty thousand was it five

372
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
hundred thousand or five million users

373
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
i mean with one billion devices out

374
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
there you can say five million is very

375
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
targeted

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,720
and very limited exploitation these four

377
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
vulnerabilities

378
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,240
specifically fixed in in the may update

379
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
in android they allow attacker to gain

380
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,120
full access

381
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
to the device and the attackers actually

382
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,399
get

383
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,639
higher privileges than what you get as a

384
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,519
device owner

385
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
and we have to level that up we have to

386
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,519
make sure that we get the same access as

387
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,839
the attackers

388
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,000
we are fighting in happy battle and we

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
have to

390
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,800
uh correct that now before i continue

391
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
you may think to yourself hey this guy

392
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
is doing most mobile stuff

393
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
he wants higher privileges for his own

394
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,560
good

395
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
but you actually couldn't be more wrong

396
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,320
about it

397
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
i'm not doing it for myself

398
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
i probably have better access than

399
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
the majority of the people doing mobile

400
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
security research

401
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,079
have access to lps i have access to

402
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,839
to things that are not available

403
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,759
to most of the people out there

404
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,720
the problem and if we actually

405
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,120
share this if we actually receive this

406
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,560
access i will be

407
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
equal i'll be on power with everyone

408
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
else it will give them

409
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,440
uh to be to be on the same level as

410
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
as my access so in a way i'll i'll not

411
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,120
have

412
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
this huge advantage anymore um

413
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,440
but i'm not looking at it like that i'm

414
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,040
not looking at it as

415
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,040
okay i'll be um with the same level of

416
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
access as

417
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
company x or y i'm looking at as

418
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,079
this is what's important for the

419
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,839
industry this is what's important for

420
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,720
every sock

421
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
in the world this is what's important

422
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,360
for every politician

423
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
that wants to keep their democracy

424
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
this is what's important for every prime

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
minister or every

426
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
vip or journalist or researcher

427
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,360
that wants to make sure that their phone

428
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,199
is not compromised and if they are

429
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,720
compromised to make sure that the

430
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
attackers pay for

431
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
for making these mistakes attacking them

432
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,480
so extracting these payloads

433
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
even for the attackers if you are

434
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
working for a government and you work

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,400
for

436
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,439
or work for a commercial group

437
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,799
this access is actually good for you uh

438
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,919
because same attacker like like you are

439
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,359
attacking others

440
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,119
people attack you so your phone is

441
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,520
compromised probably too

442
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,439
and not being able to analyze it

443
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,760
properly that's

444
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,119
that's a really big problem

445
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,600
so this is how i look at things i want

446
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
to make sure that everyone

447
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
gets equal access the same level of

448
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
access that the attacker gets we have to

449
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,000
level it up and there are also other

450
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
problems that

451
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
lps do not solve they actually cause

452
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,200
some issues

453
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,720
especially when dealing with them

454
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,520
at scale deployments and when dealing

455
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,559
with

456
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,600
um non-persistent attacks

457
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
so we'll cover also this too and this is

458
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,600
why i actually don't use

459
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,320
i don't recommend using lps for

460
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
investigations

461
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
and prefer to convince the vendors to do

462
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,919
otherwise to do the good

463
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,240
good decision and actually open up a

464
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
local admin rights for users

465
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
let's continue so this is from january

466
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,480
2021

467
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
again another vulnerability it may be

468
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,679
under limited

469
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,360
targeted exploitation okay great uh only

470
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
four months about

471
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,080
um and then i just saw yesterday uh then

472
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,280
from house technica actually wrote that

473
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960
it's a bit of uh odd to write this

474
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
this cash like this this

475
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,440
meaningless uh this

476
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
sentence in each one of the uh

477
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
vulnerabilities that were exploited in

478
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
the wild i mean

479
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,640
you want to give us details give us

480
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,120
details give us the iocs give us the

481
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,440
uh the cnc servers give us the path that

482
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,480
the malware used

483
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
give us more information about the

484
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,400
exploits more information about the

485
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,120
vulnerabilities

486
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
you give us the number how many were

487
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,760
targeted

488
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,679
and i honestly

489
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,520
don't necessarily believe these numbers

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,799
or anymore

491
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
i don't believe the limited and targeted

492
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
exploitation just like i didn't believe

493
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,679
google

494
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,360
when they said that um stage fight was

495
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
not exploited

496
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
actually knew that it was exploited

497
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,080
and in the wild i mean even in our demos

498
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,720
once we

499
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
we demonstrated it uh i mean we attacked

500
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,160
many devices for for demonstration

501
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,080
purposes how can they

502
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
say it wasn't exploited in the wild like

503
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
how would they know if our demo

504
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
was a real attack or not i mean we got a

505
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,840
shell

506
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,880
on the the target device and we've

507
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
demonstrated that

508
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,400
it was infected as a result of stage

509
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,120
fright

510
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
so how can they say that that it wasn't

511
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
exploited and also on top of that

512
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
i mean some that commercial threat

513
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,200
actors

514
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,159
told me that as a result of statewide

515
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,960
being patched

516
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,360
they actually lost um some

517
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,320
vulnerabilities that

518
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,799
they were using so i know for a fact

519
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
that it was expected in the wild

520
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,720
and i also know as a result of this

521
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,039
that google and we can also infer that

522
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,400
apple

523
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,679
do not have real real statistics on

524
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,640
attacks

525
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,559
whenever the attackers are preventing

526
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,840
them from seeing

527
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,320
those statistics so this is one of the

528
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,039
biggest problems in the mobile world

529
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
when you have a single burial

530
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,960
of of defense once the attackers bypass

531
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
that

532
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,520
they just make sure that the vendor

533
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,640
cannot see that anymore and

534
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
as a result of that they're completely

535
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
invisible to the vendor

536
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,039
and by the way while many of my examples

537
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
will speak about ios or android i'm not

538
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,039
referring to any specific vendor

539
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,919
i think this is a problem in apple this

540
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,360
is a problem in google in

541
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,960
samsung in lg in anyone else

542
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
this is a problem in the entire industry

543
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,679
and we have to change that

544
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,000
the level of access that we have let's

545
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,360
take a look at ios

546
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,640
so here there is a google tag

547
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
discovery and

548
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,960
they have basically found an attack that

549
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,720
was exploited in the wild he doesn't

550
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,159
mention that it was exploited in the

551
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,080
wild but it was

552
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,880
and that's a bit of unfortunate but

553
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
let's see how it goes in other

554
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,000
disclosures so this was

555
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
uh 12.1.4 now we're skipping to a future

556
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,200
version's most

557
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
recent versions 14.2 they say

558
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
this exploit for this issue exists in

559
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
the wild

560
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,039
somebody was exploiting kernel

561
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,120
vulnerabilities on ios devices

562
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
but we don't have iocs we don't have the

563
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
urls we don't have the paths

564
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
we don't have any report we don't know

565
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,600
how many people were attacked

566
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,720
using these vulnerabilities uh where is

567
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
the transparency

568
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,000
like we also know that

569
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
apple didn't really notify xcode ghost

570
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,720
infected devices about it they just put

571
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,039
it

572
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
in a faq page that nobody reads so

573
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,720
were those people notified about these

574
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,120
attacks

575
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
share with us something else share with

576
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
us more information

577
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,679
um now

578
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
i was 14.4 and

579
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
same thing it says that apple is aware

580
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,799
that this may

581
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,280
issue may have been actively exploited

582
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,679
it may have been actively exploited like

583
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,200
oh i don't know it's very very vague

584
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,120
anonymous researcher is that like a

585
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
government is that something else

586
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,159
um but a kernel bug and webkit bug i

587
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:54,480
mean

588
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
it's always a rest recipe for travel

589
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,159
so it allows remote code execution to to

590
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,120
attack us

591
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
but here again no report no ioc is

592
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
nothing not even

593
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,080
how many devices were attacked

594
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
um i was 14.5 so we continue again this

595
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,799
issue is exploited in the wild a pretty

596
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,080
pretty uh uh good amount of discoveries

597
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
recently that that have that but here

598
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,600
again no report no iocs

599
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,679
and also 14.5.1 another version that was

600
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,600
uh fixed and and

601
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
let's take let's take an example let's

602
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
let's think okay

603
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
from the pc world and what

604
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,600
would have been different um if in the

605
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,159
last

606
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,640
20 years we didn't have local admin so

607
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,679
for example

608
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
one once i looked into that i kind of

609
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,520
remember the

610
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,600
solarwinds attack used stage two

611
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,960
of this attack they planted the dll into

612
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
the c windows directory the windeal

613
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,158
directory

614
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,320
in an alternative universe

615
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,120
an alternative dimension sorry i don't

616
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,840
have dimension

617
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
if we didn't have local admin on windows

618
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,600
we wouldn't be able to discover

619
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
solarwinds

620
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,159
attack that's how bad it is

621
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
but we are not in an alternative

622
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,919
dimension yet

623
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
and we uh we still have local admin on

624
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
windows

625
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
also do microsoft do plan to change that

626
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,600
so

627
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,120
just like on mobile when uh the mobile

628
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
vendors basically say hey we have

629
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,039
like we are doing the job for you you

630
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
don't need to worry about security

631
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,720
which is obviously not true imagine

632
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
microsoft saying that too

633
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,679
so this is why it's really important for

634
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,320
us

635
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,279
to to change that because i mean i i

636
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
don't think anyone

637
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,840
can fight malware alone and

638
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,240
by having deeper access to these devices

639
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
we are able to find more things together

640
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
this is how the solarwinds

641
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
attack was found but many many other

642
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
malware over the history of windows were

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
discovered

644
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,559
um in in a similar way

645
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
so this is quite important and if we

646
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
take that away from us

647
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
i mean why do we need to even have socks

648
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,640
in in

649
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
the entire world there's no need i mean

650
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,679
microsoft will do well do all the work

651
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:28,000
right

652
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,120
obviously obviously not so but

653
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,360
just to to get a better understanding

654
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,320
but let's

655
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,360
go back to on uh they mention

656
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
and think about mobile attacks in

657
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,039
particular so this is from the

658
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,039
2019 implant implant teardown

659
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
by google project zero and what is said

660
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,600
here is that there is no way for a user

661
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
in ios to view the process listing so

662
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,600
the implant binary makes no attempt

663
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,400
to hide its execution from the system so

664
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,520
it's actually

665
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
the malware autos are

666
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,240
protected by the sandbox and as a result

667
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
of that

668
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
the users cannot see them it's that bad

669
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
the one will simply run the file from

670
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
slash temp so this is the file it's very

671
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,559
easy

672
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
uh for them it's very convenient nobody

673
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
actually looks at that even if

674
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,200
if apple checks that and they will see

675
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
that

676
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,559
this file i mean there are many files

677
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,200
like that

678
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
uh this structure

679
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,559
it would get lost in the noise and they

680
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
would never know about it

681
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
but really the important thing is this

682
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
folder is blocked due to sandbox

683
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,960
restrictions and you're not

684
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,120
able to access this file

685
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,039
at all without running a local project

686
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,320
escalation

687
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,360
google was just lucky because they had

688
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,679
access to the exploit itself

689
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,960
so they had access to the uh to the

690
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
infection and from from the web they

691
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,279
found this malware because this payload

692
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,960
was so

693
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
bad in terms of opsec that they

694
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,159
communicated every minute they did

695
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,559
unencrypted so it's a very bad upset but

696
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
very amazing exploits and simply because

697
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
the attackers didn't care about what's

698
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,240
happening

699
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
post exploitation and this really shows

700
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,880
out how bad

701
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,080
it is let's take a look at the uh

702
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,039
uh attack on a journalist of al jazeera

703
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,000
um

704
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,600
and this journalist was attacked by nsos

705
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,399
malware and here the iocs are private

706
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:32,880
about

707
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,080
db and private file temp you cannot

708
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,039
access both of them

709
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
so if your phone was communicating with

710
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,520
nso servers you cannot actually take

711
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
these files and

712
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
extract them this actually happened

713
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,360
as well i mentioned to the vendor hey

714
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
this phone is communicating with nso

715
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,399
servers

716
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,760
their response was believe it or not

717
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
they said we have no evidence so we do

718
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,679
not

719
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,760
this is not sufficient information for

720
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,720
us

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
to know that this phone is compromised

722
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,039
what do you mean like what i'm asking

723
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,360
you

724
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,120
is to allow me to extract the file

725
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
system so i can provide you

726
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,440
also the the implants that they were

727
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,559
using

728
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
how can you say that based on the device

729
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
communicating with

730
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,880
cnc server that there's no enough

731
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,840
evidence that this phone is compromised

732
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,760
so what you're not going to help me to

733
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,879
extract the file system

734
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,200
okay so you're actually not interested

735
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,799
in discovering the attack that's what

736
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,520
you're saying

737
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
okay i got that i got that and this is

738
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,760
what we're trying to change

739
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,880
because this is not the best way

740
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,720
not for the vendors and not for us and

741
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
smartphone users regardless of who this

742
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,919
vendor is

743
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,360
it's it's really applicable to all of

744
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
them

745
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,039
so just some fruitful thoughts so a lot

746
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,120
of missing and confusing mentioning no

747
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
reports no iocs

748
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
us security updates for unsupported

749
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
devices is actually a great way to know

750
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,240
if a vulnerability is actively exploited

751
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,559
also on other devices so you can see

752
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,159
you can see that so if you look at for

753
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,240
example 12.5.3

754
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
which is only there available for

755
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,919
unsupported devices you see that they

756
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,679
only fixed security issues and also in

757
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,039
the previous versions

758
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
so this is actually a really good way of

759
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,880
knowing what

760
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,919
the risk is so if if you want to even

761
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,720
practice

762
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,080
some exploitation uh techniques you can

763
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,559
look at

764
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,720
all the devices that were exploited and

765
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,480
you can

766
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
realize from that which ones are are

767
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,000
probably

768
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,080
the better vulnerabilities to take a

769
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
look at

770
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,799
all these examples exist why are we

771
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,640
still blocked from extracting payloads

772
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
analyzing the memory i mean

773
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720
what's what are you going to say that

774
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,120
now

775
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
moving forward there are no not going to

776
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
be any more attacks in the wild

777
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,240
it's not so believable is it

778
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
um and of course we are the iocs now

779
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
let's talk about lps okay so we do have

780
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,760
lps

781
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,679
we don't care about anything else that's

782
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,760
actually not true so

783
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,880
when you're running lpes in order to do

784
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,279
extractions in order to do analysis of

785
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,240
devices

786
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
there are a lot of disadvantages for

787
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,760
example um

788
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,320
you can you cannot basically share it

789
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,360
with anyone

790
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,039
um you know to to use it right like

791
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,559
you're basically sharing a vulnerability

792
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,880
that's that's obviously not good

793
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
um also it's only local public

794
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,320
escalation i

795
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,159
and i personally don't consider it as

796
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,440
too dangerous

797
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,880
uh i mean

798
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
you don't want to share this lp

799
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,480
chain with with people you don't know

800
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,039
and trust

801
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,200
and you want to disclose this because

802
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
you want to do the right thing you want

803
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
to make sure that these vulnerabilities

804
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
are not being used against you against

805
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,279
others

806
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,399
but you have to keep it because you have

807
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
to keep a potential weakness

808
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,200
and you know to be able to analyze

809
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,559
devices

810
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,120
so every time i actually reported an nlp

811
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,360
i regretted that in the future

812
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,320
and so do i actually advise

813
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,158
um not to share lpes with device vendors

814
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,159
i think until this this changes the only

815
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,120
way to analyze

816
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,880
devices in a deep way in the full way

817
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
is keeping those lpes and that's

818
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
unfortunate because i actually believe

819
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
that the platform should fix those

820
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,240
vulnerabilities

821
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,440
but we are being forced

822
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,919
not to share them with the vendors not

823
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,720
to fix them

824
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,799
to keep these weaknesses open

825
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
and that's wrong that's not how it

826
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
should be

827
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
done i mean not to whitehead at least

828
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,960
whitehead people i mean if you're

829
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,799
working a commercial third actor

830
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,399
you obviously don't care if you're

831
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,000
working for a government

832
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,279
probably use it for yourself but

833
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
this is actually not not the best way to

834
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
do it

835
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,919
it's also unstable so

836
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
let's say this exploit works seven times

837
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,559
out of ten or eight times out of ten

838
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,559
what happens in this other two or three

839
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,760
times out of ten

840
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,480
so basically the device reboots so if

841
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,919
you are checking a phone

842
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,159
that is compromised by a non-persistent

843
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,960
actor

844
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,279
and you cause the reboot you destroy the

845
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,200
investigation you ruined the entire

846
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,679
investigation

847
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
and the problem is you ruined it while

848
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
you did everything right

849
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,159
because this is what is expected from

850
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,080
you you will

851
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,159
they expect you to run local private

852
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,360
escalations you know to

853
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,519
to analyze those devices they also

854
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,200
expect you that after you do that

855
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
that you'll report them both the

856
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,919
vulnerabilities you found and the

857
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,279
vulnerabilities you used

858
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,799
in order to do this investigation

859
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,840
that's just odd and then porting

860
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,519
vulnerability so there's a new

861
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,279
ios update or there's a new android

862
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,919
update you need to port these lpes

863
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
into this new version and the time that

864
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,720
it takes you to for this vulnerability

865
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
could be enough time for the threat

866
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
actor to realize hey this device is not

867
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,960
communicating

868
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,399
communicating for two weeks or two

869
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,640
months we should they

870
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
trigger the self-destruct option which

871
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,919
we'll talk about

872
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,919
shortly and also the vulnerability can

873
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,440
be patched so

874
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,279
our new mitigation can be released so it

875
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,679
can prevent access for

876
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,960
multiple uh weeks or months

877
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,679
even so you're basically being blocked

878
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
from analyzing

879
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,360
devices i mean the entire file system

880
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
etc

881
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
and when you're speaking about you know

882
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
vendors that can

883
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,159
sell those lps and um

884
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,600
extraction tools the reality is very

885
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
different than what is being advertised

886
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
so first of all these vendors do not

887
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
necessarily have lps for everything like

888
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,719
they

889
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,440
some of them claim they do um and

890
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,119
oftentimes whatever you have public is

891
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,879
actually the same thing that they have

892
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,879
the second thing is whenever they do

893
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,800
have something unique

894
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,639
and i only can think of one vendo

895
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,719
that has it they don't necessarily want

896
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,000
to sell it to you

897
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,879
they only want to sell it to high paying

898
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,399
government clients and they want to do

899
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,000
it for different purposes

900
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,199
they don't necessarily do it for cyber

901
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,119
security purposes they're doing

902
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,320
it for the ability of

903
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
bypassing the pin code or or

904
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,800
bypassing device restrictions and

905
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,520
so these are some of the the reasons and

906
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,079
then

907
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,918
if you're waiting for fixing the

908
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,599
vulnerabilities or if

909
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
porting it etc and takes too long then

910
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
you can you're basically losing the race

911
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,760
and the time bomb can be activated

912
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,400
um and as a result of that you will not

913
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,550
be able to

914
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,720
[Music]

915
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,520
find the malware that was on the device

916
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,160
once you

917
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,960
started the investigation and also

918
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
another problem is you cannot use this

919
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,359
at scale

920
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,599
you cannot just take 10 000 devices and

921
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,520
run local group escalations

922
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,160
on them or hundred thousand it just it

923
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,480
doesn't work it causes reboots it causes

924
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,320
problems you can get banned from the app

925
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,760
store or the play store

926
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,040
um i mean it's it's not worth it so

927
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
on one hand they do not allow you to use

928
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
it on the other hand you have no other

929
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,720
choice

930
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,680
so it's really catch 22 here um and it's

931
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
terrible

932
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
it's also unreasonable to request every

933
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,200
sock in the world to hold

934
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,760
lps zero days it's just impossible

935
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,960
why do we have deeper access on every

936
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
other platform but we don't have it on

937
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,320
on smartphones so

938
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,640
just going back into the time bomb this

939
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,880
is a document from the leak of

940
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,720
the pegasus nso product guidelines um

941
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,160
and this leak revealed some of the

942
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,720
things but

943
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,760
i want to to mention that they have a

944
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,480
self-destruct mechanism so if your phone

945
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,119
was compromised and you want to analyze

946
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:17,920
it

947
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
the traditional forensics method would

948
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,960
be

949
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,200
you need to unplug the computer from the

950
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,440
the network socket you need to

951
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,640
turn it off you need to do um you know

952
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,480
investigation um in a in a certain way

953
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,560
on mobile you cannot do that if you're

954
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
going to switch the phone off

955
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
if you're going to move to airplane mode

956
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,280
and you're going to be like that for

957
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,119
in in this case the default here is two

958
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,800
months but something

959
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,160
but you can change the default settings

960
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,160
then uh the the pegasus malware would

961
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
simply self-destruct

962
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,839
so you ruined the investigation by

963
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,079
taking the phone offline

964
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,520
how convenient so and during that time

965
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
it's not like the vendor is going to

966
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,720
help you to

967
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
to extract the file system um

968
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,480
now at best you're going to get a new

969
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,760
device but

970
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
if you're actually interested in the

971
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
cyber details the cyber attack details

972
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,160
and you want to see which other devices

973
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,079
in the organization are compromised

974
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
you cannot do that not easily and

975
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,760
you have to get very creative in there

976
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,000
some possibilities of inferring the

977
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,079
phone is compromised but

978
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,240
to actually get the payload like you're

979
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,920
used to from windows

980
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,359
um no no not so easy so let's talk about

981
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,400
common myths

982
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
that's that's really what's uh what's

983
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,400
repeating again and again in the false

984
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,359
advertising

985
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,720
of of uh the mobile security space

986
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,240
so the world garden this is the most

987
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,800
common myth people think okay if i'm

988
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,040
not downloading um applications from

989
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,119
third-party app stores

990
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,079
on android or if i'm not if i'm only

991
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,200
using the

992
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,560
world garden then i'm safe

993
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
but actually in reality it doesn't work

994
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,839
like that if you're concerned about

995
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,520
threat actors like nso

996
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
you feel concerned about threat actors

997
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,960
like um

998
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
various nation states and

999
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
they don't care about the app store they

1000
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
don't care about the play store

1001
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,160
they basically use either zero clicks or

1002
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,200
one clicks

1003
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,720
in one clicks and this is also from the

1004
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,680
pegasus

1005
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,960
product data sheet

1006
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,720
they say they have two types of

1007
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
infection methods one of them is ota

1008
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,079
overview

1009
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,359
it's a push message no cooperation or

1010
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,000
engagement

1011
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,520
no indication that it appears on the

1012
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,359
device it's silent and invisible and

1013
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,960
cannot be prevented

1014
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
again because there is only a single

1015
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
layer of defense

1016
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
which in this case it's it's apple of

1017
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,839
google

1018
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,160
and but if

1019
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
this for some reason is not available

1020
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
they have

1021
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,200
a one-click attack basically they send

1022
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,160
you a link

1023
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,200
uh via sms via email or whatnot

1024
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,680
as soon as you click on the link the

1025
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,980
installation is

1026
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,160
[Music]

1027
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,400
silent you don't see it you don't see

1028
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
anything different on the phone

1029
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
and your phone is compromised so really

1030
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,079
that's that's all it takes

1031
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,680
uh entering a website that is

1032
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,680
compromised whether if you did it

1033
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,240
intentionally or by clicking on a link

1034
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,720
or

1035
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,000
a water hall attack

1036
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,839
let's talk about sld and so these

1037
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,839
security research devices recently

1038
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,720
announced by

1039
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
apple in the last few years and there is

1040
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,560
a common myth that

1041
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,280
srd will help you in analyzing attacks

1042
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,119
it's actually going to only help you if

1043
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
you're looking for vulnerabilities

1044
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,280
not for attacks and so

1045
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,599
uh just to to to understand the

1046
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,480
difference

1047
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,920
you have 10 000 devices in the

1048
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,640
organization if and you have another sld

1049
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
device

1050
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,240
the sld device is not going to help you

1051
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
to find attacks on these 10 000 devices

1052
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
if these 10 000 devices any of them are

1053
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,160
compromised you wouldn't be able to

1054
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,440
access

1055
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,119
the the file system on these devices or

1056
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,079
the memory

1057
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,319
should you want to and do a deeper

1058
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,640
investigation

1059
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,560
the srd is going to help you however if

1060
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
you want to look for vulnerabilities in

1061
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,560
the platform itself

1062
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,800
but in that case why do you need sld you

1063
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,560
also have checkmate

1064
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,560
uh you don't you don't need a separate

1065
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,440
solution for that so it doesn't actually

1066
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,240
help you in the

1067
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,640
digital forensics and insurance response

1068
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
investigations it only help you to find

1069
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,079
vulnerabilities

1070
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,680
uh which you don't necessarily need that

1071
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,560
tool for it uh there are other ways so

1072
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,040
another myth is sod devices

1073
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,240
it's it's actually not helping any dfir

1074
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,640
or socks and then another myth is

1075
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,480
users should not be allowed to run

1076
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
elevated code and let's take a look at

1077
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,839
apple's own statements here and i

1078
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,119
actually took it from the

1079
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,359
epic games versus apple trial that

1080
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,480
happen is happening this month

1081
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,319
you we have root access on mac os

1082
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,319
and apple uh vp of developer relations

1083
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,760
claim that

1084
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,880
nobody at apple say that

1085
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,319
mac os is less secure than ios

1086
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,480
they also say that ios and mac os

1087
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,920
they allow you to keep the integrity

1088
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,240
and and they don't think that it's

1089
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,280
unsafe to use

1090
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,280
a mac um and

1091
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,720
you can run a mac

1092
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,880
applications worry free so

1093
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,599
wait a minute if on mac os we have local

1094
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,520
admin

1095
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,560
or specifically a root user

1096
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,119
and it's perfectly safe why we don't

1097
00:41:59,119 --> 00:41:59,920
have that

1098
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,880
ability on ios oh because users will do

1099
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,839
stupid things

1100
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,640
but guess what users can do stupid

1101
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
things without local admin

1102
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
users can simply install a vpn that

1103
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
turns all the traffic to the attackers

1104
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,640
users can install a fake profile or a

1105
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,520
work profile

1106
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,280
users can install a root certificate

1107
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,520
they can

1108
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
i mean with mdm you can also wipe a

1109
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,359
device and that's dangerous right like

1110
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,040
why is that allowed

1111
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,720
and don't tell me you want to evoke that

1112
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,160
too

1113
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,599
so really if if we have the same access

1114
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,520
on mac os there is no reason

1115
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,119
we shouldn't be able to have a local

1116
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,960
admin on ios

1117
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,920
same with chromebooks if we have boot on

1118
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,440
on chromebook questions we have

1119
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,800
root on um on android too

1120
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,960
another is also supposed to be open um

1121
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,240
i mean it's

1122
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,560
a bit disappointing the level of access

1123
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,359
that we're

1124
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,880
receiving as users um and that we cannot

1125
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,200
do all the things we could have done one

1126
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,000
if we had

1127
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,680
a full access to devices

1128
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,040
so what we want to do is we want to

1129
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
change that

1130
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,040
and we have announced the last few years

1131
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,440
uh

1132
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,000
the initiative of free the sandbox for

1133
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,839
the sandbox is a non-profit initiative

1134
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,839
and the goal is to promote open sandbox

1135
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,760
policy for device owners so device

1136
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,520
owners get local admin

1137
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,240
and they can do many things including

1138
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,800
security analysis including

1139
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,520
independent attestation of devices if

1140
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,359
the phone is compromised you can extract

1141
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,240
the payloads

1142
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,680
to prevent further misuse and this could

1143
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,160
also

1144
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,640
mean uh innovation in a way which we'll

1145
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,480
talk about in a second

1146
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,560
from security perspective we really need

1147
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,480
just a few things that will make our

1148
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:50,880
lives

1149
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,119
way way better um and of course we

1150
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,720
the best way to do it is to be able to

1151
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,040
do it at scale so socks around the world

1152
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,760
can benefit from that and can treat

1153
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,520
these endpoints that have microphone in

1154
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,680
the pocket of every employee

1155
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,760
in the same way they treat windows pcs

1156
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,400
that's how it should be done and even

1157
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,480
max or mac os

1158
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,800
so we want to have an administrator or

1159
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,599
root level

1160
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,720
user we need to have

1161
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
read only access to the entire file

1162
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,079
system and also

1163
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,960
read only access to the memory the file

1164
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,040
system one is for persistent attacks or

1165
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,960
payloads that are planted in the file

1166
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,680
in the file system and and the read-only

1167
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
memory access is for non-persistent

1168
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,720
attacks

1169
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,000
and so it's actually very beneficial

1170
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,520
to be able to analyze that because there

1171
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,119
are also some of these attacks

1172
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,839
actively being exploited out there and

1173
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,200
the upside deal is

1174
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,280
also that um

1175
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,880
liberated sandbox with local admin

1176
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,640
can actually lead to a lot of innovation

1177
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,400
that we cannot even think of

1178
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,480
i mean it can cause things like i mean

1179
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,160
if you look historically like

1180
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,400
virtual machines we wouldn't have

1181
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,520
virtual machines

1182
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,079
if there wasn't the option of running a

1183
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,520
local admin

1184
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,640
and applications on on windows

1185
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,160
if we would have many of the

1186
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,760
non-traditional tools that were not

1187
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,720
ported into

1188
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,760
mobile yet to be able to be ported there

1189
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,520
and new types of authentication

1190
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,359
new things that we cannot even imagine

1191
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,560
right now because

1192
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,440
there are so many brilliant people in

1193
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,079
this

1194
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,800
planet that have so many great ideas for

1195
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,520
innovation but they cannot

1196
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,960
do those on locked and restricted

1197
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,200
devices and it's a shame because these

1198
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,079
devices are just

1199
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,280
amazing right like we have

1200
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,839
internet access in our pocket we have

1201
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,440
cameras we have we have everything we

1202
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,000
wanted

1203
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
like if you talked to me 20 years ago

1204
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
and told me that will be the future i'll

1205
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,720
be like

1206
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,680
this is amazing so what can we do like

1207
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,520
we know okay this is a real issue this

1208
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,319
is a problem

1209
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,760
and if we're not going to do something

1210
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,839
right now the same issue is going to

1211
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,040
exist on pcs

1212
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,480
very soon on mac os very soon as well

1213
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,319
so we need to convince the vendors that

1214
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,319
opening the sandbox is actually a net

1215
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,119
positive

1216
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
for them and i know when vendors are

1217
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
going to watch this presentation

1218
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,359
uh so if there is one thing you need to

1219
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,720
take from this presentation

1220
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,440
is if you open up the sandbox and you

1221
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,400
actually do it first

1222
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,000
you increase your revenues what

1223
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,119
okay yes so if you open up the sandbox

1224
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,680
that will allow you to win many more

1225
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
cyod contracts that you're currently

1226
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,960
losing

1227
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,319
so once you get the csu stamp in an

1228
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,599
organization on a specific device model

1229
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,319
if they have full access to the device

1230
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,720
the sock can investigate those devices

1231
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,079
and those would be the recommended

1232
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,319
devices for coid contracts now cyd

1233
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,680
contracts are not

1234
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
necessarily just you know one person

1235
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,319
buying this device at the store

1236
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,079
uh it's thousands sometimes tens of

1237
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,920
thousands and even hundred 000 devices

1238
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,960
at once

1239
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
that are being sold to a specific

1240
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,000
company

1241
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,480
so this is very powerful play that can

1242
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
be done so if you need to take one thing

1243
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,240
out of this

1244
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,920
yes there is a problem yes there are

1245
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,079
some many issues yes this is wrong

1246
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,680
but you can actually increase your

1247
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,880
revenues by by opening up the sandbox so

1248
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,599
if you want to speak to your manager and

1249
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:34,800
tell them hey there's

1250
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,359
this great idea let's do that this is

1251
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,400
the way to convince

1252
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,720
internally a large corporation to do it

1253
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,599
and of course the bonus is that more

1254
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,880
attacks will get discovered

1255
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,800
more attacks will get discovered more

1256
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,400
exploits will be found

1257
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,720
the platform will be safer and further

1258
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
abuse of these vulnerabilities will not

1259
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,760
be possible

1260
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,800
so this is really the core

1261
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,800
of what liberating the sandbox

1262
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,800
for local users is about and

1263
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,400
give the users the option give the users

1264
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
the choice give organizations the

1265
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,480
possibility of really using

1266
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,520
mobile devices as a productivity tool

1267
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,480
now we are doing it anyway but because

1268
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,359
there is no competition

1269
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,319
over time i think it will change if

1270
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,000
devices are not going to be

1271
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,839
opened up so

1272
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,680
this is really something we have to do

1273
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,839
to make sure the ecosystem is healthier

1274
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,160
and of course this leads to unintended

1275
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
innovation this can lead to many many

1276
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,960
things

1277
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,839
depending on how flexible you want to be

1278
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,520
but

1279
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,800
i would go all in on this i think

1280
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,760
it's the user's device they deserve to

1281
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,480
choose

1282
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
what is running and what permission and

1283
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,680
not

1284
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,040
not anyone else now

1285
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,680
in case we are not able to convince the

1286
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,359
vice vendors

1287
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,119
there are also policy makers in the room

1288
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,480
there are people that can help us

1289
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,599
change the law so

1290
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,079
mobile the bottom line is that mobiles

1291
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,760
are becoming a significant risk

1292
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,280
three billion devices out there

1293
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,079
imagine what one rogue actor can do

1294
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,599
with a full zero click chain going wild

1295
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,740
i mean they can

1296
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,960
[Music]

1297
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,240
impact so many different devices out

1298
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,599
there at once

1299
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,880
it's just insane like this is a very big

1300
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,559
very big and very real risk so mobile is

1301
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,280
becoming a

1302
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,480
very very big risk for us we have to

1303
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,920
adapt the law

1304
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,400
to false any device vendor that

1305
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,599
generates a device

1306
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,800
with microphone with camera and with

1307
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
internet connectivity

1308
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,200
they should be providing local admin

1309
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,160
users

1310
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,359
for you for for device owners

1311
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,720
and basically security controls for

1312
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
organizations to be able to

1313
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,240
use these local admins you know to

1314
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,920
protect

1315
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,040
to analyze and protect these devices

1316
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,599
so this is really what's at stake here

1317
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,839
and this is what we have to change

1318
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,680
once one country will start it others

1319
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,759
will follow just like the gdpr

1320
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,160
um so why should we care basically

1321
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,240
i've i've won about mobile attacks in

1322
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,319
the last decade i've seen them

1323
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,440
firsthand so many times most of them

1324
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,359
were never published

1325
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,400
this is happening i'm seeing attacks

1326
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,119
on journalists i'm seeing attacks on

1327
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,640
researchers

1328
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,760
on politicians

1329
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,319
we are all using one of two devices

1330
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,160
either an android or an iphone that's it

1331
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,200
we don't have any other choice

1332
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,520
and

1333
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,640
apple and microsoft are looking at that

1334
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,880
and saying hey we got a way

1335
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
like they got away with that or in this

1336
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,319
case we got away with that

1337
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,119
in case of apple with not giving full

1338
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,720
access to the device maybe we can do the

1339
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,760
same on windows or mac os

1340
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,280
and some of the releases for example

1341
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,480
windows 10x

1342
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,359
is actually they have that like they

1343
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,240
they

1344
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,520
disabled access to the windows

1345
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,000
folder they don't have etw access

1346
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,800
anymore

1347
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,720
so you won't know about some of the

1348
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,640
things happening on that

1349
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,280
on that platform and that's really the

1350
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,960
direction things are going to so we

1351
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,640
really have to

1352
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,520
stand up right now and say hey this is

1353
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,480
wrong

1354
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,160
and we cannot have such a

1355
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,240
restricted sandbox policy

1356
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,400
and there's also if there's one thing

1357
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,760
i'd like you to take away from this

1358
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,200
presentation it's

1359
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,240
mobile attacks are way way way more

1360
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,200
common than what we think

1361
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,599
and i wish that someday the mobile

1362
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,599
device vendors will publish the real

1363
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,599
statistics on this it's

1364
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,240
it's just so much more common than what

1365
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,839
people think

1366
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,079
we need to have the option of choosing

1367
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,880
what we want on these devices

1368
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,839
so with that i'll wrap up thank you very

1369
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,319
much

1370
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,480
