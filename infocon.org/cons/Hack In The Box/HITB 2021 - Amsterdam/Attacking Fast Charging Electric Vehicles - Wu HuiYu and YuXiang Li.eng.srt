tencent security platform department

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
now we are focusing on security research

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
in the areas of

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,680
airt and cloud virtualization

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,199
you can visit our blog

42
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
let's move on today's topic i want to

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
talk is many different kids into four

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
parts

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
first part we will introduce the

46
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,680
electric

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
car charging technology and standard

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,280
the second part we will announce that

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,959
the attack surface of

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
negative charging in the third part we

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,720
will introduce what is x in the media

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
attack and finally we will introduce how

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,080
we

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,879
attack the pack and charge technology in

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,920
the real world

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
as everyone knows early speed expansion

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,920
of

58
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,680
electric car markets and promoted

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
the construction of the charging

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,800
instance

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
infrastructure dc charging is the main

62
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
charging technology in the future it has

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
higher charging power and in order to

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
confirm the charging voltage

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,879
and current the electric weaker and

66
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,360
the charging station will communicate

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
after being connected

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
to complete the handshake

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
there are different charging standards

70
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,040
in different

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
countries for example one negative car

72
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
in china must support the gpg standard

73
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
united car use compass to communicate

74
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
with charging pairs we are in most

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,280
part of euro ccs

76
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
standards are used and the electric

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,959
cars and charging pairs use a plc

78
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
to communicate with the exception of the

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,840
testnet

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
who has either on supercharger network

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
over the world

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
it uses a private communication protocol

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
in addition we also want to talk about

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
why we choose to study the

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,080
electric charging skills

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
the main reason that we find the

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
electric

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,000
records infrastructure is making

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,959
progress

90
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
towards a more intelligent more high

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,639
power

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
direction the construction

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,199
of the charging station is accelerating

94
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
all over the world but there is nettle

95
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
or research on the security of electric

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,199
vehicle infrastructure

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
in following section we will briefly

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
align the

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
attack surface of electric recurve

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
charging

101
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
first of all uv charging pairs

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,639
are also lt devices

103
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
which uranium have built in system

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
and operating interfaces we are facing

105
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
securities

106
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,199
in hardware systems platform

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,639
servers and communications

108
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
and our focus is on the security of the

109
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,720
communication

110
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
protocol between the neck cheek weaker

111
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,240
and the charging pad

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
this will be a new and interesting

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
exploration

114
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
the following picture shows the process

115
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,160
of

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
charging a car at a dc charging station

117
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
charge control communicates with the

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,960
and ms before charging to confirm the

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
parameter such as charging

120
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
voltage and current which

121
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,479
involves a lot of data exchange

122
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
so if we can implement a main

123
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
media attack we may be able to find

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,400
the vulnerabilities in vms

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
and the charging controls through body

126
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,840
or we can

127
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,759
analyze provides vertical

128
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
and bypass identity authentication

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
mechanism

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
or we can damage the car by temporary

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,560
with the charging voltage and current

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,319
next we will show the section about x in

133
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,680
the media attack

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
first we will talk about its

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
architecture

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,919
then we will talk about the challenges

137
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,440
and solutions

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
we encountered in the testing process

139
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,840
and finally we will share the quick test

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,880
conclusion

141
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,560
on tesla supercharger

142
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
in order to conduct security tests in

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,120
symphony and cabriony

144
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,599
we have given a tool called xcharger

145
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
the core of exchanger is a data

146
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
processing terminal

147
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
based on html mcu

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
or respect respiratory

149
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,000
which has united canvas message from dms

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,520
and the charging files all compass

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,080
message

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
cannot be transmitted normally until

153
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,319
they are transferred

154
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
through x charges which allow us to

155
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,560
mandatory

156
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,039
functioning and temporary combust

157
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:27,680
message

158
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
in your charging process

159
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,919
another feature is that we descend the

160
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,440
whole tour into a

161
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
20 inch bridge case

162
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
which has two charging circuits

163
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,199
one is connected to the charging pair

164
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
and the other is connected

165
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
to the negative weaker and the

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
high voltage current is directly

167
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
connected

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
and the only four com compass

169
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
communicates interface i exported to

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
ensure the

171
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
high voltage safety

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,160
next let's talk about why we do this and

173
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
the china chains we face when we do

174
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
security research

175
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,560
the most important thing is that

176
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
it should be able to ensure the

177
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
personal safety and the weaker safety

178
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
this charging can reach a voltage

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,039
of up to 750 watts

180
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,279
or a current of 120 mp

181
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
once the shoot once a short current

182
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,040
accuracy is very dangerous for the test

183
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
and the car secondly

184
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
we hope the attack equipment should be

185
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,080
honey

186
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,920
complex comfortable suitable for

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
all electric vehicles with chinese pc

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
charging standard

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,839
instead of requiring customers

190
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,160
customization for each blend of electric

191
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,720
cards

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
or charging pairs we also find the

193
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
compact communication

194
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,640
requires no latency and many media

195
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
attacks

196
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,880
into to ensure the brains

197
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,920
we are not good job

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,160
we rented a tesla module for testing

199
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
and we found that its charging port

200
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,399
exported

201
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
the command interface with a separate

202
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
stack which means

203
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,000
that we may be able to discard

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,040
disconnect

205
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
the origin connection in the trunk

206
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
to achieve a main media attack

207
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
but the problem is that may need

208
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
to the night damage which doesn't

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,800
seem sweet for such a operation on a

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
limited record

211
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
in addition we have also thought about

212
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
transforming tesna's

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
gb dc adapter for pocket

214
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
capture but we believe that these

215
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
also have a security risk and

216
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
this doesn't apply upland

217
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
to other records

218
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
a perfect solution we have given is the

219
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,880
equipment

220
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
shown below you can see that

221
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
it has two charging circuits

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,399
one end is connected to the inaudible

223
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,040
the other end is connected to the

224
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
charging connector

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
the compass interface of bmis

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
and the cameras interface of the

227
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,399
charging pair

228
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,560
are all exported are all exported

229
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,920
on the surface and at the same time

230
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,279
we have customers uh storage

231
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,320
plug charging cable to connect

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,440
the equipment under the car this

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
equipment is designed by us

234
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
and made by professional windows

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
in shenzhen china which can ensure the

236
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
safety of

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
high water age power use

238
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
there are many open source tools

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,399
available for

240
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,360
combat the mandatory buzzing and

241
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
temporary

242
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
to use both the raspberry pi and the

243
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,399
two-way cam

244
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,760
extension board we can use

245
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
python to develop a test for

246
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,480
testing from work on the built-in ubuntu

247
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,399
system and due to the limited

248
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
time we will release more details and

249
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
codes in the future

250
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
we use exchange to do a quick test

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,760
on interest not supercharged in china

252
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,800
and the test

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
results verified that the device can

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
capture the message steps funny but we

255
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,160
do not have

256
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,880
any more test just because we do not

257
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,200
have

258
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
the dbc file to translate the combust

259
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
message

260
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,160
we found that some of the message in

261
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,880
commerce

262
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
compass communication between

263
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,800
supercharger and waterstream

264
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,600
use a private verticals and some message

265
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,320
conform to the gpg standard

266
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
when testing with the modestry they are

267
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:53,839
a

268
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
high property that it will not be

269
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,040
able to charge successfully the reason

270
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,720
is still being unaddressed if you want

271
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
to

272
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,279
so if you want to reverse the complete

273
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,880
protocol it may be a bad choice to

274
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,680
analyze

275
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,279
the firmware of bms or supercharger

276
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,000
in addition to the superstar

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
supercharger

278
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
we spend more time in public charging

279
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
stations

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,959
in following part we will share how to

281
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,399
attack the

282
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
track and charging technology

283
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,440
in public charging stations in china

284
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
first we will introduce the print simple

285
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
of pack and charge

286
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,680
and how to use x charge to attack it

287
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
to achieve free charging finally

288
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,000
we will give some security otherwise and

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
briefly announce that

290
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,240
the future change of charging technology

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
black and chart is a new way of

292
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,839
automating

293
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
payment for ebay charging users do not

294
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,240
need

295
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
to sweep their cards or scan codes

296
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,040
just connect the charging pair to the

297
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,600
weaker

298
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
charging port to automatically

299
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,279
complement

300
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,240
the identity authentication payments

301
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,000
that build their own charging pairs

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
such as the test nut priority

303
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,199
communication

304
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,000
and authentication protocol can be used

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,720
to

306
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,600
ensure that security of plug can charge

307
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,320
and there are different implement

308
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
implementation

309
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,880
of plug and charge

310
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
the plan a is install a camera near the

311
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,399
charging panel to verify the

312
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,440
record lessons plans for

313
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
authentication the plan b is install

314
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,800
a rfid tag at the position of the

315
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
electric recoil charging circuit

316
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
and read the target content for

317
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
authentication when the charging gun

318
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
connected

319
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,600
the fancy the sdk is the

320
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
sdk provided by a charging power

321
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,839
operator

322
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,600
is built into the intelligent system of

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
nitric vehicles and the authentication

324
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,120
is

325
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
automatically complete complicated

326
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
when the weaker reach the

327
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
charging station and open the charging

328
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,880
cover

329
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,639
another last plan is the weakest

330
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
wheel number is transmitted for

331
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,079
authentication

332
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,758
during the charging candlestick process

333
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,639
considering the capability

334
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
and cost some public

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,120
charging stage operators have chosen

336
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,480
to use rear end to complete

337
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,680
recall identity authentication on basis

338
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,720
of

339
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,759
gpt standard operators

340
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
do not realize the via is a

341
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,040
security is not a security

342
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
authentication in a insecure

343
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
combust communication gpt standard is

344
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,759
the chinese standard for electrical

345
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,120
recoil battery

346
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
charging camber charging standard

347
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,560
gpg is based on sae

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,639
and uses the campus with a

349
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,880
point-to-point

350
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,519
connection between the charger and the

351
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,320
battery

352
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,000
manager system a transmission rate of

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,919
250 kbits per second

354
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
is used by default

355
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,079
charging communication involves both

356
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,799
vms and the charging control

357
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,839
with the gpg protocol communication

358
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,200
is divided into following parts during

359
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,600
the

360
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
charging process

361
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,120
in the handshake because recognization

362
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
the charging connection check is

363
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
complimented

364
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
and general information such as protocol

365
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
vision and

366
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,919
vehicle information for example the

367
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
battery temp weaker and dedication

368
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,840
number

369
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,039
and so on is changed what

370
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
we are most concerned about is

371
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,280
that during the handshake

372
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
the bmx will transmitted the vm number

373
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,520
to the charging pair

374
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
after actual testing we use contours

375
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,440
and the dbcpr to successfully translate

376
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,840
all messages during the charging process

377
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,960
we found the emails of electro record

378
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,160
transmitted

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
the request we end to the charging pair

380
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
for a direct case

381
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
for identity authentication in yame

382
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,880
in the brm message during the handshake

383
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
reconnaissation

384
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,480
the following is the complete plug and

385
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
charge the

386
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
architecture first the car owner needs

387
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,320
to register and abandon the weaker

388
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
server number on

389
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,520
charging pair operators application

390
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,918
and the accept and expert

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,039
automatically impairment secondly

392
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,320
when the car owner is charging he only

393
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,720
needs

394
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
to direct an implant and

395
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
charging gun into the magnetic

396
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
card to charge the charging pair

397
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
will apply upload the wheel

398
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
transmitted from the vms to

399
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,880
operators to the operator's

400
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,240
cloud server under the operator we have

401
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,360
query and

402
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,440
return the user's credence

403
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,039
crescent corresponding

404
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,280
to the vn in the background database

405
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,160
after the charging pair reserves the

406
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,039
user's

407
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,240
credence it will it will

408
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,360
start charging and automatically pay

409
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,479
pay at the end of the chart

410
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,559
weaker authentication number is a unique

411
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,120
code

412
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
include including a three number used

413
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
by optimal automotive

414
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,440
industry to 20

415
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
and the intervention workers

416
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,240
the biggest problem is we are in

417
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
either public blind text information

418
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,679
with specific coding rulers and can also

419
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,000
be

420
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
obtained from the front or in the shade

421
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,639
of the car

422
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,039
in order to configure the attack spree

423
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,960
script uh quickly we have

424
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
written a tool that it means the

425
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,240
function

426
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
includes the temporary of

427
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,039
wear and charging voltage and current

428
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
it also supports the vms termination

429
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,919
so that we can test the charging panel

430
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,120
with the other weaker

431
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
the following is the ruler

432
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,840
of exchange in the attacks process

433
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
it can catch the message

434
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
between the card and the charging pair

435
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,679
in order to verify our tours

436
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,640
in the real world we wanted five

437
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
electrical cars

438
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,440
of different models and the test

439
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,760
new temporal charging stations that

440
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,720
support

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,159
plaque and charge we verified that

442
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
after obtaining the after overturn

443
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
we end on the windshield of the weaker

444
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,159
the charging pair can be successfully

445
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,240
attached by exchange

446
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
to achieve free charging

447
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,679
and now all of the availability

448
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,559
we found have been notified to the

449
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,440
renter and

450
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,640
fix it okay

451
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
my party is over the following time will

452
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,039
be shared

453
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,158
by my college

454
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,559
thank you thanks i will continue to

455
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
share the following part

456
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,120
in this part i will give some security

457
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,840
otherwise

458
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
and introduce some of the latest

459
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,240
charging standards

460
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,960
but charging pies operators can display

461
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,760
a risk

462
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
control system to crack off battery

463
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,000
information

464
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
such as battery time capacity

465
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,679
manufacturers product status

466
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,799
battery pack serial numbers numbers of

467
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,000
charge transmit during the charging

468
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
handshake process

469
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,880
of vehicles that use the plug and charge

470
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
function

471
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,320
and generates the corresponding

472
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
electricity

473
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,280
we are called fingerprint information

474
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,159
since the attacker cannot knows the

475
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,400
detailed battery informations of the

476
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
target vehicles in other words

477
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,720
simply tampering with the vrn cannot

478
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
pass the fingerprint information

479
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
verification and the risk control

480
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
systems can

481
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,080
acquire it detects the attacks and

482
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,919
black it the first plane other one

483
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
is low cost no need for additional

484
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,159
hardware modification and its

485
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,039
disadvantage

486
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,279
is because part of the battery

487
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,120
information such as

488
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,159
battery pack stereo number charging eye

489
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,120
charging times is an optional

490
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
transmission

491
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,320
items in gbt27930

492
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
and part of the battery information of

493
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,679
the

494
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
of the specific models is public

495
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,600
so the risk control systems may not be

496
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,320
able to

497
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,919
crack enough information to insure

498
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,440
security

499
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,080
security

500
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,520
for the two-way authentication scheme

501
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,000
charging

502
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
price operators need to code

503
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,240
operates with electricity vehicles

504
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
manufacturers to

505
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799
ensure security this may

506
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,360
require adding a public key transmission

507
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,200
function to uh

508
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
to the vehicle's vms from various

509
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679

526
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,679
challenge charting support plus and

527
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,480
trust

528
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
v2x and other new technology

529
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,200
applications some of the security risks

530
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,840
mentioned in our talks may be reserved

531
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,960
in addition we also see another new

532
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,840
standard

533
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,360
iso 1511a

534
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,840
is a standard for vehicle to create

535
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,159
communication

536
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,760
use symmetric encryptions

537
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
and digital snatchers

538
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,960
to ensure the securities of

539
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,840
communication

540
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,279
between electric cars and charging

541
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,559
stations

542
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
and supports plug and charge it use plc

543
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,520
communications

544
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
which is mainly used in europe

545
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,320
through the discussions of these trains

546
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
we are very happy to see that security

547
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,559
has become

548
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
must be considered in

549
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,799
these standards we believe that

550
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,919
in the near futures when these new

551
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,360
technologies and new standards applies

552
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
in the real world

553
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,279
they will promote the security

554
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,240
developments of

555
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,600
the entire electric vehicles charging

556
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,000
industry

557
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
okay that's all thank you for listening

558
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
and if you have any questions you can
