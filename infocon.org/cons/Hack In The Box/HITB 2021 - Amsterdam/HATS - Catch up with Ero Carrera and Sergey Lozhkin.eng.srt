1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,440
uh

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,160
we've got eero carrera with us now here

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,840
i was going

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,400
hey good thanks for having me oh it's

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,199
our pleasure

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,640
how's everything with you uh good good

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
well as good as things can be in you

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,320
know in the current situation but pretty

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,119
good

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,640
wonderful so for the folks who do not

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,039
know ero is one of our trainers with the

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,760
hitb sect train and he would be having a

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
training

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
thing next month or in two months time i

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,000
believe

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,079
but the main reason he is here is talk

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,600
about threat intelligence

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
and ais and all that good stuff

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
uh spiro why don't you give us a

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
background by yourself before we start

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,320
okay i'll try to keep it brief uh but uh

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
i've been i've been around uh

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,800
20 years rounding up a bit uh rounded

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,719
down actually

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
on this industry i worked in uh i

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:00:59,920
started

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,320
securing doing malware analysis power

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
research

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
then spent some years working with

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
harvard flake in dynamics

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
and the whole team there and virustotal

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,360
and

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,680
and the last 10 years i spent at google

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,479
uh doing

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,159
doing large-scale malware analysis and

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,200
and then

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
focusing more on threat intelligence and

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
automating

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
threat intelligence analysis with the

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
kind of tools you have at a place like

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,479
google

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
so you know i've gone i've touched on

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
different parts of the whole infosec

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
spectrum and had a lot of fun doing it

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
nice so you said the tools they have at

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
google right so what

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,040
would be the main difference between a

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
ti team in google and maybe

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
a normal mnc or a company trying to

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
mature their ti program

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
that's that's a really good question um

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,079
but i think

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,200
a big difference revolves around um how

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,159
normalized

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,680
at a place like google the use of large

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,799
scale databases is uh and i think when i

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,360
talked

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,959
when i was working there and i talked to

59
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
people outside

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,680
for within google you take for granted

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
that you're gonna just put

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
all of your data whatever that data is

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,000
that you use for threat intel

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,720
in a database and all of your data can

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,920
be billions of

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
rows terabytes and terabytes of data and

67
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,280
just

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
query as many times as you need

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,720
instantly pretty much

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,599
and as you may imagine that makes

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
certain kind of workflows

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,239
incredibly fast and powerful while the

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,360
only thing that you have

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
is just a fancy just a fancy uh

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
database and but but that's such an

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
incredible difference to have that that

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
foundational tooling at that scale um

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
it's funny because

79
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
it doesn't really have mean that you

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
have to push you know crazy machine

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
machine learning uh or you know any any

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,200
especially fancy techniques you just

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
have very basic

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,680
tools at an extreme scale are so

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,959
powerful of course

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,560
then you can build on top of that but i

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
would say that's a pretty

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
key uh difference just how much of an

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,840
enabler

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
a good infrastructure can be

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
right and they always say right with the

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,560
tools you need the expertise

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
of the people to operate it so i mean

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
what kind of

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
uh background or expertise are we

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
talking about here

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,120
as for the team you mean so the team

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
actually the threat analysis group was

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
i think i was lucky to to end up working

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,319
with such a team uh because i think it

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,080
was

102
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
probable and probably has parallels in

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
other in other organizations

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
uh at the level of google but you know

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
google being google uh it was

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
when i joined a team of around 20 people

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
and we had

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,280
people coming from different you know

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
government intelligence agencies we had

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
some of the top reverse engineers

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,680
and vulnerability researchers in the

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,879
world

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,280
we have amazing threat intelligence

114
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,959
analysts

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
with domain expertise in the cyber world

116
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,040
and so it was you know of course you

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
joined the tooling with the

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,918
level of skills and the focus there and

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,000
it was in a way easy to get some good

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,040
results

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,840
um so yeah so it was a varied and

122
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
extremely skilled team and it was quite

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
a privilege to work there for

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
for the time that i did nice nice and

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,720
and

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
i think with ti the main the main

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
importance is the freshness of the data

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
right

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,960
helps a lot but uh but i wouldn't

130
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,680
actually um

131
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
uh you know discard the fact that having

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
some sort of history and background is

133
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
useful as well of course you know

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
there is limited use to having you know

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
indicators from 10 years ago but having

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
having a database that

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
keeps some context maybe for a few years

138
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
sometimes sometimes

139
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
some actors reuse infrastructure for a

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,800
long time

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,639
so of course fresh data is relevant to

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,080
study current threats and current

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
ongoing attacks

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
but if you want to be able to read a

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
fuller picture of threat

146
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
actors across time how they evolve

147
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759
keeping that historical context

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,759
as much as possible as much as you can

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
afford it in your databases

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
and as well as doesn't make the

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,600
intelligence workflow more complex

152
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
i think there is value in that okay and

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,919
how does ai

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,560
or ml play a part in this

155
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
in a way i think i sometimes may sound a

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
bit as i'm not a disbeliever but i

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,479
skeptical about

158
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
aim and ml while you know i'm teaching a

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
training on that so kind of maybe a

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
little bit

161
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,520
funny but uh but the thing is because i

162
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,639
grew you know

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,280
my background is as a hacker you know as

164
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
a teenager i was cracking software and

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
and you know

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
and always learning things by myself so

167
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,840
i came to machine learning

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
uh in the beginning with a lot of

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
skepticism thinking you know this cannot

170
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
do magic

171
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,639
i think that's the truth it cannot do

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,160
magic but it can automate

173
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,919
a lot of things and if you're a person

174
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,360
that you know once you understand the

175
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
problem you rather be working on

176
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,080
something new

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,919
and machine learning is a fantastic way

178
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
of actually uh in a very principled way

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
teach or have the computer learn some

180
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
patterns in

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,919
the workflow that you're doing or in the

182
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
data to actually then have a computer do

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
it repeatedly so you don't

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
waste your time and you can move to

185
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
something else so i think within the

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,639
threat intelligence

187
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
scape and you know a bit malware

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
analysis with actually

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
analyzing and working with intelligence

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,440
techniques

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,479
need you know glorified mach

192
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
automated uh automation glorified

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
automation

194
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
machine learning or you know full-on ai

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,280
ai

196
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
neural networks there's a broader

197
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,080
spectrum of you know complexity there

198
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,120
but uh there are pockets there are

199
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,280
specific niches where many of these

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
techniques can be applied and will

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,759
you know boost and empower your team it

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
will it will

203
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
free resources the human resources are

204
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,120
always the most expensive

205
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,280
getting skilled people and then making

206
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
good use of

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
those people so applying machine

208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,919
learning applying automation in the

209
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,960
right spots

210
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
frees humans to do the right thing and

211
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
you know invest in

212
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
invest their brains in in the

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,919
interesting parts of the problem so i

214
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,479
think that's

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,319
the interplay of of using humans well

216
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
and have the machines do what the humans

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,680
don't want to do

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,599
and it's routine i think that's that's

219
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,680
that's the ideal case

220
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,840
right i see him just in time for the ai

221
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
particularly

222
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
you know when it comes to modeling right

223
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
like the feature extraction kind of

224
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
thing right like how do you even begin

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,639
to

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,319
decide what's going to be modeled what

227
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,840
you're going to model your

228
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,479
i'm very happy that you use such a

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,319
graphic language because i guess

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,599
i entirely agree and actually um yeah

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
you you just get to spot uh i mean i

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,200
didn't want to reveal too many things

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
from my training but

234
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,919
no but uh we're gonna be definitely

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,519
touching on that because i think and

236
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,479
actually

237
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,279
i've sat in pitches for startup where

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,839
you know

239
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
the big boss was uh selling the idea

240
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
we have lots of data we have the best

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
and now we put it together magic happens

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,200
as you know as a practitioner kind of me

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
wanting to raise my hands

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
maybe not that easy because it's exactly

245
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
that you know you you will have the best

246
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,880
machine learning algorithms you will

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,200
have

248
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
expertise and still you'll spend

249
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
90 of the time debug i mean there is

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
such a thing as debugging your data

251
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
because you'll try

252
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,399
you realize that the data is not the

253
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
screen as you thought always

254
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
happens and then you'll have to go back

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
if your workflow allows you

256
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
to what data was wrong why is it wrong

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
was it entered incorrectly was it

258
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
labeled incorrectly

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
this is a broad spectrum of things that

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
can be wrong with the data

261
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
uh was it acquired incorrectly a problem

262
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
with the sensor a problem with the tool

263
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,720
that generated the data

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
uh different tools will generate alarms

265
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
or trigger or generate locks for

266
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
different events not necessarily in a

267
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
consistent way and if you throw it in

268
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
the same bucket and try to

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,839
learn from it you're not or you're gonna

270
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
learn really weird things

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,920
so having a very clear workflow from

272
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
data

273
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
to to classification to to the result of

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
the pipeline and being able to go

275
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
whenever you find cases that don't make

276
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,839
any sense

277
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,240
being able to go back to what data

278
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
generated

279
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
that that label that labeling that

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,959
verdict from the

281
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,760
from the system critical and that's why

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
personally

283
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
the times we have applied machining

284
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
machine learning

285
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,519
to to threat intelligence generally

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,800
we've been

287
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,680
shied away from the class of algorithms

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
that tend to be more opaque

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
like neural networks are fantastic for

290
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
some specific tasks

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,399
like image recognition but they are

292
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
knowingly hard to debug in that if the

293
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
africa if a classification is wrong

294
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
it's very hard to ask the machine

295
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
learning algorithm the model

296
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
why did you do this well there are a

297
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
class of algorithms

298
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
the simpler ones if you will but it's

299
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
still extremely powerful logistic

300
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,920
vibration uh basin

301
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,079
networks random forest where you can

302
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,920
actually go back to the algorithm and

303
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,040
see what weights

304
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
were wrong and from those weights see

305
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
what data actually

306
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,399
what where those inputs and then

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
actually iterate and i think

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
in this kind of workflows that iteration

309
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
that being able to go from

310
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,680
bad classification to what the data

311
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
fixing understanding the data better and

312
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
have that loop a few times

313
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,240
that's where it gets you to something

314
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,640
that you can actually deploy

315
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
yeah and also i mean the fine tuning the

316
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,120
the parameters as well

317
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,360
in itself is an art you know what i mean

318
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,720
it's just attempting to converge

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,440
properly

320
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,200
and not oversee it yes yes entirely so

321
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
so sorry that to your original question

322
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,959
about future extraction and

323
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,519
future engineering uh that that's that's

324
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
a mix of you know having good domain

325
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
expertise in your team

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
because if you have you know and i've

327
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,519
seen cases where you get

328
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,040
really good machine learning engineers

329
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
and throw them into a problem where

330
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
none of them have a lot of domain

331
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,600
expertise and sure they're going to make

332
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
the algorithms fly

333
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
but but they don't unders they will not

334
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,639
understand in the beginning

335
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,959
the intricacies of the data you know is

336
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,880
it is it something coming from a sandbox

337
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
what does it mean to have this api call

338
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
on this argument how can you debug that

339
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,279
so having

340
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
somebody that is an expert on

341
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
understanding the data

342
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,959
helps so that helps that feature

343
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
engineering that first connect the

344
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,240
thoughts of like this should help these

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
students

346
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
and then yes you need that as well

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
expertise in machine learning to to

348
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,959
to understand the behavior of the

349
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
algorithm is it fitting right is it

350
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,079
overfitting

351
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,639
do you is the if you're using a neural

352
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,000
network is it deep enough

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
do you have enough parameters to encode

354
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
this kind of information

355
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
do you need you know two classes you

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
need a multi-class classifier

357
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,519
all of those things is something that

358
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,040
where you actually need the domain

359
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,959
the domain expertise in machine learning

360
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,880
as well so having these kind of teams

361
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
with the real expertise well combined

362
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,320
not trivial are there already jupyter

363
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,839
notebooks and stuff that people can just

364
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:48,160
like

365
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
you know fire up and then just pump in

366
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,839
some whatever excellence or any

367
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,839
structured data or some sort into it

368
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
are doing something interesting uh there

369
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,000
are i mean

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
and depending on the tools that you go

371
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,320
that can always be a first attempt right

372
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,639
just

373
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,959
to get some of the tensorflow get maybe

374
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,639
something similar like sci-fi

375
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
to uh psychic to start with

376
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,040
and you know load the csv

377
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
file load the exercise apply some of the

378
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
basic algorithms

379
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
see where they fail understand this i

380
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,160
mean and i'm talking

381
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,680
really simple maybe some of them don't

382
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
take uh like continuous features maybe

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,279
some of them don't take discrete

384
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
features i understand that

385
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,760
understand why that algorithm doesn't do

386
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
that and

387
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
why do you want to do it do you need

388
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
discreet features for this

389
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,079
so i mean i started knowing nothing

390
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,519
about machine learning cities like

391
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,600
regression classification clustering

392
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,199
all of these are different ways of you

393
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
know different outputs of machine

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
learning algorithms so

395
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,199
you know do you have some kind of drag

396
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,320
and drop

397
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
things that you can try but you need to

398
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,240
develop as well the expertise

399
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,199
and and some of the some expectations

400
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,560
and intuitions about

401
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
what what each of the major algorithms

402
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
can output

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
to already start on the right track

404
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
what about uh have you looked at capsule

405
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
networks is it like that seems to be the

406
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
new right it's lsd and stuff

407
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
combined with deep yeah

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
so i i have not most of the data sets

409
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,920
that i

410
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
worked with personally um

411
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
were not necessarily time dependent

412
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,279
in the in the way that an lstm you know

413
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,040
ls games i think could have worked

414
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,360
well never tried that but in the case of

415
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
analyzing a

416
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,399
behavioral traits on applications over

417
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
time so i never you know

418
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,160
the problem specific problems where i

419
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
where i worked were

420
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,839
actually recognizing uh code to

421
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,920
to aid massive disassembly so at google

422
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,959
we disassembled

423
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,279
all the software that you know we got

424
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
from all of the sources

425
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,560
so doing that at scale being able to

426
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
recognize all the different compiler

427
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,079
patterns so where where to start

428
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
disassembling is actually a problem that

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
this either doesn't scale out that far

430
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,399
right so we had to attack it on our own

431
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,399
so so we built some models to recognize

432
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,760
code and that works surprisingly well

433
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,680
but it was a very specific

434
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,240
niche problem that gave a lot of returns

435
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
but you know

436
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
who needs to build a machine learning

437
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,399
model to disassemble not that many

438
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,519
people by the google

439
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,920
with it and then uh machine learning

440
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
around around threat intelligence around

441
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
actually

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
ranking evidence so again that was not a

443
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,040
very specific

444
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
an instance of a problem where uh

445
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,160
anything from the family of thick

446
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
networks was applicable uh i know

447
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,079
they were being used for the standard

448
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,399
image recognition ocr in documents and

449
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
extracting texts

450
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
you know works and but not necessarily

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,399
for

452
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
i don't remember instances in our

453
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
workflows where we were using them to

454
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
in the intelligence analysis workflow

455
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
because

456
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
because as well the decisions that were

457
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
made there you know about

458
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,440
some infrastructure being related to an

459
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
actor sometimes then

460
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
actions we needed to take actions on

461
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
that infrastructure

462
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
maybe it means sinkhole in it maybe it

463
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
means something

464
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,880
different and that we need to be able to

465
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
to debug those actions if

466
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
lawyers later come and say why do you do

467
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,519
this we can't say the machine said so

468
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
we need to you know i mean i wish we

469
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,160
need to say

470
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
yeah uh we need to be able to say you

471
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
know we use we use some techniques

472
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
but this is the trail of evidence so we

473
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,600
need algorithms that could provide

474
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
you know the decision as well as why

475
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
that reasoning

476
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
was reached so it can be justified so

477
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
when when the stakes are high in the

478
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
decision

479
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,240
sometimes that conditions the kind of

480
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
algorithms that you can use

481
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,000
you know sorry just let me post you

482
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,480
there for a quick second um we just got

483
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
denise who joined in as well

484
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
dennis is a fellow trainer uh with

485
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,720
itself train and hitv

486
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,399
sect train who is championing

487
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,800
security programs i'm not wrong hey

488
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
dennis how's it going

489
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
um as usual you know it's quite

490
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,599
spontaneous but anyway we are here

491
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
exactly yeah so just feel free to jump

492
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,720
into the topic right it's it's

493
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,119
we're just keeping it casual so if you

494
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,480
have anything to import we can go with

495
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,919
that we'll obviously come to you in

496
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,839
short bit as well

497
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
and uh just just uh listening a little

498
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
bit about the some models that you train

499
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
something you're trying to extract

500
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,480
something

501
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
and uh you know that's a quite hot topic

502
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
because because you need to

503
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
protect machine learning by itself also

504
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
so that's why i think in the industry

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
you need to keep your model safe you

506
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
need to keep the

507
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,039
personal data if we it's talking about

508
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
the the personal data

509
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
in uh data sets so we need to protect it

510
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
so maybe maybe next training will be

511
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,000
also

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
how to protect things that protect us

513
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
you know actually you know uh then that

514
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
is usually an important point because

515
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,520
last year we had a paper about reversing

516
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
the black box models right because like

517
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,000
everybody says

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,280
ai is like a black box right but you

519
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
just put some data inside it and then

520
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,160
some answer comes out and you're like

521
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,600
how why did you come up with dante i

522
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
have no idea bro but that the answer

523
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,760
came out

524
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
but being able to reverse those models

525
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,799
is cool

526
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,720
because then you can learn from it but

527
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,440
it becomes a an ip issue when you start

528
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,559
reversing like

529
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
self-driving cars and figure out how

530
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,480
those

531
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
cars are making the decisions on whether

532
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
they you know

533
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,640
go faster or whatever right like so the

534
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
reverse engineering of ai models in

535
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,520
itself was like a super super

536
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,320
interesting area

537
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,559
and i think right now a lot of machine

538
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,600
learning practitioners

539
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
they only release partial code but the

540
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,679
actual you know you want the weights

541
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,919
because like google has tpus and they've

542
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,559
got like

543
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
amazing amount of resources right i've

544
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
got a stupid-ass nvidia gpu

545
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,960
i can't do anything with that right so

546
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
but at the end of the day the that fully

547
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
compiled model right like with the

548
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
weights that's what everybody wants and

549
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,919
then the retainable layer so everything

550
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,480
at the

551
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
all the way up to the last layer and

552
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,120
then i just have to retrain just a

553
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,080
little bit

554
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
but folks don't release that

555
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,840
yeah how i wrote how man give us some

556
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,480
rope

557
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
that's the secret sauce no but it is it

558
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,080
is

559
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,799
true it is an actual problem and uh not

560
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,200
just

561
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
about representing the model itself in

562
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
some interest instances that can be the

563
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
problem but um but as well

564
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,000
sometimes you know it's the oracle

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
problem if if an attacker can actually

566
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
guess why the model knows what it knows

567
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
maybe it actually is a window to the

568
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
data that you have about that

569
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
and uh and in many instances i you know

570
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
i've been in places where you can't

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,080
really

572
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
publicly admit to a certain verdict or

573
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,120
judgment

574
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
just because that will tell the

575
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,000
adversary what you know about them and

576
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
it's more valuable

577
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
to keep that secret and keep collecting

578
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
information or tracking them

579
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
and actually revealing it so so i mean

580
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,400
not just

581
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
the model itself by by the pro

582
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
intellectual property that it encodes

583
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
that actually because of the information

584
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
that it may reveal you're able to

585
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,799
acquire

586
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,679
is is worth protecting so so you know as

587
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,080
well that depends what what the model

588
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
what the mod you know if it's trained on

589
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
images that are publicly available

590
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
probably not so important to protect but

591
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,919
if a lot of

592
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,400
uh you know private information goes

593
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,360
into that model

594
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,200
user private or company private

595
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
information it's it becomes really

596
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
valuable and something you have to

597
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
protect even protected

598
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
at the amount at the level of limiting

599
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
the amount of inferences you allow

600
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
other people to do with because then

601
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
they could query query query query and

602
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
kind of like

603
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,760
learn everything that the mobile knows

604
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
which is something you don't want them

605
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
to do

606
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,799
or another attack vector if you have

607
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,320
some some decision making processes that

608
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
relies on your on your network

609
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,919
if you can affect the process you don't

610
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,000
need the the internals you just need to

611
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
check that somehow

612
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
to change the decision and that's it

613
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,400
this

614
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
was successful so it means that decision

615
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
making process is quite important also

616
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,320
nature and i mean you can influence the

617
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,919
output of what the model is going to

618
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,000
detect then the operator is going to

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,880
take that as

620
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,600
gospel right the machine yes there are

621
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
no traps here bro everything all good

622
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,840
and yeah the operator is going to say

623
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
yeah it's all good right know they came

624
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,000
out

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
fine so then nobody's going to verify it

626
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
or you all have the reverse where you

627
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,400
know

628
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,520
this is also another

629
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,200
another false flag basically right you

630
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,880
can't false flags in the data because

631
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
you know the model is going to pick up

632
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
for that or it's kind of bias towards

633
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,039
that so

634
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
you can then hide your stuff below it

635
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,880
right

636
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,440
it's interesting i love the ai stuff

637
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,480
[Music]

638
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
yeah and actually just recently uh

639
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
learned about this this class of

640
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
problems as well

641
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
where where the attack is actually on

642
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,360
the on the

643
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
computational part of the inference like

644
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
the models when they process the input

645
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,000
data

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
to make an inference they there are

647
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,679
paths that are more expensive

648
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,520
at the level of the weights and the part

649
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
of the model that is invoked to actually

650
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,640
make the inference

651
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,559
so depending how you construct the data

652
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,640
you can actually overload or

653
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,120
lead to extreme costs at the level of

654
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,559
making the inferences how

655
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,720
depending how you present the data so

656
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
you can you know do a denial of service

657
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,120
of a model just by presenting you know

658
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,080
extremely

659
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
expensive to evaluate examples

660
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,559
of course that requires being able to

661
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,559
you know

662
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,480
have an understanding of how that model

663
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
works and what's expensive for it but

664
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,679
probably you can just do by trial and

665
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,080
error

666
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,158
end up in finding those little things

667
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,080
yeah that's going to be quite

668
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
interesting and it's almost impossible

669
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,679
to solve again because i

670
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
how the hell are you going to how do you

671
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
how do you model that trap

672
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
how do you say what is actually valid

673
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,600
and what is that right like

674
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,880
somebody's just going to be sending very

675
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,039
small bits

676
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,520
and you can probably probably you can

677
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
limit

678
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,080
talking with some distance from

679
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,159
understanding that problem here but uh

680
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
the probably you could you could try to

681
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,120
you know the same way as you deal with

682
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,440
sim

683
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
sleep bombs right or you used to or you

684
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,080
try just you know some things you try to

685
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
when try to decompress them go over a

686
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,880
certain size kill the process

687
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
so in a way you know you you kind of

688
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,200
limit the number of resources per

689
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
job per inference job so that if if it

690
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,960
goes crazy

691
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,640
then you can assume maybe an attack is

692
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
going on i'm just just you know but

693
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,159
i don't know actually i don't know if

694
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,760
the inference uh

695
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,919
infrastructures built tensorflow and

696
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,600
everything that is built across here

697
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
even consider such scenarios so probably

698
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,320
they don't really have a way of you know

699
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,520
dedicating that you know only 0.001

700
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,039
percent to each inference

701
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,440
and otherwise kill it but they will have

702
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
to think about that eventually

703
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,279
so there's a lot of definitely it's a

704
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,559
new paradigm and there are a lot of

705
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
security vectors too

706
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
unless you're google right

707
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
some models you know maybe the newer

708
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,039
models were more limited to the specific

709
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,919
teams that have

710
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,840
the highest competition only but in

711
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,360
general there were there were

712
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
several generations of tpus available

713
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,799
and you choose

714
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,760
or to run on normal cpu tpu sometimes

715
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
you just say whatever is available

716
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,559
and yeah from that point of view

717
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,400
google is quite amazing cool man

718
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,679
so that is what you've been working on

719
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
bro like i mean i'm guessing you're not

720
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
into the ai stuff

721
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,120
whatever you've been working on man um

722
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
in the context of machine learning

723
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
that's pretty fun that you know that

724
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,799
some frameworks

725
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,120
like open source frameworks for model

726
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,559
training and processing

727
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,039
uh like akumos they have the

728
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,559
multi-distributed multiple

729
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,480
components inside for operations of the

730
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
model for training the model

731
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
for uh i don't know i'm not an expert i

732
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,760
just look at this

733
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,559
as a pentester and a lot of things a lot

734
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,240
of toys inside this uh this big

735
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
environment and sometimes if your model

736
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
is successful you need to touch some end

737
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,720
point

738
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
uh to make some decisions like the model

739
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,080
decide that is a cats

740
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,400
please touch this endpoint so and

741
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
sometimes you can identify

742
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,679
vulnerabilities in these

743
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
systems like a server-side request

744
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
forgery for example

745
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,520
and you can touch without any trainings

746
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,159
without

747
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,600
any processing you don't need to

748
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,679
understand what happens in the model

749
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,440
you just need to touch this this end

750
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
point by yourself and

751
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,440
your attack will be successful so that's

752
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,679
where where application security starts

753
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,559
i think adversarial attacks ends when

754
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,240
when application security starts and

755
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,039
sometimes

756
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,360
um you don't need to be to be the expert

757
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,640
in machine learning you don't need to

758
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
waste your time as attacker to train the

759
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,720
model to bypass the model to bypass the

760
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,440
filter

761
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
but you just need to find one accessory

762
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
and that's it so that's why

763
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
i'm going to talking about i'm going to

764
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,760
talk about application security

765
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,039
and during doing some uh

766
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,600
research stem tests external contests uh

767
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
maybe like personal research including

768
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
machine learning stuff

769
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,400
uh we think that uh the standard

770
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
mistakes happens

771
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,159
ten years the same not the same

772
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,039
vulnerabilities

773
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,880
different code different languages

774
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,080
different uh

775
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
you know frameworks different skill set

776
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
of developers but the same

777
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
mistakes if you uh look at top 10 of us

778
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,760
top 10

779
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
uh something changed not sure just maybe

780
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
names of the vulnerabilities names

781
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,320
titles but techniques of exploitation

782
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,679
techniques of

783
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
uh finding the same and uh i think the

784
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,520
one

785
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
main bug here in application security is

786
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,720
in human dna

787
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
yes we need to fix the human dna

788
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,559
and that's why that's why i think uh

789
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,360
leading

790
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,279
independent organizations like ova's

791
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,960
open web application security project

792
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,760
they decide

793
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,320
not only to share with the people some

794
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,400
methodologies some tools but

795
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
also some programs like uh security

796
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,400
championship programs

797
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
and uh it means that they try to fix not

798
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,880
only the process of sdlc

799
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
yes not only weaknesses in the process

800
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,200
of software development life cycle but

801
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
a human factor in this life cycle means

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
that you need to prepare not a security

803
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,200
dedicated expert

804
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
in your team uh you need to prepare a

805
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
security expert in each developer of

806
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,360
your organization

807
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,399
and during during uh during

808
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
some some of the carriers i think uh we

809
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
have some experience to deploy this

810
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
program to implement the program

811
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,480
to understand the pain points is it uh

812
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,640
how to teach your developer to deal with

813
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
security ninja

814
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
just not to use uh dots or etc but how

815
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,880
to fix the code

816
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,840
so because you know uh if you fix the

817
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
vulnerability and the latest stage of

818
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,799
release it means

819
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,960
you will spend more money you need to

820
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,559
move to the left you need to fix the

821
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,240
vulnerability from the code

822
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,159
and only one solution that help you to

823
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,600
do that it's uh

824
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,679
it's the people who press produce the

825
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,960
code yes

826
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
of course you can organize the bug

827
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,720
bouncy program you can organize

828
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
the penetration testing crowdsourcing

829
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
for this problem but

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,399
it will be it will be just a fixing of

831
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
symptoms a lot of root cause

832
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,120
stuff uh that's that's uh i'm going to

833
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,399
talking about

834
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,520
well i mean when you talk about

835
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,279
application security i think a lot of

836
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,200
times the developer mistakes right uh

837
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,399
simply because they're cutting and

838
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,520
pasting from

839
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,720
you know stack overflow right so good

840
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,399
examples are given that i already have

841
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,120
bugs in them

842
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,559
and then you know they're just reusing

843
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,399
that or it's libraries and that's also

844
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,000
another issue right like i mean

845
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,840
a lot of times we just leverage whatever

846
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
framework library especially python

847
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
right now you just whatever

848
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
include the library that's import based

849
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
import days import everything

850
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,399
stack extract yeah that stuff has

851
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
vulnerabilities and then you know you

852
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,720
can't really

853
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
you don't really think about it because

854
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,159
you kind of pasted it

855
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,440
now your entire app is good

856
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
yes correct and authentication of the

857
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,399
developer it's a little bit different

858
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,080
process the dedication of hacker for

859
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,799
example

860
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,520
if you see some some trying to try to

861
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,000
educate

862
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,559
yourself you will see some deep

863
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,000
technical programs that

864
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,760
requires you to learn tools

865
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
for for attackers yet that some

866
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
something that's trivial but developers

867
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,559
it's a little bit different mindset

868
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,640
so for developers security is like one

869
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
feature yeah

870
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
you don't need to open your burp suit

871
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,679
every time when you produce the code

872
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,679
because your developer you waste the

873
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,799
money of company

874
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,799
that's why you need just to understand

875
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,159
is your code

876
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,520
correct or not is it earlier so it's a

877
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,200
different approach for for the training

878
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
programs for developers

879
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,760
and i think uh championship it's it

880
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,520
means that we don't need to prepare

881
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
security experts

882
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
but we need to prepare development

883
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
experts in security

884
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,520
stuff sounds fascinating

885
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,480
um unfortunately i think that's all the

886
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,279
time we have

887
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,200
