so what about you corey hey hi i'm corey

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
and i have more than six years of

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
experience in the cyber security

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
and i focus on the cybersecurity

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,319
business science and the vocabulary

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
research

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
and in the past few years i'm called

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,959
more than

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
20 cv in open source also i have some

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,680
certificate

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
like the ocp or gxpn

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,440
and that i think i'm a innovator or

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
creator

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
in the research team okay so

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
um our lab the panasonic security that

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,440
uh was found in the uh 2018 in taipei

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,480
city

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
so our our targets and our goal

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
will be the focus on iot product

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
research

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
for the security so like you see

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
we provide the training and penetration

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,680
testing

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
and iot security research so

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
here is the online that we will show

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
today is the word i was talking

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,640
about uh some background why we

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,879
did why we uh what we download panasonic

94
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,599
as you know that is a very

95
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
uh big company and enterprise in the uh

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
our global world we provide many

97
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,400
products so

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
here is the four pieces of the business

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
like you know we provide air

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,519
conditioning

101
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,560
and cooking and housekeeping and

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
i think all of you must know that we

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,959
also have a very famous iot uh the

104
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,400
products not iot

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
but uh it's very probably a little bit

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,000
expensive

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
uh we call it a hair driver right so

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
uh and the next will be the uh

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
housing so

110
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
the automatic about provide a product

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
for the car

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
and even like uh b2b solutions

113
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,680
so we also provided any ammunitions

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
for the uh the monitor in the airplanes

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
so and the last one that we have is

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
devices business so based on that

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,440
we have uh more than thousands of

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
products and turned into the iot

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
solutions since the couple years that

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,639
goes

121
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
so here let's see the trend of the iot

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
uh internet of things that we called iot

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,199
since

124
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,479
2015 to the 2025 year has

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
more than five times increase

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,240
the the numbers are increased so this

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
the other hands that is to have the uh

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,479
where we have the very critical

129
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,520
security issues on our devices like we

130
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,720
noticed that

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
um about a couple years ago there is a

132
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
very famous

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
malware called mirais and half so

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
also we facing a lot of the iot

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
security incident so

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,800
in panasonic separate attacks are

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,320
considered

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
a major corporal raised risk at the

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
panasonic

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
and we need to preventing the cyber

141
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
attack to protect the

142
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,919
company assess in

143
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,080
critical so this image shows the basic

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
framework for the risk management is

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
publicly

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,120
shown on the panasonic corporate website

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,600
so

148
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
means this is a promise to all of our

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,360
customers

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
we aimed to the subway attack as our

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
main policy and our goal for our whole

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,880
enterprise so um so how do we protect

153
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
the panasonic flanders type of attack

154
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
so we have the three head heaters to

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
have that being as

156
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
established and the first one on the

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
left is focused on iot security we call

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,120
the scissors

159
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,199
and the middle one is the product

160
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,280
security for the pieces

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
and also in your right hands the last

162
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
one where you focused on manufacturing

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
those three pillows for the

164
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
cyber security activity in panasonic

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
so focus for

166
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
focus on the product security of

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
activity for the product security as

168
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,199
opposed to the panasonic brands

169
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,360
so we have the initial technology

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
we provide a product security training

171
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
for the uh

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,960
best for the developers even like for

173
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
the normal

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
employees we need to increase in the

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
air when awareness and technical

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,039
technical things for the whole

177
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,160
people work in the panasonic so

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,199
the other hand is the minimizer risk and

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,800
the incident response

180
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
to support the product security in

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,440
panasonic

182
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
the first one will be the library

183
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
tennessee's minimizer race we have the

184
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
many standards and procedures that we

185
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
need to follow before this

186
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
product is shipping so we do

187
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
the threat analysis before we are

188
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,840
planning to prepare to make inner

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
products and we do

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
the security design and the security

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
secure coding even we do the security

192
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,680
testing

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
for the uh more exact

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
multimeter like penetration testing so

195
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,759
after shipping we will focus on incident

196
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,039
response that is

197
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,560
the uh what our pieces do

198
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
so back to the topic

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,160
today we were gonna focus on the

200
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
incident response that

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,599
is we face in the many challenges after

202
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:30,560
shipping

203
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
we now we have the uh on our pc websites

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
we provide a phone

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
to make the research search

206
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
for the researchers or attackers or

207
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,958
whatever

208
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,959
who found the vulnerability in our

209
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,080
products you can

210
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
report the vulnerability to us

211
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
so but we're still facing a many

212
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
challenge after the ship

213
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,440
so our products iot products still been

214
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,080
attacked

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
after shipping and which cost a lot of

216
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,360
the money to

217
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
to and to perform a penetration testing

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
or even like a security testing and

219
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
most important thing is that the testing

220
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
results still cannot be

221
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,080
covered the 100 percent security issues

222
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
in that is the uh legendary

223
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
for our internals so

224
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,000
in the external size we as we know

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the iot product include the naming

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,040
service

227
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
so too much service they include the iot

228
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,080
product

229
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
and we need to follow the government

230
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
required request

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
and then consumer asking for that

232
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
security issues

233
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,880
so that's why we think it's better to

234
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
to provide a kind of the bounty programs

235
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
in our enterprise and

236
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
our company so

237
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
here is the kimena project jimmy project

238
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
you can imagine that that is the

239
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
trail version of the papanti programs

240
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
for the panasonic

241
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
and we have the three turns

242
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,760
for the uh these plane phones the first

243
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
steps for the short terms we make the

244
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,720
key mirror

245
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
so the kimera platform is enabled to

246
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,760
kind of place a virus virus home

247
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
appliance into the very spatial box

248
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
so the hacker are provided with a very

249
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,959
special mechanic

250
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
to operate onto the available eyes

251
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
so let's move to the middle

252
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,959
stage which means in this year's we turn

253
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
our camera to be a very more special one

254
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,959
so curry will introduce a little bit

255
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,320
more details

256
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,760
for us later and our long term

257
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
is we need to we hope we can

258
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,480
uh provide a product panasonic

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,560
bounty program to and to the

260
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,680
to the globals so here is some goals we

261
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
need to and we hope find more

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
unknowns the vulnerability and make a

263
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
strong relationship with the outsides

264
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
or not just for the research but more

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,680
than

266
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,519
like hackers so enhance our brand values

267
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
and most important things is that we

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
need to make

269
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
our products more secure so uh

270
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,800
next our pass to the corey he will

271
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
introduce some uh

272
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
our similar details and

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,240
our next step for the uh ximena 2021

274
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
okay thank you sean okay i'm going to

275
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
start with the camera

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
in 2020 and then talk about

277
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
our remote camera for the 2021

278
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,760
well you know panasonic is a traditional

279
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
company

280
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
and they don't want to spoil the

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
weakness of their product

282
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
so last year we decided we call the

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
camera box

284
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
and then put some iot ball into this box

285
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
so you can see it in the slide such as a

286
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,639
washing machine

287
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
or air conditioning or refrigerator

288
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,360
and dq might differ then we show it on

289
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,720
the comprehensive boots

290
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,120
and then we let people to edit our

291
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
chimera box

292
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
it could be part of our company

293
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,760
reputation and

294
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
one more important thing is no one to

295
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,839
know what kind of the product on this

296
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,000
box

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
so and in the first eight months

298
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
we focus on the design this box and the

299
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,399
embedded iot board and the test network

300
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,200
environment

301
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
and the 3d printer our camera so

302
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,000
everybody can see here it's like

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
the machine lion and the next five month

304
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,200
we held the three camera events

305
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,839
then the first event as well

306
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
was held in our lab and the total of the

307
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
10 students are participate

308
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
and we designed the two mode the first

309
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
one is the one hour the world game

310
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,519
again and the second one is to simulate

311
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
the bounty contest

312
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
and then another two even we are more

313
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
than 100 people participating

314
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
and we can we have decided to challenge

315
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,959
more

316
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,079
and the first one is hardware mode and

317
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:22,880
then

318
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
they can use some serial port to connect

319
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,160
to our

320
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,200
camera box and then the other one is a

321
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
network mode

322
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
and they can using the wireless connect

323
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
or iot port so

324
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
you can see here

325
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,320
and actually we found some interesting

326
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
from the straight times

327
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,920
even most of the ethical values the

328
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
similar procedure for testing

329
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
our camera box such as excessive

330
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,000
injection

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
or fuzzy some a special char or those

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,399
are pillow

333
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,560
but we're guessing they might have

334
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
really some testing guideline or

335
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,279
so our iot pro has a lightweight service

336
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,160
well you know actually we get her some

337
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,720
very good

338
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
feedback from the participant so which

339
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,399
will become

340
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,040
a problem that mirror need to solve

341
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
then all cameras in the

342
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
constant and legible value to the pen

343
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,480
song

344
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
last year but we still

345
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
like the summons pro unknown which is

346
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,920
very not important but not

347
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
not a noun so this is this so this is

348
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:37,680
why

349
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
we need to do a remote chimera called

350
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,399
this field

351
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,160
and then so i will talk about our

352
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
new camera in 2021 and

353
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
the remote camera will be like the 48

354
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,600
hour auntie

355
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480

356
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,120
besides

357
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,240
money only the trust and

358
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
the more smart device like a smart tv

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
a webcam or photocopier however some uh

360

find any information about it

384
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
so if there are international hackers

385
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,000
who want to

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
join this program uh how do they do it i

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
mean is there a website that they can go

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,399
to

389
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,600
or it's not public yet or

390
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,000

399
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,440

414
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
sorry that the dates uh for hitcon this

415
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
this year

416
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
uh the keycon will be slow down the uh

417
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,039
in august

418
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
to uh 27 to the uh

419
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
28th in this year but it will depend on

420
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
the pandemic because

421
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,679
taiwan is not really good

422
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
in those weeks everywhere

423
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
everywhere is screwed up man like even

424
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
uh our singapore conference is supposed

425
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
to be

426
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
27 28 of august also but uh

427
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,280
it doesn't look like the situation is

428
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,080
going to allow

429
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
for physical conference um which is why

430
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
i asked whether you know

431
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
uh we can join via remote because uh

432
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,000
maybe

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
all of the guys watching at home i'm

434
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,120
sure a lot of them would love to to

435
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,640
participate in the crime era program

436
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,120
because

437
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,559
it's super interesting right you

438
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
actually have access to

439
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
uh home appliances that number one you

440
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,679
don't have to buy but number two

441
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,240
it's like a controlled environment and

442
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,919
the bugs will get fixed

443
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,760
which is um good so yeah having a remote

444
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
access to the to the contest is cool

445
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,960
very cool oh yeah but

446
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
uh we are very lucky is because uh in

447
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
last

448
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,039
years uh taiwan doesn't by affect by the

449
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
kobe 19 very

450
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
seriously so we make the physical

451
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,240
conference

452
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
and we join the conference physically so

453
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,679
um i hope we hope we can join the um

454
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,600
hold the same things in this year as

455
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
well so

456
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,559
it depends on the copy 19. so for the

457
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,000
competition this year are you guys going

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
to add more targets or

459
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
are you just refining the the

460
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
infrastructure

461
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
yeah in this year we will provide a more

462
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
than like uh

463
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,480
15 16 devices and

products in these years

466
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,280
so in last year's we only provided four

467
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,480
kinds of

468
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000

money yeah

479
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
uh how about giving out the hardware

480
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200

497
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,840
been working on for the rest of this

498
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,320
year

499
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,360
uh in this year we would keep to do our

500
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,159
iot

501

security research but it's not done yet

502
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
so we will do this

503
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
in the end of the year so maybe

504
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320

505
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,960
