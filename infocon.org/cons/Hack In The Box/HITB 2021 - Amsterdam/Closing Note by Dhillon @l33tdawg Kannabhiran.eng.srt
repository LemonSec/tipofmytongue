had a bit of technical snafus but hey

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,759
it wouldn't be a hitv conference if we

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,960
didn't have some technical problems

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,680

planning stuff for

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
later in the year we definitely need to

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,840
do some ctf stuff

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
uh also to my time for uh doing

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
all of his concept track introductions

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,399
uh and

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,479
of course to the volunteers who recorded

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
a little bit of their intros for the

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
speakers as well so

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
hopefully you know it's not the same as

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,959
doing it in person but

67
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,239
at least you guys did a little bit of a

68
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,080
role so that was kind of fun

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
um materials so most of the speakers

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
uh i forgot my fault to remind them to

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,560
send me their slides

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
so guys please send me your slides uh

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,519
email it to me i think cooper has

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,160
already been

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,879
uh facing some of you guys so for those

76
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
of you who have already sent it to us

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
i've already uploaded it so you can

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,840
download the slides at the materials

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
repository

80
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
and then the videos so cooper

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
has once again done a phenomenal job

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
and i think all the videos are actually

83
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
ready to go because they've already been

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
uploaded into our youtube channel but

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
um we probably need to do a little bit

86
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
of post-production for the studio track

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
and for all of the interviews that we

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,239
did over the last two days

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
uh so i expect that we'll i know maybe

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,319
release the videos in about a week or

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
or two weeks uh and of course just

92
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
follow us on twitter and you know

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,959
you get all of those notifications there

94
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,760
all right

95
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,280
so singapore

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
now uh when well we were planning to do

97
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
uh a hybrid event right so something

98
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,720
that would be uh

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
in person uh as well as online but um

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as you guys know from the news uh

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
singapore is back on lockdown now

102
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
malaysia is also back on lockdown

103
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,640
and it's 28th of may

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
oh you can't just schedule for the 26th

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
and 27th of august

106
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,720
uh that gives us two months to to plan

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,959
everything for an on-site event uh

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
you need at least three so it basically

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
it's not enough time

110
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,959
uh plus the hotel is also saying that uh

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
it doesn't look likely that the

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,599
government is going to allow

113
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,640
gatherings of uh of a certain size right

114
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
like and like a conference would

115
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
probably be about at least 100 people

116
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,239
um so virtual conference bros

117
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
uh but in anyhow we at least have this

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
studio thing so

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,959
i think it worked quite well i mean

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,480
apart from the slide technical problems

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
but other than that i think it was quite

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
fun i had a good time

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
uh it was nice to chat with people even

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,799
though it's not the same as having a

125
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,478
face-to-face discussion but

126
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
you know next best approximation um so

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,798
if nothing else the singapore conference

128
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,400
will be fully virtual all the trainings

129
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
are already online so

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
i think richard johnson is doing a class

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
it's already started to sell

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
so if you guys want to go for reiter's

133
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
class which i strongly recommend because

134
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,199
it's

135
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
top-notch stuff uh sign up it's going to

136
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
be virtual so

137
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
i think it's also doing a course in june

138
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,720
of july

139
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
in the u.s time zone so you know for the

140
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
folks that are complaining that

141
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
if we can't join singapore because the

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
time zone doesn't work

143
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,919
uh you know you guys guys can join his

144
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,520
other earlier class

145
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
uh so your trainings are up go ahead and

146
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
register for that

147
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
we will probably do a ctf because we

148
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
were planning to do one anyway

149
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,479
it'll be a virtual ctf um but

150
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,160
i guess we have to see you know because

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
like i mentioned at the start right that

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
organizing an online ctf

153
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,120
is just the same amount of work as

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,960
organizing an offline cpf

155
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,400
just less infrastructure that we need to

156
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
pull but the amount of work planning and

157
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,039
you know

158
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,680
coding needed to get all the challenges

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,919
done and stuff is significant

160
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,039
uh so i will shoot the droscope man and

161
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,400
see what we can come up with

162
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
or we'll think our bros from hackerdom

163
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
because hakadom is always around to

164
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
to you know cook up some cool ctf

165
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,479
challenges

166
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
uh or maybe we'll do something with the

167
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
standoff guys right so

168
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
let's see that's it we still have at

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
least a couple of days

170
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,600
to plan something for a virtual ctf so i

171
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,120
expect that we will have something at

172
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
least for you guys to play

173
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
even if we are just stopped at home

174
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,919
still

175
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
and then it's november

176
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
and uh the last event in our calendar is

177
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,560
cyborg

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
now uh the situation in uae thank god

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
it's still

180
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,639
pretty stable uh they vaccinated like 60

181
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,720
70 of their population already so

182
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
most of the like activities business

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
activities are starting to resume in

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,280
fact in-person conferences

185
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,319
are kind of like normal

186
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,000
again um so we are quite hopeful

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
that we will be able to do an in-person

188
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
cyber week um

189
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
in november the dates are 21st through

190
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,520
the 25th

191
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,080
uh but it'll be a hybrid event so don't

192
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
worry about it i mean like you know

193
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
maybe some of you guys won't be able to

194
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
travel uh but we will still be doing a

195
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
live stream

196
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
and be a ctf as well now for the

197
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
in person conference itself uh we will

198
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
not be doing a 5000 6000

199
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
attendee event like we did in 2019 uh

200
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
it's just not possible

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
with all the social distancing and stuff

202
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
um so we have decided to

203
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
to pretty much do a much smaller event

204
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
but we're going to be focusing on sea

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,199
level so

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
uh there'll be a business track an

207
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
in-person business track

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
uh which would allow us to do some kind

209
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
of face-to-face meetings and

210
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
uh we'll use our studio that will be

211
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
actually the center focus of the

212
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
exhibition area

213
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
so that should be quite interesting and

214
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
then of course we will have a technical

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,080
track right so we'll open cfp

216
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,240
um and then for the speakers that can't

217
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
make it over well

218
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
you'll be able to present remotely and

219
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,199
for those that are

220
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,639
able to as in you've been fully

221
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
vaccinated and there's a travel bubble

222
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,280
or you know

223
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,520
you're able to come over to the uae that

224
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,800
will host you in person

225
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
and so we'll have a business track

226
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
that's going to be running we'll have a

227
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
usual technical track we'll also have a

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
complex track

229
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,720
and we'll have a ctf that's for sure

230
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
because uh

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
we missed out having a ctf last year for

232
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
cyber week and

233
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
a lot of the students that played cyber

234
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
battle the emirates

235
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
they were like man we got nothing to do

236
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,919
bro uh

237
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,240
so yeah so you know in order to give

238
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,120
those guys something

239
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
um we will plan for uh a hybridized ctf

240
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,520
that is focused for professionals so the

241
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
big pro level ctf that we did in 2019

242
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
we'll still do that again

243
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
uh but we'll merge it with cyber battle

244
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,319
to emirate so we'll have a category for

245
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,199
students

246
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
uh we're still working out like you know

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
exactly what this is going to mean and

248
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
then how do we put the edu students

249
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,919
together with the pro

250
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
and then make it a fair game but we do

251
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
have singapore right so there's august

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
where we can probably use

253
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,960
that online ctf uh as a

254
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
maybe as a like a pre qualification or

255
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,080
some sort right

256
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,479
as a testing thing um but like i said

257
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,599
early days so

258
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
stay tuned we'll be in touch and we'll

259
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
let you guys know what's being planned

260
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,319
for

261
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
november and of course for singapore

262
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,320
i guess that's pretty much it from me

263
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,958

264
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,240

266
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,599

267
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,560

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,839
uh stimulating doing some software the

272
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,959
observation stuff

273
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120

274
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
so enjoy the rest of the conference uh i

275

mix for you guys in probably about 20

277
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
