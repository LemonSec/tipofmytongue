for some secured open source

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,759
project very interesting with the name

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,200
is aurus

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,119

in my you know in my github or my social

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
medias

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
it's a open source project right so i'm

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:29,439
an

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
advocate of this awesome project it's

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
not a crime

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
because you know when you see some you

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
know

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,840
magazines or news on tv for example

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
sometimes the explanations about the

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
hacking it's related to

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
a bad guy but you know hacking is not a

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,720
crime

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
or hacking it's a mindset it's a future

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
it's a lifestyle you know because it's a

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,240
creative mind

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
so that's our idea in this awesome

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
project right so

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
i am a part of the staff team of the

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,560

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
guy i'm talking from brazil now

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
right so i am a security research and

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,239
instructor of the hacker

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,639
security hacker security is responsible

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,920
to provide some

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
portuguese training actually and uh in

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
ireland one of this is structure right

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
and i am a writer and reviewer of this

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
hockey nine in a forensic magazine so

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,319
right

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
so this is a few informations about me

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
so let's see

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
our agenda let's we during this day we

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
we're gonna talk about the what is

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
threat change your mind

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
my responsible disclosure about the

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
credit strike because this

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
tests uh happened on uh

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,080
crowd strike right so i will explain

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
more about actions

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,560
about the two about the api

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
manipulations

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
some invokes that i am using in

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,319
infections process right so

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
in the end of this presentations i'm

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,959
hoping to answer your questions

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,480
uh right so first of all my idea is to

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,519
explain

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
a few explanations about body spread

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,599
because

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,000
probably you know about that but about

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
this actually

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
but let's suppose if you don't know

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
what is a threat so this is a simple

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
explanation so according to this isil

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
is uh threat is defying it as a

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
potential cause because

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
you need to understand that this

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
potential cause

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
can be you know to improve not improve

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,799
but

95
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,560
to generate a potential incident in your

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,120
system

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
or in your organization but what does

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
that mean philip in this case

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
maybe it's a software attacks or maybe a

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,159
death

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,920
of the intellectual property because if

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
you have this intellectual property

103
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
and someone you know would like to uh

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
stall of you it's a theft and identity

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,280
path

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
so if you produce something like that or

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
sabotage for example

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
or those informations or information

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
distortion are example

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
of the information's secured threads

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
right so you need to look of this

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,319
because

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,239
if you produce some software for example

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,599
you need to

115
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
generate a project or product and baby

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
all those things is related a threat

117
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
right it's not my explanation it's

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,960
explanation related to this eyes perfect

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,680
so why i'm explaining this because in

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
the end of this presentation

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,680
it will be clear about my tasks but you

122
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
need to understand all those

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
steps about the research right so i

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
create this kind of flow

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
the first of all we have a thread and

126
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
after that when you have a thread you

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,639
need to

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
see if this thread is no or

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
unknown because you need to receive we

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,800
need to

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,880
to study about the knowledge you need to

132
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
receive this kind of knowledgement

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
because if when you understand more

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,560
about this

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
you can see you can be you know creative

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
and you can discovery more about

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
the unknown threats right so

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
when you are you know studying or an

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,440
ally or

140
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,880
as a quitting semi-analyzing uh in fact

141
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
uh in seven threads for example after

142
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
this analysis you can produce

143
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
some report right so after that you can

144
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,320
improve your defenses mechanism

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
like this security sensor that you have

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,440
in your

147
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
organization or your company sometimes

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,199
you can improve this kind of cyber

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
threat intelligence awesome board right

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
it's important for for the month

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
subreddit intelligence you know to build

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
it it's

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,560
i know that is is difficult to to build

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
it in

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
in many different compass companies

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,039
because you need to have

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
different guys with different different

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,560
knowledgement

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,199
but the idea in the end of the day is to

160
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,400
build it you know to

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
to improve this kind of business

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
unit let's let's say that right and

163
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,039
after that you can

164
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
uh it's training your cyber resilience

165
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,120
because

166
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
all the time the threats are

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
changing right so okay so let me

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
invite you to change your mind today

169
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
because first of all you understand what

170
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
is cyber threatening hunting

171
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
i think it's very clear but my idea here

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
is to explain more about this kind of

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
mindset right so when you talk about the

174
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,039
hunting

175
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,840
and of course you can have this kind of

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,160
a

177
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
guy or you know professional

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
inside of some team or support team or

179
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,479
maybe a

180
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,479
you know uh cyber threat intelligent

181
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,840
team but

182
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
the idea of this action is related to a

183
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,199
proactive

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,080
approach to the cyber defense but with

185
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
the offensive mind

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
it means the process of proactively and

187
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
interactively

188
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
searching right so through the networks

189
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,520
to detect

190
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
first of all you need to detect and

191
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
after that you need to isolate this kind

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,199
of

193
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
advanced threat this is a good point

194
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
here you need to

195
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
detect and isolate but take a look this

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,120
offensive mind it's my invite this is my

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,840
idea

198
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,120
to invite you right so what is a trendy

199
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
hunter it's a person

200
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
right it's a professional uh responsible

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,319
to

202
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,280
recognize isolate and disable a

203
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
potential apt is advanced

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
persistent threat usually some

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,160
techniques in manual manual techniques

206
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,479
like

207
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,120
you know you can use a good different uh

208
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
analyzers like you know more analysis

209
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,520
using

210
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,400
for example a statistic analysis let's

211
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,880
say

212
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
that and uh or using uh um

213
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,800
at first intelligence right so based on

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
some techniques or

215
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,039
related and something like that right so

216
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,520
uh

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,639
this professional and risk cancer ship

218
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
are possible internals take a look at

219
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,840
this internals are external intruders

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
that is the key because in the past when

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
we

222
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
look at uh to the threats

223
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,599
usually we look at to the outside the

224
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
company the external intruder

225
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,560
but now in this moment not exactly in

226
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,680
this morning

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,720
moment today but in nowhere days

228
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,360
actually

229
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
we have a many possible internal

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,879
intruders

231
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
right because you know we have a

232
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
person that i that been have been

233
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
studying about your company

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
and how your company works or how this

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,639
social media is about your company works

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,199
to try

237
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,919
looking some uh different strategies to

238
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,399
try

239
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,958
exploring your environment or your

240
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
network or your company

241
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,559
and so on and so on right so let's

242
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,360
talk about the 3d hunting based on a

243
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
ioc's

244
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
uh it's indicator of compromise but in

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,640
this case we have some

246
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
indicators to include of this iocc and

247
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
that's my point that's my point here

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,519
because

249
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,640
when you talk about the iocs

250
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
usually not usually but when you have

251
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,399
the ioc

252
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,360
you need to receive an attack with this

253
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
attack already happened

254
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
right because after that you can analyze

255
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
and you can check and you can have the

256
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,320
domain

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
an ip address or you know a cited

258
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
website related some phishing or some

259
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,760
website related as somehow delivered uh

260
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
its means

261
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
after the attack right so let's see some

262
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,880
indicators

263
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
that we have some suspensions on the

264
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
road hostile domain or

265
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
ips or maybe mdc or hashes or part of

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
the cryptograph

267
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,560
file or some signatures detector

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
suspension

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
or suspect uh or another files

270
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,000
or maybe some ideas signatures or

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,120
antivirus

272
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
let's say this kind of way or some data

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
related to a potential explanation or

274
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
maybe

275
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
if you remember about the wannacry it's

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,640
related on microsoft vulnerability right

277
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
do you remember about the smb

278
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
protocol to share some information so

279
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,000
this

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
is related and that vulnerability

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
right and another point related to ioc

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,760
is based on techniques techniques and

283
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,800
procedures it's

284
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
the famous ttp is right associated with

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,240
the suspensions

286
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
or known austere events or data or maybe

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
some tools that are being used for

288
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
example like a mini cat or another

289
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
you know unix platform maybe you can

290
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
using when you realize or perform and

291
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,240
penetration

292
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
tests right so this is my point in this

293
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
point here is related to iocs

294
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,000
right so if you see some informations

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
about the ioc

296
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
today we have this kind of awesome

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,880
project malware information sharing

298
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,760
platform

299
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
now like miss p right so misbeats a

300
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
threat sharing platform it's a free and

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,920
open source

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
software open information to sharing of

303
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
the threat intelligence including

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,360
cyber security indicators it's very

305
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
interesting because you can see

306
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
here in this picture many different

307
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,000
um events related to some hours

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,640
so you can produce some intelligence

309
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
thing

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
like on these different attacks

311
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,279
right so let's talk about another

312
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,000
technique

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
this technique is named aoa it's

314
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,079
indicator of

315
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,560
what of attack but in this case the

316
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,680
focus here is

317
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,600
the focus here is on why

318
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,320
an attacker intention right so you need

319
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
to answer these questions

320
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
why the attacker are doing that right so

321
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
it's a more

322
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
strategic view of the ttps

323
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
and again the famous technique that's

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,440
his techniques and procedures

325
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
many times related on of course and apts

326
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,600
because

327
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
if you have this kind of scientific

328
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
techniques and procedures

329
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
of course we need to have this more

330
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,240
knowledgement to be

331
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,480
execute this kind of attack right so

332
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
when properly

333
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,639
positioning a more mature intelligence

334
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,000
program has animation

335
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,519
so this is totally related on

336
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,519
behavior and let's see what the

337
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
difference between your a and your iocs

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
io season ioa it's the good point here

339
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,720
is

340
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,279
when you talk about the iocs the

341
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,920
attacker

342
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
already happened but when you

343
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,680
looking in works with the relating and

344
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
so

345
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
eo way is related to something it's

346
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,200
not a happen yet right so

347
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
you need to see some indicators or in uh

348
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,959
that you can see things that didn't

349
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,680
happen

350
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
yet but could be um

351
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
a new attack or attack right so let's

352
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,120
see it's a real-time behavior including

353
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
but not limited or 20 point behavior

354
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,959
analysis

355
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
right because probably you have this

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,720
kind of you know

357
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
settings in your antivirus but let's

358
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,480
let's suppose for example if you have

359
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
the um

360
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,279
some pssx running in your environment

361
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
but at noon

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
and you don't have this any uh tasks to

363
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,959
do in

364
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,519
this kind of time right so maybe it's a

365
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,720
suspicious

366
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,000
behavior because because who could be

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
execute this past exact in your

368
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
environment do you know

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
what is pessa zack it's a a tool from

370
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,360
microsoft

371
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
responsible responsible to execute some

372
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,600
remote scripts

373
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
right so let's suppose if you see some

374
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
uh events

375
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
at knowing your company and you don't

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,199
have any

377
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
people excluding this kind of task it's

378
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
suspicious right and another point it's

379
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
called execution method that or like at

380
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
some dll

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,279
call it related at some sequences events

382
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,639
or some testings

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
that are taking right so user behavior

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
in the relationship to the digital

385
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
threads

386
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
some behavior like you know some uh

387
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,519
users clicking

388
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,399
in in some uh websites or maybe

389
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
ttp is against linked to a host data

390
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
such as mowers or using some attacks

391
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,040
or persistent health components using an

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,680
attack

393
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,440
it's all those informations as uh are

394
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,279
some behaviors related into a maybe

395
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,399
eoa right so let's see some

396
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
more indicators for example

397
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
internal hoses with a bad destinations

398
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
let's suppose that you have a company

399
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,199
here

400
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,320
and uh not here in brazil but

401
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,399
whatever maybe in brazil and you don't

402
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
have any business with the us and i

403
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,600
don't know

404
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
poland or maybe um you know

405
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
luxembourg for example so if you don't

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,079
have any

407
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
business with this kind of country so

408
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
why you need to be

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
uh why you need to have connections or

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
your internal hosts

411
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,199
to be a connection with this kind of

412
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
country no need it's not necessary right

413
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
so you can look at this kind of thing

414
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,440
this

415
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,480
this kind of behavior but if you have

416
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
internal hosts trying to connect with

417
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,959
bad destinations maybe is a suspicious

418
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,240
another point it's

419
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,720
internal holes with a non-standard ports

420
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,079
you can as you can see

421
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
you know for example let's see some uh

422
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
ports like a 403 or 80

423
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,440
or you know uh 53 for example

424
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
the the standard port but you have

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,360
another different port

426
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,480
using to be a smtp protocol you know

427
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,040
it's

428
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
maybe suspicious right so another point

429
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
is public server like a dmz

430
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,360
to try to connect in your internal host

431
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,399
or maybe office of our mobile detections

432
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
like

433
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
you are see some uh uh outbreak attack

434
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,480
in the uh one a.m for example

435
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
it's enough of our detection because

436
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,079
usually

437
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,800
in this time you don't have your support

438
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,639
team it's it's more short right

439
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,680
you don't have the the full team uh

440
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,199
in this kind of you know uh one a.m

441
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
of the morning right and uh not another

442
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
point is some networks

443
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
in your internal network internal host

444
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
and of course if you have for example up

445
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
in a trading penetration test team the

446
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,639
executive mistakes

447
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,959
okay but if you don't have is a

448
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,920
suspicious

449
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,000
another point is multiple alarmist

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,720
events in a single host again

451
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
on a single host with a main different

452
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,320
alarms

453
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,519
maybe the system is reinfected with them

454
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
our another behavior

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,839
so if you see here we have different

456
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,800
behaviors and you maybe you have a

457
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,279
infection or maybe not because of this

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,399
is related to

459
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,920
eoa right another point it's multiple

460
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
logins from different regions

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,079
you are one in one person right so if

462
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,280
you are in brazil

463
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
if you if you are in brazil here or if

464
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
he is in brazil

465
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
it's impossible to be at the same time

466
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
in another different countries right so

467
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
it's very simple another internal host

468
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
using

469
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
much smtp uh to try connections and

470
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,640
antenna holds

471
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,319
using many queries to stereo and

472
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,760
internal dns

473
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,959
it's here it's very very common right so

474
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
uh now my idea is to explain more about

475
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,320
my uh

476
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
poc right so this is my responsible

477
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
disclosure about the count strike

478
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,400
company because this test

479
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
is related to a crown strike right so

480
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,240
when i just

481
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
discovered this uh failure right

482
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
so i i submitted this reporting

483
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
in october 20 right and i sent some

484
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
messages if you see here it's in

485
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
portuguese because my contact

486
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,880
of this company is it his it was in

487
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,520
brazil

488
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,320
so i sent to some message to the

489
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
brazilian guys here

490
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
to explain about some tests that i am

491
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,960
doing

492
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
and hear the impact in english of course

493
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
because i was

494
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
supposed supposing that these reports

495
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
maybe will be

496
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
you know uh send to the uh research team

497
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
so i sent some informations in english

498
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,919
this is the first

499
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
test that i did right so using the zoo

500
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
uh

501
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
i undownload something right so but as

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
you can see here it's october 20th

503
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,000
right so i send and i send and i receive

504
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,480
some

505
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,360
generic answers from this vendor and

506
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,480
another day

507
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
and uh the crosstime team team and sent

508
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,480
me

509
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
not time sorry for here it's it's team

510
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,919
not a time

511
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,400
right so the simple generic answer is

512
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,919
our technical team

513
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
analyzed the points and we didn't

514
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,280
validate this

515
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,480
as a valid test for this solution so

516
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
i'm trying to send another emails i'm

517
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,160
trying to call

518
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
uh to make a call to try to talk with

519
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,520
many

520
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
people inside the cloud strike i opened

521
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
a support case

522
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,720
and in the and here the explanation

523
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
in portuguese and after the

524
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
9 and december 9th i received this last

525
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
answer from this vendor we'd like to

526
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,720
thank you for your super mission

527
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
which was being forwarded to our

528
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,400
internal team for a full review and

529
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,919
modification creation additional

530
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,600
capabilities in falcon

531
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,360
solutions right so uh should be they be

532
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,400
necessary

533
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
but here is the bad answer as you aren't

534
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,640
not currently

535
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
current customer if you an active

536
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,320
support subscription

537
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
however we cannot provide you with any

538
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,919
further information for results so and i

539
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
i should be should you and disguise into

540
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
me right have any

541
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
additional questions or concerns please

542
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
directed them

543
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,679
to your account team but if i'm not

544
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,200
customer i don't have an account team

545
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,520
right so this is the last answer that i

546
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,640
received from

547
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
the ground strike three months after

548
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,400
right so my tests okay so let's talk

549
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,679
about the our

550
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
demonstration our poc right so first of

551
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
all the idea of the purpose of this test

552
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
it was to execute

553
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,360
uh several efficient injection testings

554
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,120
not only in count strike but i did uh i

555
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,400
actually i i tried this test as in

556
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
counter-strike and so forth

557
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
and cyber reason right so of course we

558
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,080
have

559
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
bad results not bad but the

560
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
better results in other companies and

561
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,799
counter-strike it

562
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,320
was very very very bad but the idea is

563
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
this presentation oops this presentation

564
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,640
which

565
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,960
brings up the results of the defensive

566
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
security analysis with the

567
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,559
offensive mind do you remember in the

568
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,240
beginning of this presentation as i talk

569
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
about this change your mind

570
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
right to try try understand more about

571
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,200
the

572
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
offensive mind related to a defense

573
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,679
right so if you are a guy very working

574
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,440
with a defensive

575
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
defensive team you can work with

576
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,720
offensive you can have this offensive

577
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,919
mind so right

578
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
so that's my purpose here and

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
first of all the idea is to as i put

580
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,960
some reversal shell

581
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,080
right in my whitman machine and after

582
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
that i have this

583
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
reversal and i can manipulate something

584
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,799
and i'm

585
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
using this reverse shell to connect in

586
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,720
smca's

587
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
cnc or command line control to download

588
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
another powershell for fire right

589
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,360
and after that execute themself

590
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,200
and to download using mpi connection

591
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,919
from this kind of dbs power and after

592
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,240
that

593
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
to infected the environment right so

594
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,159
let's see here my

595
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
simple simple so it's very

596
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
simple as you can see i use it in python

597
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,159
right so i imported this kind of

598
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,600
libraries right so as you can see it's

599
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
very very simple and i opened the socket

600
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
here as you can see using the socket

601
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
stream

602
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,679
to connect in my attacking machine

603
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,960
and i open this 77 port to

604
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,360
receiving a reverse shell right so this

605
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,000
is the process

606
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,679
that i opened as you can see here

607
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
windows system 32

608
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,919
and cmd to open the process to

609
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,679
manipulate to open this

610
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
thread to connect and uh in my bitmap

611
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,080
machine this is the simple

612
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,120
simple code by the way if you'd like to

613
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
see more informations or more detail

614
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,919
about these tests

615
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
all those informations are in my github

616
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,760
here

617
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
in philippe h6 the

618
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,200
slash cut strike and here you can see

619
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
all those complete

620
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,200
report and complete informations about

621
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,159
this test

622
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
or in this case that i'm talking with

623
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
with you here uh here it's important

624
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
information

625
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
machine learning is using to pre

626
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
execution prevention

627
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,679
preventions falcon hosting uh employs

628
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,400
sophisticated machine learning

629
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,760
algorithms that

630
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
can analyze the millions of ios

631
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,679
characteristics to determine if

632
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,720
file is malicious right so

633
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,760
the signature-less uh technology enable

634
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
focal host to detect and block both

635
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,760
no and unknown hours and here

636
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,159
in the end of this presentation you can

637
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,880
see

638
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
this mower is totally no

639
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,279
mower so in the end of this presentation

640
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,559
we will see

641
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,279
some problem here but anyway so let's

642
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,240
return our

643
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
presentations here and let's see the

644
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,440
first

645
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,919
demo the past video so i am opening my

646
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,919
bikman machine as you can see here this

647
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,440
is my bitmain machine

648
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,880
with the ip addresses one four two

649
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,679
right so it's a thready hunting uh slash

650
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,400
a thor

651

10 poc right so this is information

654
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:08,960
about

655
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,840
my litmus machine is windows 10 as you

656
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
can see here

657
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,559
in my demo right so

658
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,720
first of all i is a good this

659
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,760
information is just

660
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,600
to show you about this microsoft windows

661
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
and pro some informations about the

662
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
settings

663
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,559
that you can see in portuguese on many

664
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,320
others informations

665
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,440
related to this system in

666
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,159
command right so let's see the director

667
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,520
here you can see

668
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,880
the shell dock pi this is a a a full

669
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
a file that i'm using that i'm sure you

670
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
um now right so i'm deleting

671
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,039
just this file because i will um

672
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,799
download after as you can see here we

673
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
don't you just have a shell

674
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,799

the

677
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,400
settings using in this uh

678
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
configurations right so uh that i did

679
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
actually i

680
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,559
applied the best practices in the

681
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,679
country strike

682
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,919
i setting some configuration as you can

683
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
see here in my

684
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,880
demo right so here um as you can see

685
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,000
this is a policy

686
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
right responsible to block

687
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
block okay this is a sensor version

688
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,360
right of this

689
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,159
solutions and i will show you some

690
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,600
information about the

691
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,240
configurations right so here as you can

692
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,799
see

693
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,360
i applied all those best practices in

694
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,799
this solution

695
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,080
right so first of all i will apply this

696
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,279
best expressions

697
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,080
to guarantee that we have the best

698
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,840
practices applied in my policy right so

699
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
as you can see here

700
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
the full using default because it's you

701
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
know it's a best practice

702
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
recommended by crowdstrike as you can

703
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,600
see

704
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,960
all those policies is enabled

705
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,600
as you can see here and i am using here

706
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,520
let me pause the video here it's very

707
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
important to see that

708
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,240
the adwords and pop-ups and clouded

709
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
phantom hours

710
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,039
all those is our configurations are in

711
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,440
uh

712
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,799
aggressive mode related to a prevention

713
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,559
in this case it's totally blocked

714
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,880
right and if you see in detection it's

715
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,679
not a block

716
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,799
but just but you have the log or it

717
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,080
should be

718
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,440
and anyway but it's extra aggressive

719
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
right so as you can see here it's

720
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,840
totally

721
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,720
totally aggressive in detection and

722
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,440
prevention

723
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
it's aggressive so in next generation

724
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,480
antivirus the same case detection it's

725
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
totally aggressive and any other it's

726
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,000
aggressive it means we have here

727
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
the more than the best practices because

728
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
they're putting in extremely

729
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
aggressive as you as i show you but of

730
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,039
course in detection because if it didn't

731
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,760
block i

732
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,520
needed to have the logs right so as you

733
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,480
can see here

734
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
many different strategy because

735
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
the crowdstrike has different engines

736
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,039
towards

737
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,080
and to try detect this kind of attacks

738
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,919
related and empower share related to um

739
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,960
as some you know uh it means

740
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
as you can i should let me pause here

741
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
and return here

742
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,399
here the detection it's related to a

743
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,600
lateral movement

744
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,799
right so here lateral movement and

745
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,000
creation access so

746
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,600
if i let's suppose if i get some access

747
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
if i got some access inside the machine

748
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
it's impossible to

749
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,480
using or to using some techniques

750
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,919
related to a

751
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,399
lateral movement right so here is a good

752
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,000
the the

753
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to see the process is as you can see

754
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
here we have the main

755
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,640
services running in my viktor machine it

756
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,520
swings

757
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
my machine it was

758
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,520
protect by count strike right so this is

759
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
the first

760
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,960
test to show all those information so

761
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,640
here as you can see we have my netcat

762
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,200
using the 77 port do you remember this

763
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
is my the port there

764
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
no standard port that i will be that i

765
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,600
am

766
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,720
using this poc right so i will execute

767
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,120
this

768
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,240
python script shelf.pi and as you can

769
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
see here

770
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,320
any information appears used for us but

771
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
when i return

772
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,640
my attacker machine take a look what

773
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,360
happened here

774
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,559
it's a simple do you remember the code

775
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,960
it's um using an open socket

776
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
right it's a it's a very common it's

777
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,360
like a you know like a script keys

778
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,600
right so but it's not attacked and so

779
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,039
what happened here

780
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,000
because i'm using the simple open socket

781
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,640
and uh

782
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
it's not a block it and it has as you

783
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
can see here i have the all those

784
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
access in my bitmap machine so

785
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,679
i can see all those informations in my

786
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,799
uh

787
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
in my folder and now take a look what i

788
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,000
am

789
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,720
i when i will do this in this moment in

790
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,120
my

791
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,720
poc i'm see in the desktop folder

792
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
i will sing the dex i'm gonna you know

793
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,240
in the

794
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,080
the desktop folder as you can see here

795
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,640
we have we don't have any

796
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,679
folder of files here so i am setting you

797
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,880
loose

798
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,000
kind of joke right so i create this fold

799
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
this file here

800
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
and if you see

801
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,159
take a look it's this simple file that

802
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:46,559
i'm

803
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,000
creating if i return in my machine

804
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
as you can see here i have this folder

805
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,960
inside my pikmin machine take a look

806
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
this

807
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
this is my folder that i am

808
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,679
created because i have now the reverse

809
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,520
shell right so the next step is

810
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,279
manipulate the api because now i have

811
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
the control of my

812
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
vicmor machine so next steps i created a

813
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,799
vbs power shell so

814
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,159
but using api because i have i had this

815
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,120
simple

816
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
this simple this is the hash simple i

817
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
downloaded this information

818
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,559
inside of this mobile bazaar platform i

819
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,559
i don't know if you know but i can share

820
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,399
after these presentations the

821
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
the link and by the way i i

822
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
i wrote the wrong here because it's

823
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,679
manipulation it's not

824
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,200
money put like platons okay so uh let's

825
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,760
see here

826
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
you need to using the api key because

827
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,840
you need to have the by the way the

828
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,039
twitter account

829
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,399
and after you realize this kind of uh

830
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,919
you know uh print this

831
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,960
fill this kind of form you have this api

832
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,519
key

833
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,880
right so i created a simple power shell

834
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,600
and as you can see here try to connect

835
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
these informations with the api

836
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,799
and i download after the after that this

837
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,600
hash

838
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,120
right using this api key and after that

839
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,000
i can use

840
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
another invoke uh process this is a

841
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,000
a true process in the windows 10 right

842
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,760
so let's see here

843
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,880
so i have the connections right but this

844
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,279
here

845
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
it's a good key because i already have

846
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
the access

847
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,640
and let's let's see i after that

848
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,840
i open by using the any grog

849
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,519
just to simulate my cnc

850
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,080
right my commanding control so i

851
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,440
activated this

852
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,640
any grog right so activating my

853
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
machine and i open this my

854
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,080
web server to connecting this any grug

855

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
walk web request right as you can see

858
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,120

to

861
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,480
have more uh to help me in this demo

862
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,039
right

863
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
and i needed the

864
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
the real name of the folder right so

865
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,640
here

866
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
i have the the powershell as i show you

867
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,039
right so with the api informations the

868
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,320
manipulations and

869
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,480
many others information so i i pass here

870
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,600
right the commanding control server

871
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,240
as you can see and i copy here the

872
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,880
folder

873
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
right so i have here my

874
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,399
web server and i have the ini grog

875
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,360
server he is

876
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,679
by the way in the united states and when

877
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,880
i did this

878
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,559
okay was in brazil okay and uh

879
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,799
here let's see the next steps so i am

880
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,519
using this

881
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,399
invoke web request sometime called the

882
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,279
power shell

883
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,000
as you can see here right and after that

884
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
i will

885
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,480
using this function invoke weber request

886
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,120
and because my idea is to using this

887
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,840
invoke request this function using the

888
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,039
powershell

889
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,720
to call my cac my commanding controller

890
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,440
this is my

891
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000
commanding controller right and here i

892
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,799
have this

893
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,120
folder malicious because it's a

894
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,080
powershell

895
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,880
malicious powershell right so after that

896
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,200
i execute this i set my

897
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,279
output file and i set the corrected path

898
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,760
as you can see here we receive a get

899
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,720
request

900
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
and i have the 2 000 uh

901
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,840
results of this request right

902
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,440
so now take a look this if i

903
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,039
see the informations what i

904
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,240
have here now i have the

905
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,240
pbs underscore kill dot

906
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,519
powershell so now take a look at this

907
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
important information i using

908
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,159
the stick my machine to connect

909
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,839
them in another

910
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,399
commanding controller in this case in

911
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,520
united states

912
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,560
right in this united states

913
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,040
i had the vbs underscore kill

914
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,199
right so all those manipulations

915
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,719
using uh you know powershell

916
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,520
python and share reverse not detected

917
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,560
by count strike right so next step using

918
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:44,800
the

919
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,199
vocus right so first of all we're using

920
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,119
web uh

921
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,879
in vocabulary requests as i show you in

922
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,159
this demo right

923
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,199
to send to to call the cnc the

924
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,399
commanding controller

925
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,599
right and after these let me

926
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,240
explain more about this powershell right

927
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,079
so you see this first part

928
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,880
right so now here we have the second

929
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,680
part

930
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
we have the invoker not this this second

931
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,839
part invoker

932
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,520
request uh dash revo reverse and method

933
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
post using a post

934
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,599
right and as you can see here i will

935
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,400
connect

936
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
in this in this directory in this

937
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
repository in more bazaar

938
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,720
and i will see some doc zip

939
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,160
folder right so i need to download all

940
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,320
of those informations in my environment

941
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,520
and after that after download these

942
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,440
informations in my viktor machine

943
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,400
i you need to open this using a 7-zip

944
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,359
right

945
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,240
uh i will set the hash file because i am

946
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,040
setting

947
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
in the in this another the hash file

948
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
here

949
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,440
the this kind of parameter right

950
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,240
because this file for this file i will

951
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,119
uh

952
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,440
i downloaded it in my victim machine

953
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
right and after that

954
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,800
i i i had a password with this folder

955
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,359
right

956
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,160
this this password is in fact that so

957
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
take a look this the commodity is

958
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,200
is including this the 7zip file to

959
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,119
extract this folder right

960
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,760
and i will set the password to open all

961
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
those informations inside of this

962
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,000
um zip file and after that i

963
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,720
will invoke another expression to

964
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,320
execute this

965
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
file means this file

966
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,800
it is inside of the zip folder right

967
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
so this zip folder has a password

968
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
so all those informations i'm using this

969
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,280
powershell script to running in my

970
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
ignore machine and after that i have

971
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,000
this bbs malicious

972
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,960
folder right so infection process uh

973
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,359
here

974
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,520
take a look this information is very

975
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,560
important

976
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,720
in the end of the smaller 172

977
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,520
lines right so in the end as you can see

978
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,480
here

979
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,560
the mainly function is create an

980
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
extension

981
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
what kind of extension top extensions

982
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,839
doc

983
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,520

it means all those um

987
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,640
extensions will be

988
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,720
right will be changed

989
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,720
to doc pbs as you can see here in this

990
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,680
code

991
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,280
right using what using ivbs it means

992
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
using that

993
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,760
debris script dock shell right it's a

994
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,800
windows processors perfect so let's see

995
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
the last demo today so

996
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,119
okay i have my

997
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,240
malicious file inside my machine

998
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,880
i will try as i could again so i will

999
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
call the powershell

1000
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,839
right in in using the powershell

1001
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,040
let's see here okay i put in the sum er

1002
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,440
here

1003
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,240
that i set a wrong parameter i will

1004
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,599
execute again with

1005
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,839
now it's a corrected comma right

1006
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,420
powershell as uh

1007
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,520
[Music]

1008
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,119
doc backslash no backslash slash and

1009
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,480
take a look at this

1010
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,680
zoop security labs and it

1011
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,800
connects to the api as you can see here

1012
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
and i extracting file achieve right

1013
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,920
it everything it's okay is

1014
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,640
is a cute in my big machine so take a

1015
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,200
look this

1016
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,560
i will set again powershell and i will

1017
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,800
see some process right so let's see

1018

it's running now take a look this

1019
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,680
debris script is running in my

1020
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,680
vichman machine again anything

1021
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,119
it was detected right so i will see

1022
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,320
in details this id right this id

it is running you know it's running take

1025
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,400
a look at this the cpu

1026
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,160
76 high cpu

1027
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,520
right so if you see more details about

1028
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,040
that

1029
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,760
this is the out the high concern of the

1030
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,640
cpu

1031
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,720
so here all those extensions right so

1032
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,119
let's return in our victim machine

1033
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
right because i have this uh reverse

1034
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,280
shell as i mentioned

1035
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
and take a look what happened here with

1036
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,359
the cpu take a look this

1037
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,599
take a look as you can see here i tried

1038
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,040
to open again

1039
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
the task manager but i didn't

1040
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
you know i tried to click here but i

1041
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,920
didn't access

1042
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
take a look this is what happened and

1043
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,280
here

1044
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,680
i don't know i i i i suppose probably

1045
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,119
you can see here

1046
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,880
we have the process of the w the table

1047
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,400
script running take a look this

1048
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,520
the high cpu the totally high cpu so

1049
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,560
let's see

1050
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,000
about the the process all the net net

1051
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,040
cat in this case

1052
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,280
what the connections different about

1053
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
nano that can net stocks

1054
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,359
about the network take a look at this

1055
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,079
how many

1056
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,480
uh connections that we have just to

1057
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,839
prove you

1058
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,240
all right so take a look at this my

1059
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,400
reversal show it's established

1060
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,160
take a look at this and of course maybe

1061
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,680
it's obviously but

1062
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,240
just to prove you that we have all

1063
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
controls of the our victim machine

1064
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,520
so let's see again take a look at this

1065
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,200
what's happening in our bitmain machine

1066
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,319
take a look at this

1067
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,079
all those extensions are changed

1068
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,319
the shell dock item the our vbs kill

1069
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
all those machines all those files it

1070
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,760
was

1071
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,440
changed our our machine it was what

1072
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,839
in fact that let's see do you remember

1073
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,040
the first

1074
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
file that i created in the beginning of

1075
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,560
this presentation's

1076
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,160
loose dock packs it was what

1077
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,440
changed it take a look this it was

1078
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
in this case it was in fact that right

1079
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,119
so

1080
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,960
this machine it was in fact that let's

1081
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,160
see the

1082
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,839
all those documents take a look this

1083
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
katie do you remember we have applied

1084
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
the the solutions

1085
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
take a look these all all the others

1086
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,240
fires inside of the

1087
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,920
machine all those files it was

1088
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,720
you know infected and changes take a

1089
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,760
look this

1090
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,720
this is internal suite that i had in

1091
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
this in my

1092
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
machine all those files totally

1093
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
infected right so

1094
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,760
but didn't detect by

1095
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
crowd strike right so i reported all

1096
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,839
this information have i

1097
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,880
show you and at the end but

1098
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,680
unfortunately we don't have any

1099
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,560
answers right so this is our machine

1100
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,520
again

1101
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,160
our whitman machine right so here i

1102
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,760
finish my presentations and

1103
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,240
