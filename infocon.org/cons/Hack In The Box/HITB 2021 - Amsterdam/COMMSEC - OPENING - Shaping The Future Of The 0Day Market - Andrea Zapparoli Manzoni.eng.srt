00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,320
hello everyone

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
and welcome to this 2021 virtual edition

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
my name is andrea i am the executive

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,519
director of crowd fence

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
and i am glad to um

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
be able to offer you the contact track

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
also uh this year also for this edition

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,399
as we

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,800
already did uh several times in the past

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,000
it will be an amazing

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
set of speeches of talks

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
so i invite you to follow them and to

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,920
really enjoy but without much to do

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,359
let me start with my little

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,040
uh little talk about what crop fence

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
does and how

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
we think we can further shape the future

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,320
zero day market

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,479
so this is the agenda uh we will see

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:18,799
what

22
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,640
is very briefly what is crop fence

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
and i will describe what is the zero day

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
market today

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
how we try to improve it and what are

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,759
the outcomes

27
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,159
of our efforts and then

28
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
what's next so

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
first of all for those that don't know

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,720
us yet

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
uh what is crowdfunds cut fence is

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
basically uae

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
we are independent we are offensive

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
security research and development hub

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
we were designed uh from scratch

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
in 2016 2017

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
uh to serve both institutional customers

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
and cyber security researchers

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,959
we tried to apply

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
the rules and the best practices and the

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
risk management

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
approaches that are normal in other

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,840
fields

44
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
of activity but not so much in the

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
development procurement

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,400
of zero days for institutional purposes

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
we support only a few institutional

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,319
customers

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
either directly or through trusted

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
partners

51
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
and we are also developing uh other

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
types of assets which includes

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
not only intelligence great zero day

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,319
exploits but also specialized offensive

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,280
and defensive tools and we deliver

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
off the shelf turncase solutions

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
which are state of the art

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
so what is the zero-day market today

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
from our perspective of course

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,959
um this is the commercial activity that

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
happens around the development of sale

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
of software

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
based on bugs which are unknown to the

64
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
vendors of the affected technologies

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
that's why the funny term zero day

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,799
was born because zero means

67
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,640
zero days since the discovery of the bug

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
which means

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
that the bug is undiscovered

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
this tools because basically an exploit

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
is a piece of software

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
can be used to remotely or locally

73
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
target a device

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
uh to tamper

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
with its security model and to control

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,239
it

77
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,159
in order usually to install some

78
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,879
specific software to collect data

79
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,439
or in other cases which are not

80
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
something that we we work with to

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
sabotage or damage

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,798
the the intended target in this case we

83
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
are talking about

84
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,320
cyber weapons i don't like this term but

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
it

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,440
it conveys the the the sense

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
so of course this kind of exploits are

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
extremely powerful

89
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
for institutional purposes because

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
because targets are unaware of their

91
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,240
existence and therefore

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
defense against them is extremely

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
complicated

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
but not all zero days are born equal

95
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,960
so there is only a small subset of zero

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,240
day exploits

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
which are sufficiently sterile silent

98
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,080
uh reliable don't generate artifacts

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,320
and therefore are highly valuable and

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,400
this is what we are dealing with

101
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,320
these assets have

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
significantly high values

103
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,120
on the on the market uh in the range of

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,440
hundreds of thousands to millions

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,479
of us dollars

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,120
what are the main issues with the zero

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,720
day market well

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
historically it developed in in a wild

109
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,639
way

110
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
so to speak so it's unstable

111
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,800
and safe it's chaotic and from a

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
business point of view is

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
quite an efficient

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
this of course nowadays is a problem

115
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,040
because these things are not

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,520
[Music]

117
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,039
let me say used for for performing tests

118
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,080
it is at least 10 years that the major

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,400
countries are using these tools to

120
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
perform their own

121
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
intelligence activities and

122
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,240
of course because of this this

123
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
tools have become highly strategic

124
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
so the fact that the market is

125
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
wild and researchers are often underpaid

126
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
while their efforts are getting

127
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
exponentially more complicated over time

128
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,880
is a problem also this creates a

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,360
talent vacuum because underpaid

130
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
researchers will seek more lucrative

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,479
fields

132
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
and do research as a second job or in

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,960
their spare time which is again

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,160
hampering the

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
overall usefulness

136
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,160
and possibility of deploying

137
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
good tools in the field

138
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,319
also from the demand side which is of

139
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,800
course

140
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,599
the the reason why this field exists

141
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,720
customers have no guarantees

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,680
they often rely on middlemen

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
intermediaries

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,360
and these figures usually don't bring

145
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
any significant added value

146
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
there is also a high risk of scams

147
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,639
quality issues

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,759
and financial losses in the end so what

149
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,639
we do

150
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
is really basically manage these risks

151
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,680
uh as it already happens in any other

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
normal field and to create and we create

153
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,000
a better environment

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
for developing

155
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,440
maintaining trading

156
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,639
and fielding these this

157
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
cyber tools which in our

158
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,160
opinion is beneficial to all the parties

159
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
involved

160
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,240
so what we did in the past four years

161
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
as we say we try to hack the zero day

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,599
market

163
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,840
by changing the rules a little bit

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,919
introducing new ways of doing

165
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,310
business

166
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,720
[Music]

167
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
the speed of the evolution is

168
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
astonishing so we need to catch up

169
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,840
and be always up to date

170
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
the variables involved are very complex

171
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
because this is not just a technical

172
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,680
issue

173
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
there are geopolitical strategic legal

174
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
financial ethical organizational issues

175
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
that must be handled and also

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,039
very very complex technical issues

177
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,320
so what was through five years ago

178
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,080
now is prehistory so what we do is we

179
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,959
try to anticipate this evolution and to

180
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,080
define it there are

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
many inefficiencies in this market

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
we set the goal to normalize

183
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
professionalize and streamline the

184
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
business by changing some of its rules

185
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,080
first of all we protect researchers with

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,279
fair contracts

187
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,160
and we offer them

188
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,519
high payouts for their efforts the

189
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,080
second

190
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
is we help to efficiently allocate

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,560
economic resources

192
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,360
and to minimize legal alternative and

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
reputational risks

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
and as you see this is not technical but

195
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
is paramount in a

196
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
complex and advanced um scenario

197
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
like the one we find ourselves nowadays

198
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
also we try to reduce unnecessary

199
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
middlemen

200
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,519
not all of them but those that are not

201
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,600
bringing added value

202
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
by building trust with researchers

203
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
integrators and customers

204
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
and finally we try to develop and to

205
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
spread

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,200
uh by example i would say new best

207
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,920
practices

208
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,519
standards and methodologies to approach

209
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,760
such uh complex multi-dimensional

210
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
problem so for example

211
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
we launched uh publicly our back bounty

212
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,000
program

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
which is of course a zero day

214
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
procurement program

215
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
starting in 2018 by offering uh

216
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
overall uh 10 million usds

217
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
for certain classes of exploits then

218
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
in 2019 we added more bounties and more

219
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
classes of

220
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,519
uh targets and we raised the

221
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,600
amount that we were offering to 15

222
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,959
million usd

223
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
which again we confirmed in 2020

224
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
and of course this worked so we could

225
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
acquire

226
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
very uh interesting and high quality

227
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
assets uh so in the end

228
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,200
by investing uh in a very um

229
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
careful way but with enough resources

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
by the end of 2020 we

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
put into this um

232
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,880
this market little bit more than 40

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
million usd

234
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
uh in less than three years uh of course

235
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
we are not dealing with a large number

236
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,040
of researchers

237
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,279
like some bad monthly platforms we are

238
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,720
dealing with a

239
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
few tens of researchers

240
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
on a average basis and overall

241
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
our network is probably made of no more

242
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
than 300

243
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
sellers which is more than enough

244
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
because this is

245
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,800
probably a significant percentage of

246
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,839
the the top tire of

247
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
researchers and developers in this field

248
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
worldwide

249
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
then we created a web-based application

250
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,320
which is the vulnerability research hub

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,639
it's reasonably safe

252
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,560
by design and implements a zero trust

253
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,839
model with a

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,279
good enough opsec i would say

255
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
for all the participants and basically

256
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
this tool is used to

257
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,399
submit uh research

258
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,720
by the researchers and then to discuss

259
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
test evaluate

260
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,000
and negotiate eventually um

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,480
purchase

262
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,959
the acquisition and testing process is

263
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,720
quite streamlined

264
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
and it goes through these six steps

265
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,160
but what i want to underline here

266
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,279
is that only a few zero days are good

267
00:12:59,279 --> 00:12:59,760
enough

268
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
for institutional customers

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
the intelligence grade zero this funnel

270
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,720
is very steep so out of 100 submissions

271
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,760
on average no

272
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
more than five end up being deployed on

273
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,440
the field

274
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,839
there is a lot of testing evaluation

275
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
rewriting

276
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,190
fine-tuning and and also

277
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,120
[Music]

278
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
some submissions are by nature

279
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,440
either to unnecessarily dangerous

280
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
which is something that we don't want to

281
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,480
to

282
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,839
deal with or not

283
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,839
requested by the customer so maybe the

284
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,920
zero day is good

285
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,040
and the techniques used are fantastic

286
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,680
but

287
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
there is simply no request for such a

288
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
thing

289
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,880
[Music]

290
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
okay but does it work

291
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
of course this is the the first question

292
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
right so yes it does but how

293
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
well first of all we do uh we developed

294
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
our own

295
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,360
methodology for assessment accessing

296
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
risks

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
related to each um this assets what we

298
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,800
you see here is a very very old and very

299
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,760
rough

300
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
uh preliminary version of this um

301
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
framework for assessing the risk of

302
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
this kind of tools this is from january

303
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
2018

304
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
so as you can imagine now this is much

305
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
much more complicated and

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
info includes many many many more

307
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
variables

308
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
but the the reason why i'm showing to

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
you is that i want to

310
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
explain that without doing this kind of

311
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
assessments how can you

312
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,240
handle this assets

313
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
it's extremely

314
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,959
dangerous to deal with

315
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,440
tools that can have a significant impact

316
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
on their targets or even on society as a

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
whole

318
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,079
without knowing exactly what they are

319
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,600
and what are the issues

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,720
involved in their and handling and in

321
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
their fielding

322
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
and of course based on this analysis

323
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
we will decide

324
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
if and when and to whom

325
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
we want to sell this kind of assets

326
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,279
by having a key risk index for each one

327
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,000
of them

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,199
that is of course updated over time

329
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
because situations change and some of

330
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
these variables are not

331
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,160
fixed in time

332
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,399
now here some qra statistics to show you

333
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,839
why this approach very structured

334
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:54,480
approach

335
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,880
works this is our data from our

336
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,639
2019 catalog of the 125 intelligence

337
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,160
grade exploits that we managed

338
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,360
in 2019 at the end of the year

339
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
93 percent were still zero-day and 89

340
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
were still available for sale because as

341
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,519
you can see from the

342
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,240
from the charts somewhere withdrawn some

343
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
were sold exclusively

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
so in our opinion this is a significant

345
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,800
result

346
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,519
because by managing these assets in a

347
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,920
proper way by doing risk assessments by

348
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
doing monitoring by doing

349
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
vetting of the end users

350
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,120
and so on we can in the end basically

351
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,839
extend the lifespan of these

352
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
assets significantly

353
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
and at the same time minimizing the

354
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
risks of

355
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
spillovers or unintended

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,040
side effects so basically

357
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
the return on investment from the

358
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
customer point of view on these

359
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
assets if managed in this way

360
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,799
can increase by 75 up to 200 percent

361
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
depending on the situation on their

362
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
application model on what they are

363
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,160
and also on external variables

364
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,839
uh still having a very high reliability

365
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
and very very low detectability

366
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,439
so the answer is it works

367
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
it definitely works it works for all

368
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
parties which is also important it

369
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
doesn't only work for customers it also

370
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
works in a positive way for researchers

371
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,480
so what is the future

372
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,559
of course this is just our opinion and

373
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
i have to be brief so this discussion

374
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
could be much longer but

375
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,200
let's just try to highlight a few points

376
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,160
[Music]

377
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,000
when we say we are trying to shape the

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
future zero day market we say that

379
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,799
we are trying to anticipate trends and

380
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,280
to study and to monitor

381
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,160
and to uh eventually have an impact in

382
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
their development

383
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,960
in order to optimize things

384
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
so for today i just

385
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
mentioned three of these trends there

386
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
are more

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
and again as i said this conversation

388
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,039
should be

389
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,919
much longer because the the details and

390
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,039
the variables involved

391
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,799
are really uh a lot

392
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,360
but let's stick to these three points

393
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
the first one

394
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
is that the age of the lone wolves

395
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,919
is almost finished for certain classes

396
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
of targets especially

397
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
the most advanced

398
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,840
classes of targets for example mobile

399
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
devices

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
finding valuable bugs and exploiting

401
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
them in a reliable and actionable way is

402
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:56,720
getting

403
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,520
harder and harder for individual

404
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,880
researchers

405
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,000
even if individual italians are still

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,559
and will

407
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
always be fundamental in this field so

408
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
research efforts must be handled by

409
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
large groups

410
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
in some places this is already happening

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
with very good results but it's not

412
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,520
yet a standard

413
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,440
so to speak the thing is these groups

414
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,880
must be managed in a professional way

415
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
and someone with dedicated know-how and

416
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
experience must take care of all the

417
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,000
non-technical

418
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,720
issues which are as i said previously

419
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
legal organizational financial

420
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,360
related to project management quality

421
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
assurance and so on

422
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,320
and these things are usually overlooked

423
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
by these groups uh with uh

424
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,240
which is creating inefficiencies and

425
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,559
then lowering the quality of their

426
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,919
outputs so what we are

427
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
starting to do is to offer our expertise

428
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
uh for the management of this kind of

429
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,159
endeavors of this kind of efforts

430
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
as a service to these groups by

431
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
partnering with them

432
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
and supporting them while they can focus

433
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,039
on the technical side

434
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,159
uh second thing we believe there is a

435
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,440
clear trend

436
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,400
towards the convergence of offensive and

437
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
defensive security activities

438
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
this was a taboo until uh

439
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
not so long ago and many people still

440
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
think that these two

441
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,840
areas should be separated as much as

442
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,120
possible and avoid contacts as much as

443
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
possible

444
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
except maybe for rhetoric activities

445
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
or some vanilla but bounty programs

446
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,159
and only to a certain degree now in our

447
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,320
opinion this is a waste of

448
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,559
resources and opportunities for both

449
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,919
sides

450
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,640
and we think that these two sides should

451
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,120
talk

452
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
much more and should collaborate

453
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
whenever possible of course and for the

454
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,080
reason

455
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
we already created defensive products

456
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,880
this is just an example also

457
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
from dedicated to the corporate world

458
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,320
not necessarily to

459
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,559
government customers so defensive

460
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,000
products that embed

461
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
all our offensive know-how and vice

462
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
versa

463
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
and it works you get the best of both

464
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,120
worlds you get something that is really

465
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
state of the art because of course you

466
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,159
can

467
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,440
use both points of view and both skill

468
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,559
sets

469
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,240
to achieve the intended results

470
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
and we will push more towards this

471
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
convergence in the next months of years

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,080
because we really believe this is the

473
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,440
future

474
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799
of security in general and of our field

475
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,919
in particular last

476
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,039
trend i wanted to highlight is in this

477
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,400
field there are still

478
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
no proper risk management process is in

479
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
place which

480
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
we already discussed previously and this

481
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
is a big problem

482
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,360
people are trading highly dangerous

483
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,679
assets goods without assessing their

484
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
related risks

485
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
the liabilities potential adverse

486
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
impacts on society

487
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,120
and and so on and

488
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880
this is a dangerous way

489
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
of doing uh business especially when

490
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,000
you're dealing with

491
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
very sensitive uh stuff like this

492
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,480
there is no other field uh

493
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,200
of human activities where people are

494
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
trading

495
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
goods which have an intrinsic

496
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,480
level of risk of this degree without

497
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,360
managing it and also the lack of

498
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,159
specific

499
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,880
oversight or the lack of specific laws

500
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,720
accept something related to do i use

501
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,559
technology export which is definitely

502
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,679
not enough to address all the issues at

503
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,080
stake

504
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,480
or maybe someone that is trying to use a

505
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
cvss score

506
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,000
to assess the risk related to these

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
assets which is

508
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,600
clearly not intended for this kind of

509
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,880
overall um assessment

510
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
of the of the dangers of of this of

511
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,280
these

512
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,799
assets um basically

513
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,919
this is a site for disaster

514
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
and we think this should be avoided it

515
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,919
can be avoided by

516
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,360
uh supporting the definition

517
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,080
of a new market standard for assessing

518
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,159
these risks in a systematic and

519
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,440
comprehensive way

520
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
which means in a multi-dimensional way

521
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,960
not only from a technical perspective

522
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,880
and of course we are

523
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
more than glad to collaborate with

524
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,440
researchers integrators and users

525
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,640
and also the general public on the

526
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
definition

527
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,520
of this risk assessment

528
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
standard in the next months we will

529
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
launch some initiatives towards this end

530
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
because we think this is now um

531
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
past you this is something that should

532
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,080
already exist

533
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
and the fact that it doesn't is a

534
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,279
problem

535
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,400
so again i'm

536
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,679

537
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200

538

539
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
sponsoring the concert track again

540
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,640
because

541
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,400
we really think that um this is a

542
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
useful way to support the community

543
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
which in the end is one of

544
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,679
our main goals thanks again
