book out ways

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
we started to look at smart contract uh

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
ever since bitcoin come back to the show

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
and then uh and then uh yeah so uh one

50
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
one surprises from from the thing is

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,840
that we started the scene the last in

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
december

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
i

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,560
blockchain and all these things you know

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,400
that old man he tells me uh we shouldn't

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
do that nobody wants to uh nobody wants

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,959
to do a

58
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
uh uh what wants to do a cryptocurrency

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,000
anymore

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,599
i said bro the price started get up and

61
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,200
say no i don't believe you

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,920
so do you look at smart contract and

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,239
then

64
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,040
we look at a few projects okay we look

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,319
at two projects like uh

66
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
obviously we look at ethereum 2.0 we

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,599
look at uh

68
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,879
uh and all these things and then

69
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,599
we decided when we tried to do research

70
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,959
into this project we should throw some

71
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
money into the project

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
and we make quite a fair bit since then

73
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,440
it was like a 10 15 actually hey that's

74

132
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
i still remember the incident at the

133
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
don't worry bro

137
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,759
for the internal blockchain

138
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
if you want to solve this two bitcoin

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
one inch

140
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
we will send you our wallet

141
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,840
so so so that will be yeah i was talking

142
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
to

143
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
when we started chilling we tried to do

144
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,639
uh

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,919
and iot and analyzing x86 binary you

146
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,160
know

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
whatever binary that we are looking at

148
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
right now in our computer to analyze we

149
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,840
have

150
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
tons of tools you know and and all

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
and and pretty much everything's in in

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
in in a very similar way you know

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
you need to set a big breakpoint you

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
need to look at the memory in new

155
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
registers and all these things and

156
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
when it comes to iot you have all these

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,279
multiple time tools that you know

158
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,559
to do this and doing that and to do this

159
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
and to do that you don't have something

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,720
universal to do

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
to do your analysis and an

162
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,000
instrumentation

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
whatsoever so we were like uh we should

164
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
maybe we should write a

165
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
a framework and then it runs on top of a

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
unicorn engine

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
and uh basically to write the os level

168
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,800
for

169
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
unicorn engine unicorn engine only empty

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
our only emulated cpu

171
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,880
so we should write our west level for

172
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,839
point

173
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,080
and the first argument that i jump into

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
the profile jump jump into which the

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,399
professor

176
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
queen is

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
it's a which os which language to choose

178
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
right so we are looking at brass when

179
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,959
you

180
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,240
things and then he says that that

181
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
project written in java

182
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
and my face and his face and we were

183
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
like such language exists no such

184
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
language brother

185
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,839
if it's written in java we don't touch

186
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
it

187
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
stay without titan the the thing is uh

188
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
we need to put into consideration

189
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
whether you know if you're a hacker you

190
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,680
were not fighting for sure

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
apparently yes so so so apparently yeah

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,800
that brings us a lot of uh

193
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
people joining the project okay uh we

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
are not big

195
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,519
you know like i want to discuss

196
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,920
yesterday

197
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,240
but we are definitely big in security

198
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
i mean probably better to be in that

199
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,839
space anyway right

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,880
experience for 56 into our iot

201
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,079
so now we'll go to the instrument to

202
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,079
debug iot to look at the memory to look

203
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
at the stacks to look at

204
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,320
the cpu register to do the power to look

205
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
at vm level we already have that that

206
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,839
kind of standard over there you know

207
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
for windows for linux for for iot and uh

208
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,560
when we look at

209
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,000
uh smart contract which we

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
did our very first uh demonstration to

211
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
the world today

212
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
so uh yeah so so that is uh that uh

213
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
it brings the same experience for x86

214
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,839
for iot

215
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,600
all the way to a smart contract so you

216
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,440
can look at the memory stacks you can

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
you can uh do a single step you know in

218
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,680
the debugger level

219
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
you can uh you can do your

220
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,040
instrumentation you can even do a hot

221
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,560
patch if you want

222
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,120
oh during your analysis so what that

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
then

224
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
you can you can skip certain parts if

225
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,800
you want to execute and only execute

226
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
that few months so that that

227
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
that is what we designed for the uh the

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,920
uh people

229
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
that wanted to do puzzles

230
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,399
so that is the the the guest appearance

231
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,800
for the for the

232
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,279
uh for the evm for actually that is our

233
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,800
pretty much our latest uh

234
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
invention of course at the main topic is

235
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,399
not about evm we were talking about

236
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,600
how we can integrate into our we always

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,839
wanted to have a very good uh uh

238
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,639
debugger

239
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,200
and we the the thing is we always do

240
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,839
five years

241
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,639
you know last last year's uh the three

242
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,440
virtual lab that

243
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
we did we're doing together it was with

244
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,200
ideapro

245
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,160
and ideapro it's a very good and strong

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,839
software for sure everybody knows it but

247
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,880
the thing is

248
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
expensive and the support with python is

249
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,639
always

250
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
somehow broken here and then when there

251
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
is solution upgrade and so on so forth

252
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
so that's why that's why we we

253
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,200
do a symbolic execution together with r2

254
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,920
and

255
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
that's basically the top population the

256
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
two new things that

257
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,680
we bring into uh cheating and hopefully

258
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,639
people will build

259
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
more cool stuff on top of it

260
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
you know i know right right now

261
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
i think uh he normally does all the

262
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
radar stuff

263
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
at hackathon i think like last year

264
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
2019

265
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,639
eighties or 2018 in fact he's already

266
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,480
been starting to like kind of like delve

267
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,200
into it

268
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,959
and most of the time he always speaks

269
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:35,839
about radar stuff at uh

270
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
fun guys they're hungry all right so

271
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,360
what's next man what's what's like now i

272
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,720
already got my contract [ __ ] what else

273
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,839
is going to be added to the

274
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,720
cheating framework uh they are looking

275
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,680
good

276
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
well there are two things that we are

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,800
still uh

278
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
thinking

279
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
so how we can make the uh how we can

280
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
make the uh

281
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
syscall and the windows uh uh uh

282
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
library emulations are more complete so

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
how we can forward the windows

284
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,399
more or less we have an idea and how do

285
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
we implement it that is a number one

286
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,839
which is not cool

287
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
it's a must have features but not cool

288
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
okay and uh the other thing is uh maybe

289
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
we should look at the m1 right now

290
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,519
oh yeah maybe m1 yeah yeah yeah

291
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
yeah yeah

292
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
so uh so how we can emulate m1 and all

293
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
these things are we are not too sure

294
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
whether does apple comes up with some

295
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
hidden cpu instructions or whatsoever

296
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,720
probably right yeah so

297
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,680
yeah if they're always silicate they

298
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
definitely would have written their own

299
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
you know nice little exotic thing that

300
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,839
the protection mechanisms and stuff at

301
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,079
the hardware level is all like their own

302
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,839
proprietary like nobody else uses the

303
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,360
same kind of style

304
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,120
or they'll try to but essentially apple

305
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
always be kind of like first

306
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
to experiment because they control end

307
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,079
to end right they control the software

308
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,320
they control the hardware

309
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,399
easy so yeah my guess would be

310
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
definitely everyone

311
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,440
confirmed what hidden instructions are

312
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
definitely

313
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,079
so even if we we don't we don't see

314
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
we still haven't seen any hidden

315
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,120
instructions in ipod

316
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
yet yeah because we haven't put

317
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,990
enough effort into

318
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,240
[Music]

319
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,680
the small little chips that uh run the

320
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
stm uh

321
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,399
uh sm32f4 f7 you know

322
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,440
to run

323
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
run this little thing that's falling

324
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,959
actually that runs that day so so

325
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,959
uh there is not much security research

326
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
on the mcu

327
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
uh from this years

328
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,120
we suspect we suspect there's not enough

329
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
tools to do analysis that people don't

330
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,040
even

331
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,839
care yeah because i mean how many people

332
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
really give with them whether like you

333
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,720
know the mcu

334
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,680
how many people actually know what the

335
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,480
hell an mcu is bro

336
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,160
other than you know drone enthusiasts

337
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,759
and stuff right like you won't really

338
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,920
get much exposure to it

339
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,639
and so you know uh i guess it's just

340
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,040
gonna

341
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,599
take some time

342
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
well you know our our community is

343
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,079
always

344
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
you know we have hardware hackers

345
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,919
to help the uh the entire industry to

346
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,799
explore more

347
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
types of vulnerabilities or another

348
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,000
class of of

349
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
our effect surface that uh that we're

350
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,000
looking at so yeah these are the few

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,799
things that uh that

352
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,950
[Music]

353
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,240
versus what the developers want to build

354
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
this is what people want right

355
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
and so i think you mentioned some

356
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,520
interesting stats about donations then

357
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,720
shipping you know has

358
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
donation button people can donate

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
throughout the project right but like

360
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
you know

361
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
what has been the finding so far have

362
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,440
you guys gotten much support or

363
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,559
financially at least

364
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,360
from from the community for to make the

365
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
project successful we do

366
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
have a certain group of people uh uh put

367
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,760
in a

368
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,640
donation we we i think we started with

369
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
uh

370
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,480
cryptocurrency uh uh donation that that

371
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,320
is that is last year when cryptocurrency

372
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,440
was the chip right so uh yeah then some

373
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
guys are donated

374
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,559
ethereum you know they did already

375
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,600
0.0.01 bitcoin

376
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,640
something like that so guys not bad

377
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
we have a lot of requests that uh they

378
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
wanted t-shirt

379
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
so we print out some t-shirts and then

380
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
uh it's not really making money it's

381
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,520
just like shipping then the t-shirt and

382
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
and the shipping is

383
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
damn expensive

384
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
stickers of course

385
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
we just wanted to test you know how is

386
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,919
the uh appreciation level

387
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,360
of the thing but but uh we do receive

388
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,960
quite a fair bit of feedback from uh

389
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
different uh companies those those those

390
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679

but it's still

396
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
they must be using it for reason before

397
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,080
they started to commit

398
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,160
codes and all these things you know then

399
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600

uefi innovation that is very very cool

409
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520

it's kind of cool

427
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,200
i mean we never expect that when we

428
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,799
started uh cheating we never expect we

429
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,240
have all these kind of uh we have all

430
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,880
this kind of

431
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
feedback we have a contributor from

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,640
france he even wrote the small little

433
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
plugin that you can

434
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
you can change all the different kind of

435
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,159
os state during the execution

436
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,159
so for example uh if you try to analyze

437
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,080
the malware the malware so

438
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
let's say apd apt is a russian-made apt

439
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,000
for example

440
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,480
for example huh and then uh normally

441
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,840
those kind of power

442
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,679
you will not be able to execute a

443
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
russian language keyboard

444
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
okay yeah so inside shilling you just

445
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
need to change one line

446
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,559
inside of a configuration path okay

447
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,520
right to switch to

448
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,280
whatever language you want and to run

449
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
the malware

450
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,400
so we have people coming with all the

451
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
brilliant ideas and all the brilliance

452
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
too so sometimes

453
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
do keep us you know motivate and uh move

454
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,320
on

455
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,679
the project to see more interesting

456
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,200
things from the community and how they

457
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
build stuff and how they analyze stuff

458
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
and uh

459
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,679
and sometimes when they how they ask

460
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,720
questions you know the issue

461
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,400
glad to see you guys are still enjoying

462
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,919
it because you know it's the passion

463
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
that keeps it going because clearly

464
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
it's not going to fund itself nobody's

465
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
donating [ __ ] so

466
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
basically everybody is like quoting it

467
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,760
because they love it right

468
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,120
so it's great that you guys are still

469
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
passionate about doing it and and

470
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
wanting to build it for yourself

471
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
because if not we won't have a cool tool

472
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,159
right there'll be no cheating basically

473
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
everybody will be kidnapped

474
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,440
