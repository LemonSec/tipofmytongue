1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,200
tell me guys what have you guys been up

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
to man for the last one year i mean like

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,280
yes we had still hacking around right

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,280
yes uh yeah all the

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,800
more time more sophomores i mean

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,600
many people are at home they are bored

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,119
they can go out so

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
so they are hiking even more

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
so that's good i mean for us we see a

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,230
lot of

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,960
[Music]

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
the level is going way higher so so

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,000
that's

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
awesome on the top of that many

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,559
companies they

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,559
they start to i would say i feel less

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,000
uh scared about the model

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
so yeah so that's good a lot of a lot of

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
company had to adapt with the new

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
pandemy switch to switch to online stuff

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,520
so they're also a bit more scared about

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
security and stuff to

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
wonder what can do about it but what

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,240
about when it comes to engagement i mean

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,960
like uh

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
engaging with a client i guess

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,119
previously right it would be

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,960
kind of like a face-to-face meeting or

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
you know

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,000
some kind of a legal framework

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
but now yes yes but uh yeah i mean we

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
are doing what everyone is doing

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
uh to explain to the clients

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
when we work with them we are doing it

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,400
not

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
overzoom but we have other ways to

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,650
communicate

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,720
[Music]

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
type of secure communication channel but

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
uh yeah they adapt on the on the good

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
things they are launching a lot a lot of

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,200
new apps

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
um because i haven't uh many businesses

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,119
which were

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
honestly we didn't suspect them that to

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,479
move to

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
volunteer things like that but they were

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
more i would say old school

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
yeah on uh from the next day they shift

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,439
and they say oh we will just have this

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,159
app

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,880
and uh no we are agile we want to really

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,360
squad

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
every week so we can do a fantastic yeah

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
agile yeah

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,000
i put it that way so that's very cool

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,879
uh we also are having like some company

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,599
i would say the

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,440
the way we work most of the company they

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
were a bit shy of going uh

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
public doing uh public but bounty

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,720
um but uh yeah on the next two weeks

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
i will launch two huge uh public but

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
volunteer with the asean company

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,580
so so yeah

66
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,799
[Music]

67
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,680
[Laughter]

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
no because everyone will start hacking

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
them oh yeah that's

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
that's true right so we can tell that

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
but uh yeah no it's very good and uh on

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
top of that

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
um something that changed uh quite a lot

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
in the past you say

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,879
six eight months it's really about uh

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
vulnerability disclosure

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
you know the uh the company uh

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
they were it's something they didn't

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
want to do

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,040
know what we see it's many many

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
companies they are putting in place page

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
where they explain that

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
if you discover vulnerability how to

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,319
report it

85
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
so i think it's a very good case and

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
they start to understand that

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,519
anyway people gonna hack whatever

88
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,480
happened

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519
and instead of just being all legal

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,360
threats and stuff like that

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
and it's way better to to tell people

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
okay if you find something just let us

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
know what's the vulnerability

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
i will not give you any reward because

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
it's really a passive way

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
of doing iet secrets but at least if

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
someone finds a vulnerability

98
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
they have a way to report it

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,760
i mean when uh when i was i was

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,959
way younger and i was still doing a lot

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
of hacking

102
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,159
how many times you discover

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
vulnerability on a website you are using

104
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,519
um you don't know what to do you find

105
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,640
something

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,519
you are like okay if i report would i be

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,560
prosecuted

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
what will happen so but if you don't do

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,680
anything

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
you keep the vulnerability form but

111
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
today this is something that companies

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,199
are really uh

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,280
understanding you know they say okay

114
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
it's really not

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
open or do whatever you want but if guys

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,960
are

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
are finding vulnerability in good faith

118
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
they are happy to accept it and to fix

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,000
it

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and to work with people i think it's a

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
huge change for

122
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
even two years ago yeah because i mean i

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,280
think uh

124
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
most bug hunters are always worried

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
about the legal ramifications

126
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
because you know different countries

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
have different laws right like

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
it might be okay in that country but

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
where you live

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
like for example we know hackers who are

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,639
from tunisia

132
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
and the law of there is very different

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
from france right

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
so there's always a concert that if they

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,919
disclose something

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
when the company presses charges they

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
could get into

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
some serious trouble yes and uh

139
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
that's why it's important because

140
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,120
anywhere all companies

141
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
um

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
people are developing more and more

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
application so

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
at some point it's really uh what do you

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,360
want is

146
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
you don't want to be aware about them or

147
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,320
you want people to to give it to you

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
so uh so no it's really uh i think it's

149
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
really shifting

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,919
so for us it's very very interesting um

151
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
at the same time uh for example uh

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
to know how to report we built

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
some tools for the community and because

154
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
i would say we have

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,240
we had quite a lot of not quite a lot of

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,720
time

157
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
but uh btk uh lucas was

158
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
he is doing an amazing job on because

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,199
he's hiking all the time

160
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
every time there is a need or something

161
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
is building a tool

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
and i think it's a good way to share

163
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
with the with the community

164
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,840
and that's why i bring him because i

165
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
could

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
i could explain the tools but i mean

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,120
most of them he built he built them

168
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,400
so uh on a really really good awesome

169
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,120
tools

170
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
on the so uh yeah i think it was like

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
uh okay if you want to share i can show

172
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,680
you a short uh

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
yeah show us what we've done sure is

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
brother yeah

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,840
uh let's shut the screen

176
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
okay so we got a small web page on the

177
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,520
github

178
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
with all our open source project uh

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
design designed

180
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
for archers so here is the short summary

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
the first one

182
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,479
is uh facts when you do

183
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,759
bug bounty or pen testing usually you

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
want to test with different profiles on

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
an application

186
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
you have like for example one user and

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,919
another one and you can check

188
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
that above isolated or iphone check the

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,319
different level of privileges but when

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
you do this in birth it's very difficult

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,960
to know which

192
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
request is made with which profile and

193
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,360
with pune fox you can create a

194
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
containers tab

195
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
so each tab will get one color and each

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
color will get its own cookie jar

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
and after that it will be reflected in

198
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
your

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
proxy so you know exactly what you are

200
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,639
doing

201
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
it's really simple but it's so useful

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,919
yeah

203
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,520
you can see how that can be definitely

204
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,758
useful

205
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
and color coded yeah that's amazing bro

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,400
yeah it's it's the the idea is not for

207
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
me it's from an nc group that did

208
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,680
something like that

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
for chrome but i don't like prom at

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
firefox

211
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,720
myself next one is just pub

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,199
yeah yes weber is every time i do

213
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
backbone through vs react i got a

214
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,440
problem

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
i'm a bit lazy and filling up the scope

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
for each program take a lot of time and

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,240
if i want to

218
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
act on different scope and change back

219
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,039
and forth it can be a bit dangerous

220
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,440
so i build a small addon that

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
automatically

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,919
connects to just react with your

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
accounts fetch your

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
fetch folder programs and display them

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,159
in the new tab and you can automatically

226
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,599
add automatically that you can choose a

227
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,479
program

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,440
choose a scope and decide what you want

229
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,399
to add to

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
your configuration so it's configured in

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
basically two or three clicks cool

232
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
if the program asks you to put like some

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
special headers or stuff like that

234
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,240
you will be able to do it

235
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
but yeah no other of the platform

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
they try to to do the same it's not as

237
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,240
cool as or

238
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
yes yeah on account you can download the

239
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,080
configuration but here you don't have to

240
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
download it

241
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
everything is not for you amazing

242
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
uh next one we'll talk about it later

243
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
but we got also

244
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
that php finder it's a small item that

245
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
will uh just show you on any website

246
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
if there is a vgp either on yes react or

247
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
any other platform or at least a vdp we

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,279
know about

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,760
or the vmg so it's a quick way to know

250
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,320
or

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
if i'm on the website i saw something

252
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,160
weird and i can check quickly there is

253
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
like a background sheet and

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
jump to it if there is one for example

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
on github i got some links and i can

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,839
check automatically the security.txt

257
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,519
it's a simple tool just to know where

258
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,000
you are

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,519
we also got some nice blog posts about

260
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,880
how to configure your burp

261
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,200
your bob with a lot of add-ons uh open

262
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,399
you to check it

263
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
and also the backpack compilation of uh

264
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
hacking links and uh

265
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
and blog and stuff like that that you

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,120
should read

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
we also made the dojo so dojo is a

268
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
training platform

269
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,360
uh but there is already a lot of

270
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
training platforms and what i wanted to

271
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,959
do is i want to focus

272
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,360
on how the exploit actually works in the

273
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
code base

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
so with dojo you got a good example like

275
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
this this is a

276
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,010
sql injection uh

277
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,160
[Music]

278
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
example yeah so you got your query and

279
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
you know you get your input over there

280
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,320
yeah

281
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
and you can if you try to do your

282
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
injection you will see in real time what

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,200
happened in the query

284
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
as you do your injection so if i

285
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
do like the basic r1 i can see like

286
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,399
where the sql syntax is moving and

287
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,279
what's happening

288
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,279
as i do the the the injection and how do

289
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:01,839
you require

290
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,399
impress change this example is very

291
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,839
trivial because there is only one

292
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,040
injection point and there is no

293
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
medication but if you

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
choose another training with some

295
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,959
filters

296
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
yeah i can try to do an injection

297
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,839
but my input is evenly heavily modified

298
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,440
so it's not as easy

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
as before i need to find another way to

300
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,720
do

301
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
some comments for example

302
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
but with this tool you can also if you

303
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,519
like this challenge but you want to do

304
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,079
it

305
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
a bit different and share it with your

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
friend you can just uh

307
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,040
copy the challenge and the addition mod

308
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
and here you can create

309
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
your own challenge as you want

310
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
of course some filters everything so

311
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
this is very useful if you want to

312
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,360
create

313
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
smaller ctf challenges yeah you can do

314
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
there's a lot of back ends like you can

315
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,920
use

316
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,200
injection xpath mongodb

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,440
xss you can even run your own javascript

318
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
code

319
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
and you can share it this is cool for

320
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
two things sometimes you just want to

321
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,720
share a challenge but

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,680
sometimes i got some weird expectations

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,800
and i want to understand what's

324
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
happening for example i got a

325
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,320
an injection but i i got my endpoint

326
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
injected at

327
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
at two points here either for example

328
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
email or username

329
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,720
equal to user

330
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
and he if i want to try to exploit and

331
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
wrap my head on what i'm doing

332
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,800
normally it's very difficult but here i

333
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
can see automatically uh both

334
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
points being updated at the same time

335
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,240
right so i can know if

336
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
the injection is valid or if i'm making

337
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
a mistake

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
yeah so basically where you need to put

339
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200
the escape characters yeah

340
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
that's it and you can quickly make your

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
mind about

342
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,200
uh what is happening there in the scene

343
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
like if you got an id you write your

344
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,279
what your idea of the request is here

345
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
you can try to do your injection

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
look what it's happening on the real

347
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
target and update your your guess

348
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,600
and try to work with this so hang on

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,519
this this dojo

350
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
tool it's open source right you can just

351
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
download it

352
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,000
uh dojo is not a open source but it's a

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,120
website you just

354
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
go to dojo.js.com and it's

355
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,959
there yeah there's nothing to download

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,720
okay and so when you

357
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,880
when you share challenges uh are they

358
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,920
public as in like

359
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
and can people design challenges and

360
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,240
then use that just need to copy the url

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
and you can share the challenge

362
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
so it's just simple that the rear the

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,639
url may be a bit too long for twitter

364
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,519
but

365
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
there is some short enough yeah you just

366
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
yeah i get a

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
url and the last one is uh

368
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,760
machine i oh no there is excess tool

369
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
also

370
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
uh and this one is totally crazy it's a

371
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
framework for writing xss because

372
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,079
usually

373
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
uh we always write the same kind of ecss

374
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
for the targets like we want to

375
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
get some serious arrive some token

376
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
use the token to do a post request

377
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,920
somewhere else and

378
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
it's always the same thing but you get

379
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,959
always stuck because

380
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
oh this time you are injecting in a

381
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
script tag or this time using the

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
uneven tag and i need to escape it

383
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,519
sometime i need to uri long-term

384
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,360
html filter and and there is some more

385
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
on top of that and so you cannot really

386
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,519
reuse your old payload

387
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,800
and you need to build something from

388
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
scratch every time

389
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
and because i had this problem i wanted

390
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,680
to create

391
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,839
a lib that will do this for me

392
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
so with this clip it's split in two main

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,199
parts

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,000
the first one is a payload builder so

395
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,959
you can create a payload with a

396
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,199
functional kind of syntax yeah for

397
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
example here i create a new payload

398
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,320
i say oh i want to add an exfiltrator an

399
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,519
exfiltrator is a small

400
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
function that will take care of getting

401
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
some data from my victim and sending

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,040
back to me

403
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,760
yeah there is a bunch of experimentation

404
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
available with the lib

405
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,639
yeah i will try it with first message

406
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
but

407
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,279
after that i do some computation on my

408
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,120
payload for example here i want to

409
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,959
get the document.cookie i want to

410
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,199
infiltrate it next i want to fetch

411
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,079
uh the dom on slash user slash me do a

412
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,519
query selection

413
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,800
and excitrate it and i can take this

414
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,160
payload

415
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
and after that i put it in a wrapper

416
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
the wrapper take the payload and i can

417
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
transform it for example i can do

418
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
oh i want this phone to be like a naval

419
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,399
base64

420
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,560
inside an svg unload inside any frame

421
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,000
first

422
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
and it will create this for you and

423
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
taking care of

424
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
all the escaping is done properly but

425
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
what is nice is if i want to reuse

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
uh if i want if i find another axis on

427
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
the same target i can just change the

428
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
payload and keep the wrapper

429
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
and i can just change the i can change

430
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,040
each part

431
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
separately and also i can change the

432
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
exfiltrator for example

433
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
here i am saturating with a

434
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,839
[Music]

435
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
simple the postmessage message is just

436
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,279
for testing because

437
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
this in a real condition uh i don't want

438
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
to switch it in the same browser

439
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
but i can just change it with like for

440
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
example a post request and i can still

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,399
get

442
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
still use the same payload as before but

443
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
change the way i'm exciting data it's

444
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:22,880
not

445
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
a gap request anymore it's supposed to

446
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,639
be pressed like that

447
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
if you want to look more with it there

448
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,720
is a full documentation with example for

449
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
every function and a more

450
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,160
example of all there is a bunch of uh

451
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,279
already built-in function very cool this

452
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
is python right

453
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,040
all you want with this and our last

454
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
tool for today is machine

455
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,920
and push machine is a easy way to

456
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,680
self-host

457
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,120
your pruning server this is the v1 but

458
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
the v2 will be released

459
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,559
very very soon like in next week or in

460
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
two weeks

461
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,400
and i will give you a short preview all

462
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,119
right

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
so the idea is you have this web

464
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,400
interface on your

465
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,599
server your server is running docker

466
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
and all your process will be run inside

467
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,880
docker and you

468
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
here you have like a wall management

469
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,599
interface so it will take care of you of

470
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
you you can see all your containers

471
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,119
what's running uh what it's exposed on

472
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,319
the internet or not

473
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
uh you can also configure your dns you

474
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
have a short

475
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
summary of all your rules you've got all

476
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,240
your

477
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
dns logs you can do some

478
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,760
everything is is basically it's

479
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,520
like uh management uh

480
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
system built in a web browser

481
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
but what it's very useful what is very

482
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,640
useful is because it's

483
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
built using a multiple brick that

484
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
work very well together for example if i

485
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,559
want to create a new container with uh

486
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,160
i don't know i want a new service i want

487
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,559
to host it's a center but i want it from

488
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,720
my server because i don't trust the guy

489
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,120
hosting it and i can just

490
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,039
say okay i want a new image say search

491
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,360
for accessory sensor

492
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
and if it's available on book hub i

493
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
should find it

494
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,960
okay uh oh no this is the demo effect

495
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,280
but

496
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
okay let's use

497
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,120
[Laughter]

498
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
okay so i can just exploit this will

499
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,960
start

500
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,880
recovering it uh getting it after that i

501
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
can start a container

502
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
and when my contact once my container is

503
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
ready i can just expose it on internet

504
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
i choose the port how to support and i

505
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,200
get all the domain available

506
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,640
basically it's a point and click

507
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,360
adventure to build your own server

508
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
cool man yeah it's awesome because uh

509
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,600
for everything like i don't know uh you

510
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,799
need a

511
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,080
connect bag or you need a ssrf

512
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,559
uh you have a ssrf but you are not sure

513
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,360
honestly

514
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
okay you can use burp collaborator but

515
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
it's not your own server yeah

516
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
um so at least or even if you want to

517
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:13,840
share

518
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
files or for like you are writing

519
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,799
uh um you have a poc for

520
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,760
for general ability and honestly the

521
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,280
only place that

522
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,000
you can more or less trust and to share

523
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,440
everything is your own self

524
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,720
yeah so instead of building everything

525
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,840
on uh and like people like me are a bit

526
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,600
lazy and

527
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,280
it's taking time uh you just use that

528
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
after five minutes you have all your

529
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
tools everything is just crazy

530
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
yeah if you need a someone that made a

531
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
good tool you can just

532
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,520
you pull you clicked it's up on your

533
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,960
server and you control everything from

534
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
the dns

535
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
to the ssl certificate because it will

536
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,640
uh if for example if you start a new

537
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
service and you put a domain name on it

538
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,159
put machine will

539
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,440
take care for you to put the wally card

540
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
ssl certificate validated with let's

541
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,919
encrypt

542
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,799
to do that we push the all the required

543
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,840
takes the

544
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,799
record of dns take care of everything

545
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,919
for you

546
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,240
because what i saw is a lot of hunters

547
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,039
use third-party website to

548
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,320
host uh payloads and callbacks like that

549
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,799
instead

550
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,919
and i think you shouldn't choose first

551
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,080
website when you are getting cooler

552
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
businesses yeah no kidding man

553
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,559
especially when you're using real

554
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,320
vulnerabilities don't send it to someone

555
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
because my theory was hunters are not

556
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
that i may be a bit lazy when it comes

557
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
to uh ambulances so if something

558
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,880
is doing everything for them they will

559
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
they will gladly switch to

560
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,799
more privacy definitely is this

561
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,919
available now for

562
00:20:51,919 --> 00:21:02,640
people to download let us know when you

563
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
are releasing it man we

564
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,200
will help to tweet it out as well

565
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,159
because this looks really cool

566
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
and i think that's it but sorry a lot

567
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,120
it's excellent man it's like you guys

568
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,960
have been busy man definitely been busy

569
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
bro like yeah i'm making good music

570
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,360
what else to do write code man

571
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
excellent excellent uh i don't think we

572
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,080
have any questions

573
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,000
from the audience let me just check

574
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,520
uh no we don't and we have about five

575
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
more minutes

576
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,360
is there anything you guys wanna tell

577
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
the world about

578
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,000
oh you guys have that yes we hack edu

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
platform right what is that about

580
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
sorry the edu platform oh

581
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
uh edu platform okay it's um

582
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,559
it's we are working especially we launch

583
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,039
it

584
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,840
uh for real uh during the

585
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,320
when everything uh locked on uh

586
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
at the beginning of kobe so the idea a

587
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
it's a training platform for

588
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,799
bug bounty so how it works it's a

589
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,039
real website with real vulnerability but

590
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,280
it's not like ctf

591
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,720
i would say where you know

592
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,799
you have the vulnerability on your flags

593
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,080
you have nothing like that

594
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,280
it's really real website and uh we

595
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,919
work with quite a lot of i think we have

596
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,440
more than

597
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,000
few thousand students on the platform

598
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,480
right

599
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
i'm still still uh many students are not

600
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,159
using it

601
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,200
in uh iit schools so

602
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,520
the goal is to for them to have like

603
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,880
real websites and

604
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,120
we have different level of websites it's

605
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,559
always the same

606
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
on the but all the vulnerability has

607
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,159
been fixed

608
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
from level one from platform one to

609
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
platform to

610
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,039
platform three so the platform one is

611
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
easy vulnerability uh seven level it's

612
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:06,640
more

613
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,760
uh had been patched but not properly the

614
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,400
third one

615
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
is super complex so um the idea

616
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,520
is because what's important when

617
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
you are doing when you are a fan tester

618
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
or

619
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
or even when you are beginning at i.t

620
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
security or

621
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,799
hacking you say it's sometimes if it's

622
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,240
too guided you don't take the the right

623
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
reflex where to look at how to do

624
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
so it's two part it's a real training

625
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
honestly

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,910
and then instead of having the

627
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,000
[Music]

628
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
just uh writing your report you write

629
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
your report in the

630
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,919
bounty platform which is dedicated for

631
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,720
it

632
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,679
um as a pen tester will do or as a

633
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,400
background

634
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
interview so you have the exchange with

635
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,120
the trainer the teacher on

636
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,520
it but you really in the place of a pen

637
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,060
tester

638
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,200
[Music]

639
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,960
so plugin only open to universities or

640
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
can anyone just join from the platform

641
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,559
no it's it's just for universities and

642
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
so if there's a university that wants to

643
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
to sign up for this uh how do they do it

644
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,799
do they have to pay for it or

645
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,520
during kovid it was free okay so we make

646
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
it free for everyone

647
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
but no we need to make anything

648
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,679
understandable and so yes but

649
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,039
it's honestly it's uh we do it

650
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,279
uh because honestly it costs us a lot in

651
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,400
terms of us

652
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
and it's almost a charity

653
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,039
uh we are definitely not doing that so

654
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,480
if there's an education institute

655
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,960
because

656
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,159
you know we work with the ministry of

657
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,240
education in uae right

658
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
uh and i'm guessing they would be quite

659
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
interested to find out more about this

660
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,559
or at least how

661
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,039
yeah definitely okay cool and i'll put

662
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:55,840
you in touch with them

663
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,000
because yeah we work with school in

664
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,360
france in singapore

665
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,720
and just full feedback

666
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
i mean it's uh it's like a real thing

667
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,760
it's uh

668
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,640
you change a bit i mean if i really like

669
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,520
ctf

670
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,440
or many people are very good

671
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
platform to work this one's a bit

672
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
different because it's

673
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,840
a bit more involved so you can train

674
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,120
your

675
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
you can improve your skills on dojo and

676
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,320
then

677
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,200
just as well so uh yeah i think for us

678
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,559
it's very important because

679
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,880
positive the backbone without an

680
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
inventor without

681
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
the account it's nothing

682
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,960
so it's very

683
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,000
i important for us a little bit and you

684
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,080
can give some skills

685
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,840
because even today you have so many

686
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,400
things to learn so many

687
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
so many things you have access to at

688
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,880
least we make platforms

689
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,279
where you can choice them yeah because

690
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,760
uh we always get questions from students

691
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,159
uh and they you know they can find ctfs

692
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,640
online but uh they are not guided right

693
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,159
and a lot of them don't know where to

694
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,760
start as in

695
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,600
they just you know want some hair some

696
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,279
reference to at least learn

697
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,919
and upskill but have it that is

698
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,279
challenging at the same time

699
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,440
uh and most ctfs online are like you

700
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,279
know expect that you already know stuff

701
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,000
right

702
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
so yeah yeah nice man so i think the for

703
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,320
that

704
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,240
especially for students the best is to

705
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
do um

706
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,159
because instead of i mean the

707
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,760
uh i would say something which is not

708
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,320
the problem when you start hacking it's

709
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,440
especially if

710
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
let's just take a simple example a

711
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
screen injection but we have many other

712
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,120
type of

713
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
navigation uh you are just entering the

714
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,039
cloud

715
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,200
and you have this payload like

716
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,360
you just launch the payload it works you

717
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,480
you get the flag

718
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,760
but the the main advantage with dojo

719
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
it's you really see the code so you

720
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,960
really

721
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
i mean anyone can do it if you're able

722
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,960
to do a

723
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,080
you have basic understanding of sql yeah

724
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,880
you are really able to see how it works

725
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,240
i mean it's like uh

726
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
you open the box and you look at your

727
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,520
injection

728
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,320
yeah and i think that's the best way to

729
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,200
learn

730
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
because you can even add some things and

731
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
uh it's

732
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
uh yeah honestly i would love to try

733
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,240
that before

734
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,039
my main goal is i want people i want

735
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,960
people to stop copy pasting payloads

736
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,860
they don't understand

737
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,939
[Music]

738
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,159
yeah but if i think some people manage

739
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:42,799
to understand

740
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,960
really what's happening i think it's

741
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,399
already a win yeah i mean

742
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,840
every little bit helps man every little

743
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,679
bit helps

744
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,279

745
