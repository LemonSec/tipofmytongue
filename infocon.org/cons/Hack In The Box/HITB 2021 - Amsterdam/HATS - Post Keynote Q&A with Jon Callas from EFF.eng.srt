6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,160
down to amsterdam last year and then we

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,840
said we move it to this year

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840

london

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,360
and then take the train to amsterdam oh

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,760
wow

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,720
um

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,839
[Music]

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,160
who could have guessed right who could

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
have guessed i mean um

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,320
i haven't left my house in a year bro

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,440
it's kind of weird you know like i

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,640
haven't been on a plane in more than a

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,520
year and it

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
feels so odd yeah

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
it's you know and you can see you know

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,920
it's like

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,159
my my 70s rock star haircut

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,960
which is you know i think i got it cut

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,280
in

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,040
like july well you look good bro you

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,759
look good so

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,119
you know i mean like maybe just keep

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,479
keep keep that look man it looks good

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,799
but yeah man just stop just stop

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,400
touching a bit about your your keynote

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
that you just gave right um

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,600
i was just talking to sriman just a

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
minute ago about

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,479
the fact that you know now that we're

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,920
with kobet and we have all of this

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
contact racing stuff

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,560
so in asia it's mandatory right wherever

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
you go into any mall or into any

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,040
restaurant or any any institute

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,119
basically you need to scan a qr code

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,360
uh it used to be that they would allow

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
you to just scan the qr code using your

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
phone so just a web browser and then you

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
could fill in anything you like into the

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
name into the phone number

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
uh and that's what i used to do right i

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
just used to put in a fake phone number

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,759
uh but now they've made it that you have

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,119
to use the app

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
and you know i'm just wondering what's

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,799
your thoughts about this man because

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
we're kind of giving up all our privacy

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,318
and we don't have a say in it right yeah

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,640
um well the eff opinion

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
the way that we have phrased it is we

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,959
don't want

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,879
any vaccine bouncers that

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,800
there are there are places where

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
vaccination requirements are appropriate

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
i mean you know it's like

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
universities want to reopen and

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,680
particularly when they are private

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
institutions

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
um they say you got to be vaccinated to

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
come on campus

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
that's fine but it's also what we would

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:44,800
call a

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
one and done thing you know it's like i

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
show you my card i proved that i got

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
vaccinated and then you let me on

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
but the things that we really don't want

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
is that we don't want to see a

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
surveillance system get put into place

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,360
that particularly one that is hard to

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,640
take down

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
because after

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,840
the 2001 terrorist things are like all

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,599
sorts of surveillance things that went

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,480
into place that

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
never got taken down again and

87
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
we also want to make sure that there are

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
there's proper equities in place there

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
are people who can't get vaccinated

90
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,159
there are people

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
who um can't afford phones

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,959
there's all sorts of places where

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,519
people will fall between the margins and

94
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,000
that's

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,200
a bad thing so

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,799
um there needs to be something in place

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,760
to accommodate them so i mean the

98
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,519
question is bro i mean

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,799
what is going to be in place you know

100
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
what i mean like as hackers right what

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
can we do because at the end of the day

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
we are only a small portion of society

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
right and the bulk of society wants

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,519
everything to go back to normal

105
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
no matter whatever it takes and if you

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
think of september 11 as an example

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
right like air travel completely changed

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
right we take up our shoes and we take

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
our laptops out of our bags because why

110
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
it's beauty theater right i mean it

111
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
makes everybody feel safe but it doesn't

112
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,280
actually

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
do anything but that was all fine and

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,879
well because the

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
data wasn't exactly being collected or

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,000
stored or you know

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,399
referenced but now with contact tracing

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,000
right like they store it for a certain

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,199
amount of time because obviously they

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,320
need to trace

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
whether you've been in close contact

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
with somebody who has copied right but

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,840
how long is that data going to be

124
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
sitting around for and more importantly

125
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,479
like

126
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,880
you know can we ask for it to be removed

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
right i don't i don't really think

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
that's been nobody's been

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,680
really talking about that right like and

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
before we know it

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
it's going to become like de facto and

132
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
then it's too late to put the genie back

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,600
into the bottle

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
yeah i you know it's like

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
let me be a little hopeful

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
and say that we are very

137
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
fortunate that

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
the vaccines are better than anybody

139
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,320
thought they were going to be

140
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
they've been coming out faster than

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,759
anybody thought they were going to be i

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
was pretty cynical about things

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
a year ago and

144
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
the good news keeps coming

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
so i think that

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,280
what we are dealing with right now is

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
mostly supply chain issues

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,039
because you know it's like we have to

149
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,520
get we have to get seven billion people

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
shots and um

151
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,960
that's a huge logistical problem

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
the good news that we're seeing out of

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
the way that they work

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,039
is that that um

155
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
we may not need a booster

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
or mederna has already said

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
that they have prepared a third one

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
that is an improved

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
vaccine against the covid spike proteins

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
and they're even saying they might be

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,120
able to take on

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
all sorts of other coronaviruses so this

163
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
messenger rna stuff is

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
really cool oh yeah

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
i mean there's definitely a little hope

166
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
there's definitely hope

167
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
but you know i mean i'm just worried

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
that people are just gonna

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,880
not bother you know what i mean be

170
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
thinking about uh how that data is going

171
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
to be abused i mean i'm always

172
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,319
i'm always concerned about that people

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
give up our privacy so easily

174
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,240
without really thinking uh we used to

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
make a big deal about foursquare like

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
checking into post square right was

177
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,479
always kind of like hey look at that

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,080
silly guy checking into foursquare

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,199
you know telling the whole world what

180
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,360
he's eating for lunch and blah blah

181
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,199
but uh that was fine because it was just

182
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,400
shared with your facebook and your

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
social media and stuff and you know but

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,440
now if it makes it mandatory

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
i think kuwait passed a law that if you

186
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,440
don't get vaccine

187
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,800
right you can choose to not get right no

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
problem but you cannot attend university

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,160
as you just mentioned like usually you

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
don't get access to education

191
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,080
uh you can't travel which is a big one

192
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
everybody wants to go for all today

193
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
and you know and and you can't get

194
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
access to the mall i mean like that's a

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
big one i think like you know most

196
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,479
people need to go to the mall at least

197
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,160
sometime just to just shoot degrees

198
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
right but they're making that mandatory

199
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
that if you don't uh

200
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
don't get your backseat you don't get

201
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,000
access

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
the the civil liberties part of me

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
and the public health part of me are in

204
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,599
tension with each other

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,639
because you know the the the quicker we

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
get to the vast majority

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
of us being vaccinated the more that we

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,039
can cut

209
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,240
a lot of this down and

210
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
um on the one hand we're seeing that the

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,039
vaccines

212
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
are extraordinarily effective and if you

213
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
think about it in terms of our rights

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,479
perspective

215
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
the dangers of not being vaccinated are

216
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,639
that you're a danger to yourself and

217
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,240
you're a danger to others

218
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,560
yeah well the more that you're the

219
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,199
danger to others goes down

220
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
the more that we can say hey why does it

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
matter that they don't get if they're

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
only hurting themselves

223
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
and i think that that is a

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
thing that the insanity that we have in

225
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,080
the u.s

226
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
which is a different insanity than that

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
one

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
um they're it's amusing

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,919
that that you know free doughnuts

230
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,879
or a lottery ticket will get people to

231
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
decide well okay i'll get vaccinated

232
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,960
when they were pounding their fists 10

233
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,759
minutes before

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
saying they weren't going to um

235
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
but i'm not

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,799
quite ready to really venture out

237
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,839
i'm like three weeks past my second one

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
and i went out to a restaurant with

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
friends a week ago

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,160
and um my partner and i

241
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,360
it's like today slash yesterday was her

242
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
birthday and so we're thinking that

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
we're going to go out to a french bistro

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,200
and have state priests this weekend in a

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,040
bottle of wine

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,959
and i'm kind of feeling like that's okay

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,480
but there are other things where i'm a

248
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
little nervous about it's like

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
i'm really not sure that i want to get

250
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
onto an airplane for another few months

251
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
and it's not because

252
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,480
of health concerns it's because

253
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
i'm afraid things are just going to be

254
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
all messed up

255
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
um we have gone

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
on a music festival that is on a cruise

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,600
ship

258
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
for a few years now and we

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
did not sign up for the next year one

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
not because we thought there were health

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
considerations but because

262
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
there's all sorts of insanity of things

263
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
like

264
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
the cruise line has said we're going

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
they're going to demand that everybody

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,200
gets vaccinated

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,160
the governor of florida says you can't

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
do that you can't force people

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
and so the cruise line says fine so

270
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
we're not going to we're going to sail

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
to miami anymore

272
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
good reasons that are unrelated to the

273
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
public health issues

274
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
yeah but i mean you may have an

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
interesting point as well because you do

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,839
think that

277
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,360
are going to change i mean like defcon

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,959
right 20 000 30 000 people

279
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,320
you know like will we see events of that

280
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
size

281
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
in the next i don't know let's just say

282
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
two years maybe

283
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
i don't think so you know i have a few

284
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
thing that we're gonna go back to

285
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,160
much smaller interactive or maybe like

286
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,880
hybrid

287
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,399
kind of style because people have gotten

288
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,959
used to staying at home unfortunately

289
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,480
right you know zoom has now become kind

290
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,079
of like the factor conference delivery

291
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,360
method right

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
so i'm worried about that you know that

293
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
people were just kind of like well i

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,760
don't feel like traveling i haven't

295
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
traveled so

296
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
i'll just stay at home and i'll skip the

297
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,000
conference maybe

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
and it the community will kind of

299
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
disintegrate in a way right if you think

300
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
about this security community

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,480
we used to go and meet each other almost

302
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,399
every summer right like it was like a

303
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
thing on the calendar right

304
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
i i think that things will get better i

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,959
mean i agree with you that things are

306
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
still going to be a bit of a mess

307
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
two years from now but five years from

308
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,000
now i think things are going

309
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
to be a lot more like normal but i also

310
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
think that these hybrid conferences

311
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
are a good idea um you know there are a

312
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
lot of people

313
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
for whom i'm i'm partially deaf

314
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
and because of that

315
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
this is really good for me i mean if we

316
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
were in a noisy room i would

317
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
really be having a bit of trouble

318
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
listening to you

319
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,040
but over zoom i mean it was like you

320
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
know zoom is great for us hard of

321
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
hearing people

322
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
sure sure in fact i was suggesting i

323
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,480
think i had a chat with some conference

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,680
organizers and i was saying wouldn't it

325
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,240
be cool

326
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,680
because i'm into ai uh that we use gpt3

327
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
to do live transcription so then we can

328
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,800
do foreign language right and we could

329
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
have speakers speaking in japanese or in

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
chinese

331
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
and because that's easier for them to

332
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,440
communicate in but then we will be able

333
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
to read the subtitles on the fly right

334
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
because subtitling is normally a very

335
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
human intensive like doing live

336
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,920
translation it's human intensive it's

337
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,800
crazy

338
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
but it'll be so cool right like we

339
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
should use the technology for that right

340
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
and

341
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,680
make it more inclusive so that you know

342
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
people uh more people can can

343
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,480
participate that's

344
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
quite cool and and

345
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,880
there's a lot of people who are

346
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,519
really want changes in the way that work

347
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
is going

348
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,519
and there are people who don't but one

349
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,200
of the things that i'm finding

350
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
is that we're finding common ground eff

351
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
is a very san francisco organization

352
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
i mean it's been in san francisco and

353
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
it's always been you need to be here in

354
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
san francisco

355
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,120
and some of the benefits are related to

356
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
the fact that it is an organization in

357
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
an expensive city

358
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
so it helps people afford living in an

359
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,560
expensive city

360
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,720
but my group which is the tech

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,000
projects group we're just fine staying

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,560
home

363
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
it's like you know one of the people in

364
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,399
my group she says

365
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
if i stay at home nobody steals my lunch

366
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,440
i can play music that i like i can do my

367
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,320
programming

368
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,079
and i'll come out and have drinks with

369
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
you after work but

370
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,360
no i'm gonna work here and

371
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
um i live like about an

372
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
hour away and one of the other managers

373
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,560
who works for me lives about an hour

374
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
away north of san francisco

375
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
and so we're perfectly fine with

376
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
continuing to work we've

377
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,800
shown that that we've been incredibly

378
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,279
productive the last year

379
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,360
um so we're for our group

380
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
looking at how we might be able to do

381
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
things

382
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
like be able to hire people

383
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,839
outside of san francisco that

384
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,519
have skills but don't want to move to

385
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,959
san francisco

386
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,800
because we're already doing things

387
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
remotely now

388
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
the lawyers for example you know it's

389
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,680
like i joke about this and i say that

390
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
you know people whose job is sitting

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:17,920
around

392
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,079
people arguing with each other want to

393
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,680
get back into a room where they can sit

394
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
around a room and argue with each other

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
but the people who want to hold 50

396
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,440
things in their head while they type

397
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,160
them in

398
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
they want a nice quiet room and not be

399
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
disturbed

400
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
well the fact that the tech people

401
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,639
aren't around the office so much means

402
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,519
that there's more space for the lawyers

403
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,360
so you know it's like the lawyers are

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
going oh really i really you don't need

405
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,959
that office i'd love to have that office

406
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,440
fair point um john we have a question

407
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,560
from one of the listeners

408
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,519
he agrees about the privacy part of the

409
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,760
presentation but about the part of

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
personal censoring um he has a couple of

411
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,199
questions

412
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,839
the first one is are you not afraid that

413
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,680
by selecting only comfortable

414
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,240
end according to someone correct

415
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,959
information

416
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,440
provided instantly that you are creating

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
a technological protective

418
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,240
bubble that in the long run would make

419
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
people unable to have a normal

420
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,639
conversation without those filters

421
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,360
there's a lot of things that can go

422
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
wrong

423
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
and and i mean i am you know i am

424
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,160
worried about things like that but i

425
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
but i also think that you know it's like

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
i'm you know i'm trying to

427
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,560
point towards a future that we could

428
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,680
build

429
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,800
and um the fact

430
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,360
that there are lots of us who will who

431
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
are going directly to the

432
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
here are the things that go wrong this

433
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
is precisely the skills

434
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000
that we have and by seeing the problems

435
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,120
ahead of time

436
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
and saying that we need to build things

437
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
and to not have these bad things happen

438
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
but we want the good things happening is

439
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,600
what we need to be able to do to get

440
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
there

441
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,440
and you know and nothing's perfect

442
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
right does that mean you know does that

443
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,759
make any sense

444
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,839
it does to me it doesn't

445
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
his follow-up question is is there not

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
the same problem that with all tech that

447
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,759
someone will use this link

448
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
to link to truth actually spreading your

449
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,920
message

450
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
or even commercial spots provided to

451
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
input your version of the truth inputs

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,279
to these kinds of solutions

453
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
um i didn't follow all of that

454
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
but i'm going to agree that yes yes

455
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,360
yes and you know and and you know

456
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
you know you know again this is what

457
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
we're good at

458
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
we're good at seeing problems ahead of

459
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
time and saying what are we going to do

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,240
and and um you know i'm a late career

461
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
person i'm an old person

462
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
you know it's like it's like young

463
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,679
people have

464
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
new brilliant ideas and i have faith in

465
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
them

466
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,400
that that there are all sorts of people

467
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
who will think of ways to do that and

468
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,640
what i

469
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,959
want to do with this talk and other

470
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,799
things is to say

471
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,640
yes there is a future that we want to

472
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
drive to and the road is going to be

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,360
bumpy

474
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,679
and i don't have all of the answer but

475
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,840
we've got lots of smart people

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,240
around

477
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,320
all right yep yep i guess that sums it

478
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
up that sums it up

479
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
i mean there's not much else to say

480
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,080
i think cooper had a question as well

481
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,880
let me just take a look here

482
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,200
uh so yeah so cooper wanted us to just

483
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,640
ask you this right basically

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,600
you know if authorities try to surveil

485
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,919
but

486
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,919
uh you know ad companies are trying to

487
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,039
sell your

488
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,280
info to the government right would

489
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
changing the tos

490
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
actually help or not because you know at

491
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
the end of the day

492
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
people don't really read the us anyhow

493
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
right

494
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
um i think that there are

495
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
a lot of trends going on now that will

496
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
help i mean one of the reasons

497
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,280
why i made a pivot from being

498
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
in tech companies to being in

499
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,320
non-profits

500
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,919
is that i think there's a lot of

501
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,640
problems that we are going to be solving

502
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,200
through

503
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,799
policy and you know meaning you know

504
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,160
laws rules etc

505
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
that that the technology itself was not

506
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
going to do

507
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,559
correctly um i am a huge fan of gdpr

508
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:44,960
it's

509
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
not perfect but i think it's an

510
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,000
absolutely wonderful

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,080
way to go forward here in the us

512
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
uh there's a california privacy law that

513
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,919
is pretty good it's not perfect either

514
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
we're getting a few other ones and we're

515
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,840
getting also

516
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
some other things around that are really

517
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
cool

518
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
like the state of illinois has a

519
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
biometric privacy law that they've had

520
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,679
for years now

521
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,240
that has been highly effective there's a

522
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
whole bunch

523
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
of biometric tracking where if you

524
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
happen to

525
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
live in illinois so you know you live in

526
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,760
chicago you get privacy protections that

527
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,120
are better than anybody else in the

528
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
world does for biometric protection

529
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,440
because

530
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
they've got this law and they allow you

531
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
to sue people um

532
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
and i think that as we go on that we're

533
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
going to get some more of these europe's

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
going to do a good job

535
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
gdpr has been nice because a bunch of

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
companies have done things

537
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
like say gdpr is our privacy policy

538
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
worldwide

539
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
i mean it's it's easier to only have one

540
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
and if you went through all this trouble

541
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
for gdpr why not do it why not just do

542
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,240
it that way

543
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
and if we start getting a consensus for

544
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
how we manage this privacy

545
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,720
it will be good but yes i mean

546
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,240
this is that you know this is part of

547
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
the slog that eff does

548
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,120
is that we are

549
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,039
campaigning and leading for

550
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,880
and um exposing the things that the ad

551
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,799
tech people do

552
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,000
because by exposing them and explaining

553
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,799
them

554
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
people understand what what they

555
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,799
should be against because you know it's

556
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,080
like

557
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
we security people will tell people oh

558
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
my god there's this horrible thing going

559
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,600
on

560
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,159
and they kind of look at us funny until

561
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
we demonstrate it

562
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
you know just like just like the old

563
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,799
saying you know i

564
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,080
i want i want a pop or gtfo is

565
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
that is that people who aren't us want

566
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
an equivalent of a pot

567
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
and by exposing these things we're

568
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,000
showing

569
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
what the the harms really are and we can

570
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
get them behind

571
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,840
these sorts of changes

572
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,280
that make sense i don't think we have

573
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,080
any other

574
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,600
questions but srimad do you have

575
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
anything that we wish to be i mean it's

576
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
very rare that we get john

577
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,000
to be just ready and available so let's

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
go ask him anything we want and plus his

579
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,799
eff right

580
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,799
yeah uh does anyone have any last minute

581
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,480
questions anybody have any questions

582
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
maybe just like let us know in the

583
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,799
discord

584
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,360
else we'll let john go because yeah it's

585
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
been a long day there was one last one

586
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
it's a bit generic so um you can answer

587
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
how you wish um

588
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,600
do we think our insurance response

589
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,559
differs too much

590
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
our internet what internal responses in

591
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,720
from

592
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
uh like from organization to

593
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
organization i would assume so yeah

594
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
it's the question was do you think our

595
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
incident response differs too much

596
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,320
yeah i mean we could go from

597
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
organization to organization yeah

598
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
scenario

599
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
yeah do you think that yeah so the way

600
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
that organizations are handling

601
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,760
internal response some of them tend to

602
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
be a little bit more forthcoming with

603
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,039
what exactly happened and and also

604
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,000
letting people know what they're going

605
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,200
to be doing to not

606
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,240
you know prevent that from happening

607
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
again but then there are other companies

608
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
that just

609
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,840
can't be bothered i suppose or maybe

610
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,960
they just sweep it under the rug and

611
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,080
hope that it doesn't leak

612
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,159
because uh it's only when it hits the

613
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,760
news then they're kind of like oh damn

614
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,039
we need to do something about it right

615
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,559
and they hope that nobody finds it so

616
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,760
that they can just

617
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
ignore it like what you said yeah yeah

618
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,880
so maybe i don't know

619
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,159
do you have any thoughts on that online

620
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,159
maybe how incident response could uh

621
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,400
maybe be playable standardize yeah be

622
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,840
standardized in some way maybe i don't

623
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,960
know

624
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
um i'm not sure standardizing

625
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,600
is always the right idea

626
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,640
um i think that we should

627
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,480
continue to think about how we do things

628
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,799
and

629
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
do them better but one of the things

630
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,760
that concerns me about

631
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,919
incident response is that we have this

632
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,200
tendency to make it

633
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,919
be a tussle between the security

634
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,720
researchers

635
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
and the vendor and nobody is looking out

636
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,799
for the end users

637
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
and and this falls into things

638
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
like when we when we

639
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,760
finally talk about what vulnerabilities

640
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,679
and exploits existed

641
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,520
the people who for

642
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,000
usually bad reasons but sometimes good

643
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,159
reasons are lagging

644
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,679
um they're now vulnerable in ways

645
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,840
that is not really right

646
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,320
and and an example

647
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,440
of the more generic answer came out a

648
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,880
few days ago

649
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
where these ransomware people got

650
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
alerted by a security company that they

651
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,279
were doing their crypto

652
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,799
wrong and they fixed their crypto and

653
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,870
ransomware

654
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,600
[Laughter]

655
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
so so you know that i view that as an

656
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,480
incident response

657
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,120
failure the bad

658
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,279
so that you know that's one of the

659
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
things that we want to do and i will

660
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
admit that when i have

661
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
been because you know it's like i'm

662
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
primarily a developer and that's one of

663
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,000
the things that you need

664
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
to to realize is that i come at this

665
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,679
from a product designer and software

666
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,679
engineer point of view

667
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,880
i have buried

668
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
fixes to really really really horrible

669
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
bugs

670
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,400
in things because i didn't want it for

671
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,320
people to be easy to find them i knew

672
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,559
people would be tiffing the code

673
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,080
so you know it's like i you know this

674
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,919
you know and and you stick it in the

675
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,080
middle of 100 megabytes of other things

676
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
that you're doing

677
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,000
and you know and say oh look over there

678
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,960
yeah exactly

679
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,240
and you know it's like

680
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,440
if you look at what changes get done on

681
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,240
software

682
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
you know there are little hints like

683
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,520
improves

684
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,880
stability you know when you see improved

685
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,760
stability

686
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
install it right away

687
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,360
[Laughter]

688
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
because that's how a software engineer

689
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,440
says oh dear god this is exploitable

690
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,080
what about like what about uh embedded i

691
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,039
mean what we're going to do about

692
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,640
embedded the fact that you know a lot of

693
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
the

694
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
iot devices for example right like

695
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
they're using really old linux uh

696
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
dlls or whatever like you know library

697
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
files right and they are unpatchable

698
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,120
because they're burnt onto the chip

699
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
right so

700
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
those guys really really are sticking it

701
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
somewhere where hopefully nobody will

702
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,559
see

703
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,400
um this is going to be a thing

704
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
that we society need to

705
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,480
handle in the ways that we have done

706
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
other things in the past

707
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,000
for example consumer reports which

708
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
is an organization in the u.s that puts

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
out magazines that

710
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,240
rates automobiles washing machines

711
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,360
stereo systems etc they now have

712
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
a digital lab in silicon valley and

713
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
they've hired

714
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,080
writers that i know who are fantastic

715
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,600
writers who've been putting out

716
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,640
putting out cyber security articles

717
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,279
they're testing stuff this is one of the

718
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,799
things that will go forward

719
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,559
when i was at apple my team was working

720
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,720
on how you would get something certified

721
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
for home kit

722
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,880
and we were saying that we would not

723
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,679
simply do

724
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
things like protocol tests so that you

725
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
could do home check

726
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,159
correctly but we would do things like

727
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,320
um essentially some sort of

728
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
of attacks against the device we would

729
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
do things like

730
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
make sure that it was running a decent

731
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,720
operating system version we would test

732
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
all sorts of other things for the

733
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,760
overall cyber security of the device

734
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,200
before we would do this and if the

735
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,159
ecosystem people who are making things

736
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,880
like you know

737
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
apple google amazon baidu you name it if

738
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
they're going to be

739
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
doing things where they take seriously

740
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,760
their

741
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,400
responsibility because we have

742
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
we have other things in other parts of

743
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
our society

744
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
where if you want to put food into

745
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,159
grocery stores

746
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
it will go through certain amounts of

747
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,360
testing there are

748
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,520
there are processes in place you just

749
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,200
don't throw it over there

750
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
and we need to be bringing those sorts

751
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,039
of things

752
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,440
into what we do and um

753
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,360
it's going to be a rocky growth to get

754
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
there because there are some things that

755
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,640
are good ideas

756
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,080
things that feel like good ideas and

757
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
things that may not be such good ideas

758
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,240
um and we don't know we don't know we

759
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,399
don't know how to navigate this space

760
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,719
yet

761
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,919
make sense yeah do you have any other

762
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,399
questions

763
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,679
we do have one more here by fish again

764
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,640
um so his question is john gilmore

765
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,880
presented on ccc congress

766
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
nothing to hide once his statement about

767
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,799
privacy was

768
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,200
or we need to make all privacy data

769
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,080
public

770
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
so you can't steal it anymore or we need

771
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,919
to

772
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,000
accept it's going bad at once and we

773
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,360
lose our data

774
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,679
how do you think about this now 12 years

775
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,720
down the road

776
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
i think we can do better i think i think

777
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,240
that john was reflecting

778
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
a thing that was going on

779
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,279
[Music]

780
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,799
like you know 12 or 15 years ago where

781
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,679
people were saying

782
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,840
oh my god everything was broken and

783
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,960
we have been managing to fix

784
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
a whole bunch of things and while

785
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
things are still broken they are broken

786
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,880
differently and we're seeing a lot of

787
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
progress

788
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,919
in places like i am thrilled

789
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,000
that we now have memory safe things like

790
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,679
rust going on we have rest being

791
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,279
done in places where we can be

792
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,679
thinking about building roms

793
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,720
network infrastructure etc where

794
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,919
we're doing stuff that is better on

795
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,320
that that we're actually

796
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,559
starting to get better

797
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,799
not only at software engineering with

798
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
tooling but explaining why we need to

799
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,880
change what we're doing

800
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
um i have some friends who

801
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
keep track of bugs and so on

802
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
and approximately two-thirds of all bugs

803
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,159
are memory

804
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
safety issues and they're

805
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,679
drumbeat on how memory safety

806
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,919
is two-thirds of all of the problems is

807
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
making headway

808
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,840
i mean you know like you know like i

809
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,600
said before the

810
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,559
security stance that we are in now is

811
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,440
better than we were in 20 years ago

812
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
i think that we're going to make

813
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,039
progress on a whole bunch of stuff

814
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,600
because we're going to demand through

815
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,799
not only laws but we're going to have

816
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,000
testing organizations that are going to

817
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,480
be

818
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,320
independent and go and and call

819
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
bs on people who are building horrible

820
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
stuff

821
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,640
and we're going to have better tooling

822
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,559
to make better things

823
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,520
so we're seeing the groundwork

824
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
being laid for where we can have an

825
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
increasing amount of security throughout

826
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,120
the whole system

827
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,640
yeah how long do you think that would

828
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
take to to at least

829
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,640
form the foundation of it

830
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,840
when it would actually start being

831
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
audited or being raised as concerns

832
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,679
quite often

833
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,200
i think things will i think things would

834
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,840
be a lot better in 20 years

835
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,810
[Laughter]

836
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,519
yeah do you think that um

837
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,679
you know i mean come on 2 000 was only

838
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,799
20 years ago

839
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,000
yeah that's true that's true that's true

840
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,840
yeah yeah it feels like it was like

841
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,360
not as long ago but actually yeah 20

842
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,039
years has flown by that is that is true

843
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
so it will fly by as well but do you

844
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,159
think that um

845
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,320
quantum is going to help at all like you

846
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,440
know there's a lot of people who say

847
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,720
like quantum

848
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
encryption and quantum computing is

849
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
going to like be the next level of stuff

850
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,279
right

851
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,559
do you think that's going to be true or

852
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,000
another thing i am a soft

853
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,120
quantum skeptic okay and what i mean

854
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,039
what i mean is i think it's harder than

855
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,039
i think it's going to be

856
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,320
um i i think

857
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,120
that while we are going to have quantum

858
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,320
computers

859
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,399
that will break a lot of the

860
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,200
cryptography that we have

861
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,399
i think that they won't be able to break

862
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,120
something like

863
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,360
4k rsa before 2050. and again 2050 is

864
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,880
only 30 years from now

865
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
sure you know um

866
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
i think that building

867
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,880
quantum systems of the sorts of things

868
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
that really are you know the dream

869
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,960
systems

870
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
is further out than they think it is

871
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,399
and you know it's like we still don't

872
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,679
you know there's no reason

873
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,640
for physics or engineering why we can't

874
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,919
have fusion power

875
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,440
but we don't because it's hard real hard

876
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,519
and i and i think that quantum computing

877
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,320
is going to be

878
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
a lot harder than that i think that

879
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
there's going to be a lot of problems

880
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,919
that quantum computing

881
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,039
can help with before it gets to

882
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,440
the things that normally get done

883
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,360
you know it's always oh quantum theater

884
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,919
is going to break all the cryptography

885
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,080
but a quantum computer that can do

886
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,640
certain sorts of memory organization or

887
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
quantum information science where you

888
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,240
can do

889
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,360
things like have an ultra fast

890
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,000
clock and an ultra fast clock is a

891
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,519
gravitometer

892
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,120
you know because clocks you know it's

893
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,720
einstein clocks slowed down

894
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,159
and if you can use a clock as a

895
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,279
gravitometer

896
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,000
that will permit us to do things like a

897
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,559
lot

898
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
of of changing the way that we

899
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,000
interact with the environment where

900
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
we'll have tools that we never had

901
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,799
before and i think that

902
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,320
those are going to be coming before we

903
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
have quantum computing that well they

904
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,919
can break cryptography they think that

905
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:02,960
there's going to be

906
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,200
a lot of uses for quantum cryptography

907
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,399
that are not that

908
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,879
that were that we are only five to ten

909
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,320
year

910
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,040
verge of they're just not going to be

911
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,969
the sexy thing

912
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,960
[Laughter]

913
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,879
all right i think we i think we run out

914
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,159
of time right yeah we've

915
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,879
we've got thanks so much we've asked you

916
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,879
more questions than we intended to and

917
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:25,359
like i

918
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,839
think like yeah uh we don't have any

919
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:28,719
more questions on this

920
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,760
video right now well that's that's great

921
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,399
i mean i've had a great time you know

922
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,199
i'm sorry

923
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
that we're not in amsterdam and can't go

924
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,399
out for a beer to you now

925
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,719
um hopefully you know we'll we'll do

926
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,159
that later

927
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,918
and um i don't mind staying up to three

928
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,280
in the morning once in a while i'm a

929
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
night owl

930
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,599
uh so bro we really hope that we can see

931
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
you again uh in person

932
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,680
um as soon as possible already i mean

933
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,280
i'm really hoping that we'll be able to

934
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,640
travel as soon as we have our

935
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,160
password vaccination things right like

936
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,839
that we're waiting for the digital cert

937
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,040
that comes with it

938
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,960
and then hopefully we'll be able to meet

939
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
up somewhere at least

940
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
if not this year then definitely next

941
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,359
year thanks a lot again for i think

942
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,000
there's

943
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,640
good chance for next year definitely the

944
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,160
one after that

945
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,040
so thank you so much it's been an

946
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,599
absolute delight to be here

947
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,960
likewise it's been really great happy

948
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,800
humans thanks so much for taking the

949
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,839
time and uh
