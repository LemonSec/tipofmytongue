1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
thanks for inviting me to this

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,920
uh ask me anything conversation

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
no of course no and that's why it's

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,560
going to be fun

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,439
right so exactly exactly we'll we will

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,880
start with something easy first okay

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
we'll start with the easy ones first

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
also i love the fact that when we when

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
we talk about security stuff we

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
kind of grow into philosophical issues

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,160
uh which are really my thing so i really

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
look forward our conversation today

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,840
okay we'll try and like start off with

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
some easy ones first okay bro

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
uh maybe you guys what you might want to

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
tell the audience a little bit about

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,360
uh what have you guys been up to for the

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,079
last one year because um i'm guessing

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,480
for most people staying at home their

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,440
jobs have changed

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
entire world has changed like nobody's

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,280
flying anywhere anymore

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
and so what's new with you know with the

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,640
bounty stuff man i mean

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,240
how hard you guys been adapting to that

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
and how is it well

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
well uh this is an interesting question

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
because it's a it's a mixed

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
bag you know um the pandemic

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
on one hand created a lot of issues

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
especially logistic issues

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,960
we couldn't travel we couldn't meet in

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,920
person we couldn't see people

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
attend to events sponsor events

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
and then go and you know

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
have a face-to-face

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,680
relationship with people which in our

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,320
field

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
is extremely important but

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,759
and you know it is better than anyone

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,719
because

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,600
you're organized one of the of the best

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,240
events

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,439
uh worldwide um but

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,040
on the other hand people adapted very

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
quickly

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,038
to the new uh work from home

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,680
stuff especially in our field where

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
basically that's what people do anyway

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
so i would say that

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
apart from the pleasure of meeting

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
people in person

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
that sometimes also helps to create

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,790
stronger relationships

55
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,400
[Music]

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
the business for us worked

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
as usual and honestly

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
i must say that we had more time

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,959
uh and therefore we could focus on more

60
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,080
things and we did

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
more things last year than in the

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
previous year

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,239
so as i said it's a mixed bag this as

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,720
you said

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
the world has changed and probably this

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
change at least to a certain degree

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,959
would be

68
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
would be permanent it's difficult to

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
think that we will

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,599
go back exactly to where we were

71
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,799
one year and a half ago

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
but for us it was not such a big trauma

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
you know not only that but by

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
freeing up time and resources

75
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
uh we could focus also on

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
something new or something different so

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
we took the chance

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
to you know uh think better

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
because we were less in a hurry less

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,640
you know jumping from here and there

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,599
from one plane to another and so on so

82
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,360
for me uh and this is of course just my

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
personal experience of this of this

84
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,319
tragedy which is

85
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
and was the pandemic for me in the end

86
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,879
it was a time for thinking better

87
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,920
and to plan and to

88
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,840
do more so that's fine

89
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
i mean with when it comes to bug hunting

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,519
though right like i mean in the past

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,280
i would guess that you would go and

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
physically see the

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
the bug hunter right at night you would

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
probably get

95
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,439
some kind of like face-to-face

96
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
discussion with them or how is that

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
changed i mean i we're talking about you

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,358
know kind of expensive

99
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,800
code right they're worth quite a lot if

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,840
you are talking about zero yeah

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
absolutely

102
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
absolutely absolutely but since this

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
was something that didn't happen only to

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
us but happened to

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
everybody in the world at the same time

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
so psychologically speaking

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
at first everyone was was taken off

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,120
guard

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
by this problem and then with the

110
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
different speeds people managed to find

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
a

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
compromise or new approach to

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
things um i must say that

114
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
i think we were very quick to adapt also

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,520
because we are used to

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,840
work with researchers through our

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,639
platform

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,160
the so-called brh vulnerability research

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
up therefore of course

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
it's nicer sometimes to meet people in

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,479
person but

122
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
some other times they don't even want to

123
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,680
meet

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
so everything happens through the

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
platform or through

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
online channels anywhere so right so

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
in your case i mean with uh much

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,000
different

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
because you have the platform right so

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,840
what is

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
sorry i couldn't hear you can you say oh

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,560
no i'm saying that the with crop fans

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,759
right like so the fact that you guys

134
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,800
have your

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,919
vulnerability platform that makes a big

136
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,199
difference right because all of the

137
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,560
communications can take place through

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,880
the platform which is secure

139
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,400
so it didn't need to have okay so

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,080
in my dreams in my dreams it's like that

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
in fact it doesn't happen some people

142
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
prefer to

143
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
contact us through other means

144
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,600
so we receive uh you know nuclear grade

145
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
proposals for for assets on whatsapp

146
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
and this is of course wrong

147
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,039
or basically should be avoided so

148
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,199
in our vision

149
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,720
the rear age is safe enough so that

150
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
even if at the beginning at the early

151
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
stages of a negotiation

152
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,039
the part the researcher can be anonymous

153
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,840
and this anonymity is strongly enforced

154
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
by the platform

155
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,639
then if we go into a deeper conversation

156
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
and we find interested parties for

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
acquiring that asset then of course we

158
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
will need to

159
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,960
to grow each other better

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
if this happens to the platform this

161
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,639
happens in a relatively

162
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
safe environment and i'm saying

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,120
relatively because of course nobody is

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
100 secure

165
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,440
nowadays but we think it has a

166
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,199
good enough level of security anonymity

167
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,610
encryption and so on um

168
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,160
[Music]

169
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
when the contacts come from other

170
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
channels we try to bring them to the vr

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,360
age

172
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,759
and sometimes we succeed sometimes we

173
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,080
don't

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
of course we cannot force people to talk

175
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,240
with us only through the real age that

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
would be

177
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
wrong because of course we respect

178
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
everybody's needs and and

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
and you know approaches

180
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
to opsec and to security

181
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,879
uh but yes having the platform for us

182
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,080
is a big advantage and especially during

183
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,479
this

184
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
past year and a half

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,039
basically we had the same number of

186
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
submissions as the previous years

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
now this is super interesting because

188
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
you know if you go to uh

189
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
hagen box amsterdam and you offer

190
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,840
a super cool party and 500 people attend

191
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
and then they see you know the logo they

192
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
see the brand

193
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
they see you blog so maybe they would be

194
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,799
attracted by by working or collaborating

195
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,360
with us

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
and maybe they will subscribe to the

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
viewer age and submit

198
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
their research this is how it worked

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
before

200
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
now without being able to do these

201
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,200
school parties

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
unfortunately or to be in person

203
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
in these events

204
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,600
more or less we receive the same number

205
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
of submissions

206
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
because of course of course people there

207
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
working from home people

208
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
also researchers had a lot of time

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
because they were in lockdown or they

210
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
couldn't go out and start so

211
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,760
i don't know it's uh for us really uh

212
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
i understand that we are in a very niche

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,760
very vertical and small

214
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
field and that for the majority of

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
others the

216
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
impact of this terrible

217
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
health issue uh global health issue was

218
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,519
was

219
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
was very bad in our case

220
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
we were already working from home we

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
were already working remotely we were

222
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,240
already

223
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
using the best possible tools

224
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
to connect and discuss and negotiate

225
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
very sensitive things uh

226
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
so it wasn't such a big deal

227
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
of course everything has changed i agree

228
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
with you that

229
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
uh this is a huge huge blow

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
to the previous uh state of things to

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
the previous um

232
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,959
world so to speak the simple fact that

233
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
now we are having this conversation

234
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
on zoom instead that having it face to

235
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,200
face

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
in a nice venue is also a consequence of

237
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,519
that right but still we want to do it

238
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
and so we

239
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,200
with enough resilience and

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
you know enough

241
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,519
creativity we can overcome anything

242
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,560
especially in our fear

243
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,480
well hackers right

244
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
what do you think i mean for you it was

245
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,160
uh

246
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
definitely a different story right uh

247
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
but um yes i think that we managed to

248
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
find a to adjust

249
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,200
and then we will see what happens in the

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
next months i'm confident that things

251
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
will go back to normal but

252
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
the normal would be different from

253
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,760
before

254
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,519
[Music]

255
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,440
and so just coming back to like talking

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
about bugs right and bug hunting in

257
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,320
general right

258
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
i would say that things have kind of

259
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
like evolved wouldn't you say that in

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,480
the

261
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
earlier days right it'd be a one guy

262
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,519
could probably find

263
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,079
a significant exploit but maybe today

264
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,279
that's no longer the case because

265
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,880
there's so many defense mechanisms in

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,600
place that

267
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
one person can't fuss everything under

268
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,640
the sun right

269
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,160
absolutely yes you see what's happening

270
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,720
is that

271
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
this market is now differentiating

272
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,120
uh depending on the class

273
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
of target that we are talking about

274
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,760
so while before there were uh

275
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,680
so-called low-hanging fruits everywhere

276
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,440
so you could find them in mobile devices

277
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
in desktop pcs server

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,839
computers and also in networking gear

279
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,000
everywhere

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,160
it was more or less the same level of

281
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,760
insecurity but now we have to deal with

282
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,920
a world where certain classes of devices

283
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
uh so i in impressive

284
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
increase of their uh security

285
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,240
in the past two years three years

286
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,000
uh because the vendors finally

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,120
and and i say finally even if apparently

288
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
it's against my my own interest but

289
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,360
if i look at the interests of

290
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
society as a whole if security increases

291
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
is a good thing so i say

292
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
i always say that luckily now

293
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,279
some classes of targets at least some of

294
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,320
them

295
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
are much more difficult to to exploit

296
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
successfully and in a

297
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,120
meaningful way in an actionable way

298
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,839
but other classes of targets are still

299
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
lagging behind

300
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,839
and i'm talking about all this that

301
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,120
crap iot staff scada

302
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
a lot of

303
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,240
small home small office home office

304
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,279
networking gear

305
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,720
you know i ip cameras oh

306
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,519
there's a uni universe of broken objects

307
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,320
everywhere and this is getting worse

308
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,079
so while a few classes of targets

309
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,600
improve their security significantly

310
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
to a point where it's hard for a single

311
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
researcher to find

312
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,450
actionable

313
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,199
[Music]

314
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,000
exploits bugs and then to exploit them

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
in an actionable way

316
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
i mean we know there are a few geniuses

317
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,519
out there

318
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,839
but they are the exception they are not

319
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,279
the the normal

320
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,760
for the majority of people is becoming

321
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
extremely

322
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
complicated in terms of

323
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,880
knowledge required skills time

324
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,160
resources including financial resources

325
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
and so on but on many other classes of

326
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
targets the situation is still

327
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
the the security posture of these

328
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,240
devices is still uh terrible

329
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
and so what we see is that the the

330
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
interest is shifting

331
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
from those device who are very very

332
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,279
difficult to hack

333
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,839
and to exploit nowadays to the others

334
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,040
because in the end from the point of

335
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,519
view of an attacker

336
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,279
the the attack surface is a very complex

337
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,880
and huge surface that includes a lot of

338
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,760
things

339
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,199
so if an attacker cannot get your phone

340
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,120
they will get your

341
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,760
uh thermostat they will get your wi-fi

342
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,800
they will get your car they will get

343
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
your

344
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
um you know internet connected

345
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,680
uh scale that will publish on facebook

346
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,480
your weight

347
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,000
every day and so we are uh

348
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,160
we are really um

349
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
overwhelmed but the amount of crap that

350
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
surrounds

351
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,279
uh i mean in terms of

352
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,000
digital crap that surrounds us so are

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
you actually seeing

354
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,759
an uptick in uh exploit writers focusing

355
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
more on two embedded and iot and also

356
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,079
buyers as in are there enough buyers to

357
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,720
to justify the researcher changing their

358
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
focus as in like instead of looking at

359
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
mobile like look at the embedded space

360
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
or look at scada because

361
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
the uh

362
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
i must give you an answer which has two

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,199
parts

364
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
the first answer the first part is since

365
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,959
we don't

366
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,720
deal on purpose with the

367
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,759
development of cyber weapons

368
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,720
but we only deal with the law

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,519
enforcement

370
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
and intelligence side of things and

371
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,839
when i say intelligence i mean

372
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,480
intelligence

373
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,320
gathering not sabotage for example

374
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
so since we are not dealing with cyber

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
weapons

376
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,040
most of this stuff that is being offered

377
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,199
on the market nowadays which relates to

378
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,560
scada iot

379
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
and this kind of crappy products

380
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
is not in scope with our

381
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,800
customers needs so we don't

382
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,439
really look into that i mean we keep

383
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:05,919
track

384
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,359
of things but we don't deal with those

385
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,119
kind of things

386
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,160
but since iot and

387
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
networking and scada systems can have

388
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,000
many different

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
applications and many different shapes

390
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,480
and and can

391
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
also be part of an attack surface for an

392
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,160
intelligence

393
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,280
activity sometimes

394
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
uh there is a

395
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
not no let me say not sometimes there is

396
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,679
a growing

397
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
interest in some of these devices

398
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,400
or classes of devices because

399
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
they can be used on the field to reach

400
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
certain goals so to answer your question

401
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
there is not enough demand at least

402
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
in our field from for

403
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
iot and scada research

404
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
but sometimes we have a very interesting

405
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,320
request

406
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,080
for very specific things so um

407
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,480
even uh recently we were dealing with um

408
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,120
some amazing research in this field

409
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,640
and and we found some interest from

410
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
from the from the demand side

411
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,679
from from the buyers uh

412
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
but generally speaking i think this is

413
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
something that will develop

414
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,480
more and more in the next years

415
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
so this shift will happen in the next

416
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
two or three years

417
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
when the mobile

418
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,880
would be so difficult to to exploit that

419
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
it will become a liability and therefore

420
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,039
it will

421
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,400
lose its attractive

422
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,000
attractiveness its interest

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
so now we are like at the early stages

424
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,080
of this uh

425
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
shift so but if i understood correctly

426
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,039
your question

427
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
is the thing is

428
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
how can we support these researchers

429
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
which are following their interests

430
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,160
and researching things that are not

431
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,760
so interesting or so in demand well

432
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
of course they can do this as a bug

433
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,320
bounty they can

434
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,080
refer and disclose these bugs to vendors

435
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
and they or they can go to events and

436
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,080
they can

437
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,440
get a prize for disclosing a nasty

438
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,480
bug on a iot device

439
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
there's so many things that they can do

440
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
uh if they have something

441
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,440
that they consider interesting they can

442
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,559
still talk to us

443
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,799
and we will tell them very honestly look

444
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,039
this is something that

445
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,000
doesn't fit with uh

446
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,400
[Music]

447
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,360
with with our customer needs or this is

448
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,159
something that

449
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
might be interesting and then we can we

450
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
can

451
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,770
go deeper and

452
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,280
[Music]

453
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,120
and see what what what is possible

454
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,200
so let's just make a hypothetical

455
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
situation okay let's just say i'm the

456
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,919
bug hunter right

457
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,240
how much of the exploit do i need to

458
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,320
disclose

459
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
in order to get the discussion going

460
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,919
because if i tell you too much

461
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,360
you could reproduce it and that's always

462
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
always a fear right it's like i don't

463
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,720
want to tell you like too much yes

464
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,600
well there are different approaches on

465
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,158
the market

466
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,880
someone is asking to see the code period

467
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
and because of trust or because they

468
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,080
have a

469
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,000
very powerful leverage on the researcher

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
so they will say if you want to work

471
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
with us

472
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,840
send us the code and we will let you

473
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,360
know

474
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,320
the way we are doing things is a little

475
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
bit different

476
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
so basically before we go

477
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,799
into the analysis

478
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,000
and testing of any code

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,600
we want to discuss the features

480
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
the coverage the artifacts

481
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,840
the corner cases and the

482
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,000
affected versions and subversions

483
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,919
the possible use cases and so on and so

484
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,559
on

485
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,679
and so on without

486
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,039
having a complete

487
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,159
description of the bug uh

488
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,640
also because it's not in our interest to

489
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,440
steal

490
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,400
the bags from uh researchers you know

491
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
sure it's not oh

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,039
i mean it would be bad

493
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,000
in many ways uh first of all and this is

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,679
obvious this would be bad for our

495
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,640
reputation but it would also be bad

496
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
because then we would put

497
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,840
we would need to put a lot of effort

498
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,159
into

499
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
weaponizing a bug and that's not what

500
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
we do so

501
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
it's not really useful

502
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
for us i'm not talking about the ethical

503
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,720
side of things but of course this is uh

504
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
i give it for so so keep for for granted

505
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,720
um so we discuss up to a point where we

506
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
can understand if

507
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
going further in the negotiation is

508
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,240
useful

509
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,080
or not because many times you know

510
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,200
uh the submission is super cool and you

511
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
think oh wow this is a nice

512
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
asset and then when you go deeper you

513
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,200
discover that

514
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
it only works on friday

515
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
you know it only works when you have a

516
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,400
full moon

517
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
and and you know because that's

518
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,640
how it works this is voodoo uh this is

519
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,360
uh really

520
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
black magic stuff so when you

521
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,960
start to understand that there are too

522
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,159
many

523
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,440
exceptions or situations or problems

524
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,600
from our point of view this is already

525
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,000
a no-go because the application of this

526
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,480
stuff

527
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,159
is so sensitive that you cannot have a

528
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
low reliability or very small coverage

529
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
or artifacts or

530
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
any other issue so

531
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,960
as i also said in my concept track

532
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
talk where where i show the

533
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,159
funnel of our

534
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
let's say the filter that we apply on

535
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,919
all the submissions that we receive

536
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,760
and this slide shows that

537
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,880
over 100 submissions on

538
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,520
average five end up on the field

539
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,799
so it's incredibly steep

540
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,440
uh funnel so and we don't need

541
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,520
to know about the details of the bug

542
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,360
unless there is a clear decision to

543
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
acquire that asset and at that point

544
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,559
since we offer we think that we are

545
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,120
offering

546
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,720
fair contracts we offer

547
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,440
usually unless there is already a good

548
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,320
relationship

549
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,480
with the developer we offer

550
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
advanced payment to see the code

551
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,080
and then we test it and then

552
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
if all the tests are successful

553
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,919
we will finalize the contract

554
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,039
and at that point there will be a

555
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
certain way of paying

556
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,440
which depends on the negotiation so

557
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
in any case when we reach this

558
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
conclusion that this asset is

559
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,799
extremely valuable and interesting and

560
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,080
fits all our

561
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
requirements then at that point is

562
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,559
basically almost done

563
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,400
so we can afford to give

564
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
an advanced payment to see the code

565
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,880
so that the researcher knows that we

566
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,760
are committing ourselves to uh

567
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,720
successful

568
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,279
uh to closing successfully the deal

569
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,559
and then we test we discuss we see if

570
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,600
there are problems

571
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,799
and so on and so on until we finish the

572
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,279
test

573
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,400
and approve in such a case then

574
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
we sign and and everything

575
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
then moves from there

576
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,799
very smoothly so um

577
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,520
people don't have to disclose their bags

578
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,919
and

579
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,320
for those researchers who are listening

580
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,760
now i

581
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,360
advise you to not show your stuff

582
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
to anyone uh because

583
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,400
we see many times that maybe we receive

584
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
the same submission from different sides

585
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,360
and and the original researcher is just

586
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,960
one of them so be careful guys

587
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
don't show your stuff around don't brag

588
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
about it

589
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
with your friends and colleagues

590
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
uh be careful because if you have

591
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,120
something

592
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,880
valuable you don't want to to lick it

593
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
and you don't want to lose control over

594
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,919
it

595
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,880
what about a window of exploitability so

596
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
let's just say if i found a bug

597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
like do i have to guarantee that it's

598
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
going to remain exploitable after you

599
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
guys have done your

600
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
evaluation because what happens if the

601
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,279
vendor patches it do i

602
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,000
still get paid or tough luck of course

603
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,399
but

604
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,600
this is of course so during the tests

605
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
basically let me let me use a metaphor

606
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,799
it's like we are buying uh vegetables

607
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,799
okay but with fresh vegetables without

608
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,960
having a fridge okay so the lifespan of

609
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,840
these things

610
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,159
is by nature unpredictable and usually

611
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
short okay then there are some ways that

612
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,640
we apply

613
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,480
to make them live longer this is part of

614
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,440
our

615
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
i would say risk management

616
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,159
and portfolio management activities

617
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,080
and in the end it works we can say that

618
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,140
by using this

619
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,679
[Music]

620
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,360
this way of doing things we can extend

621
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,480
the lifespan

622
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
the shelf life of this of these

623
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,200
vegetables

624
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
a little bit longer okay but still we're

625
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,200
talking about something that

626
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,120
is ephemeral by by nature

627
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
so if it is patch while we are

628
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,880
discussing

629
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
and or testing then

630
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
in the in the worst case for us the

631
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,600
developer

632
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,080
will will have received the advanced

633
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,919
payment for seeing the code and testing

634
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,240
it

635
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,840
and that's it i mean unless

636
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,919
someone the from the customer side is

637
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
interested in a and a

638
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,120
version of the same but of course the

639
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
price will change and

640
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
many things will be different the the

641
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,679
possibility to effectively

642
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,399
deploy the asset on the field will be

643
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,640
reduced and so on

644
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,399
also it will be less stealth because

645
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,720
it's an end day so it is known and

646
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
therefore for many reasons that

647
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,760
the fields of application of this asset

648
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,399
will be

649
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,960
uh dramatically reduced and therefore

650
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
also the

651
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,200
value will be will be much less

652
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
but maybe it is still possible to close

653
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,559
the view

654
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,399
in many cases it's not uh

655
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,720
to give you an example let's say we're

656
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,919
talking about uh

657
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,960
rc for a major browser

658
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,720
if it's patched and that thing is

659
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
updated automatically

660
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,000
after one week it is completely useful

661
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,279
useless so in that case there is no

662
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,919
even the chance to use it as a name day

663
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,279
and therefore it's gone but uh other

664
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,840
things

665
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
which have a long patching um

666
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
windows or maybe the patch is released

667
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,640
and people don't apply it for some

668
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,919
reason

669
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,399
now for those things there is still hope

670
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,840
so to speak

671
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,320
now what happens if it is patched the

672
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,039
detect

673
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,440
the day after we buy then

674
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
we are uh we are screwed basically

675
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,000
i mean it is our it's our business right

676
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,480
it is

677
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,039
these are the risks that we that we have

678
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,240
to take

679
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
so if this happens

680
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,919
what can we do what can you do like

681
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,679
there's nothing we can do of course we

682
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,559
will not

683
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,200
you know in this case some people would

684
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,080
scramble

685
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,519
to sell it on you know in the in the

686
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,279
dark alleys uh to uh recover

687
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,320
at least some money

688
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,760
uh but that's not what we do we don't

689
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,120
do that so in that case it's a loss

690
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,679
it's a loss it's a loss for both sides

691
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,399
unfortunately

692
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,720
the researcher would have been paid for

693
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,399
the

694
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,240
advanced payment that we paid for for

695
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
reviewing the testing the goal

696
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
and we would have lost that and

697
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,159
we will not and but if we sign already

698
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,720
he will be paid of course

699
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,559
how often in the past has that happened

700
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
as in that uh you know one day after you

701
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
guys all okay maybe not one day but a

702
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
couple of days after you guys have

703
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,559
acquired the

704
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,200
no no it never happened exploit actually

705
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
fortunately

706
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
fortunately it never happened like that

707
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,480
maybe sometimes a very nice asset

708
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,080
had a shorter life than that

709
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,440
what we expected maybe after one month

710
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,720
it was gone okay and but

711
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
you have to consider one thing that this

712
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,919
government organizations which are

713
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,000
uh deploying this this

714
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,519
assets integrated into platforms

715
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,000
usually um they're not

716
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,519
usually fast enough so a one month

717
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,679
window would be extremely good if

718
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
the asset would be deployed the next day

719
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,279
but honestly this is not how it works

720
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,480
maybe

721
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
they will it will take them two weeks or

722
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,559
three weeks to put

723
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,600
it to integrate and

724
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,640
put it in the in the

725
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,679
right condition to be deployed therefore

726
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,679
sometimes

727
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,279
the window of practical

728
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,919
usefulness of these things is reduced

729
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,399
because after we finish our part of the

730
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,480
job

731
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,480
it's not finished there's still some

732
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,919
steps uh before it is uh

733
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,440
used and these take time so

734
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
basically we try to move as fast as

735
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,279
possible

736
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,399
also because of this um

737
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,799
inevitable situation where when

738
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,399
something is ready

739
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,600
it still takes uh one week two weeks

740
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,919
three weeks before it can be

741
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,679
um it can be deployed

742
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,480
so but luckily it never happened like

743
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,799
the next day

744
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,679
that would be that would be really uh

745
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,559
unfortunate

746
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,960
so until now it needs to never happen

747
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,039
but some other times they get never

748
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,200
patched

749
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,870
so another thing that i showed in the

750
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,600
[Music]

751
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,120
in the comsack talk

752
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,879
is some statistics from our 2019

753
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,440
catalog of course i i cannot

754
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,119
show the latest data the latest numbers

755
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,040
but i can't give as an example

756
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
uh some statistics about our 2019

757
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,918
catalog

758
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:32,960
okay after at the end of the year

759
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,199
of the 125

760
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,679
intelligence grade exploits that we

761
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,800
dealt with

762
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,239
during 2019 93

763
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,520
were steals your day oh okay scary

764
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,918
so we are basically saying that for one

765
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,199
one reason or another

766
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:55,570
uh

767
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,320
[Music]

768
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,960
most of these assets have a quite uh

769
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,240
significant

770
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,879
shelf life

771
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,640
[Music]

772
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,760
so and this is at the same time good and

773
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
bad

774
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,280
because it's good because the return on

775
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,520
investment from the customer side is

776
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,440
extremely high

777
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,640
and it's bad because

778
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,640
these customers will not stockpile

779
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,720
uh or at least they don't do it anymore

780
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,480
they used to do it at the

781
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,440
in the early days but now they don't

782
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,839
stop

783
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,359
by assets so if they have one or two

784
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,200
chains that work they will not ask for

785
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,680
more

786
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,640
it would be a waste of money so

787
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,850
[Music]

788
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,680
again this is also a opportunity

789
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,880
and a problem but

790
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,119
in the end i'm convinced that to help

791
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,560
to manage these assets properly

792
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,119
and by doing this extending their shelf

793
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,599
life

794
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,440
as much as possible is a good

795
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,800
plus of our approach

796
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,000
of our services

797
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
and of course also the fact that we sell

798
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,839
to very few

799
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,560
selected customers we don't sell to

800
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
anyone

801
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,599
we can sell to large numbers of

802
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,960
customers

803
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
which also helps to you know

804
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,720
protect the investments made by

805
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,119
our customers would you say that of the

806
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,960
customers that are that are purchasing

807
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,079
these assets right

808
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,760
uh are most of them using it for

809
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,680
offensive capability or are they trying

810
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,000
to

811
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
derive some defensive understanding from

812
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
it as well

813
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,600
well first of all i mean

814
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,360
[Laughter]

815
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,119
we have some idea of the field of

816
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,720
application but we don't know

817
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,359
so the vetting that we do is on the

818
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:08,000
customer

819
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,960
is not on the activity that the customer

820
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,599
will perform because

821
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,320
of course we are not in the position to

822
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,620
know

823
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,599
[Music]

824
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,680
but this said sometimes we receive

825
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,200
different types of requests

826
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,359
this is also very interesting and this

827
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
is also

828
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,280
why i'm thinking that some kind of

829
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
convergence between

830
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,560
offensive and defensive activities

831
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,680
is needed

832
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,640
so sometimes we receive as a request we

833
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,480
want to know

834
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,520
if our tanks are vulnerable

835
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,119
to this okay now i'm saying thanks

836
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,599
it's just an example it's not maybe

837
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,800
thanks but

838
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,040
to give you an idea or we want to know

839
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,480
if our telco

840
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,680
or we want to know if so

841
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,640
in this case the

842
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,800
the the exploit is used to prepare

843
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,420
counter measures or mitigations

844
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,599
[Music]

845
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
again we don't know exactly how and when

846
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
but

847
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,359
this is certainly the idea behind

848
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,960
certain purchases in other cases it is

849
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
clearly for offensive purposes

850
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,119
also some things are offensive

851
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,560
by nature i mean there's no way to use

852
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,880
them for defensive spots

853
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,520
so uh yeah but i would say that

854
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,680
we have both uh types of requests

855
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,799
depending on

856
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
things that we

857
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,520
can only imagine that we don't know but

858
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,839
you know

859
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,920
you know the the fact that sometimes

860
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,160
you can also find collisions you can

861
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,440
find the same bug

862
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,320
twice so sometimes

863
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,880
what happens is that there is a an

864
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,920
attack

865
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,720
and they want to understand how it was

866
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,839
done

867
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,560
and by researching

868
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,320
the same class of bugs we can give them

869
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,200
some

870
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,680
hints or maybe find the game the same

871
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
bug that was already used

872
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,359
against them because honestly

873
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,839
and i always say our visibility on this

874
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:48,320
market

875
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
is not 100 so

876
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,000
at this point after five years we are in

877
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,359
a position to see

878
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,359
a lot of what's going on but not

879
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,160
everything so

880
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,079
sometimes maybe someone has already

881
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,560
found

882
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
the same bug and exploited it and and we

883
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
just don't know

884
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
especially those teams that work

885
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,520
exclusively

886
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,800
for a certain customer and you will

887
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,119
never know what they have

888
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,960
unless you find it

889
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,119
in your uh your

890
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
in your networking uh

891
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,920
uh locks okay however you find it

892
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,839
uh do you find that it was used against

893
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,839
you so

894
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,640
mostly the requests that we receive are

895
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,319
for

896
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,800
purely offensive stuff and again as i

897
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,280
said previously

898
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,440
very focused on the information

899
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,319
gathering

900
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,920
and for law enforcement and

901
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,040
and for intelligence

902
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,880
so you know i mean i think one of the

903
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,359
questions that uh normally comes up when

904
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,000
it comes to

905
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
bounty programs is ethics and the trust

906
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,480
side of things right so you guys know

907
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,640
who your buyers are but what's stopping

908
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,280
them from reselling it

909
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,400
well that's a very good question that's

910
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,720
my answer is very simple we don't work

911
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
with integrators

912
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
[Music]

913
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,240
which is a big loss

914
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
in terms of potential business but it's

915
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,520
also the only way

916
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
to make sure that our assets go

917
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,440
exactly where we want them to go

918
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
you see it would be much easier

919
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,839
to sell to integrators there are a

920
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,160
very interesting

921
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,040
companies nowadays which are developing

922
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,440
uh

923
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
platforms and tools and that could

924
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
integrate our assets

925
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,800
into their let's call it armory

926
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,480
okay uh or set off

927
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
uh assets but

928
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,480
uh of course we cannot force them to

929
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,200
disclose

930
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,720
who their customers are and

931
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,760
therefore we cannot uh

932
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,040
risk that for some reason something that

933
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,359
we

934
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,880
uh developed or that we found and then

935
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,839
maybe a big package

936
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,319
fine-tuned extended and so on because

937
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,319
this is what people did

938
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,520
also because and i hope the researchers

939
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,359
will not be offended

940
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,640
uh a very good researcher often

941
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,119
is not all also a very good program

942
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,040
so sometimes the the exploits are super

943
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,000
cool but

944
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,760
can be um significantly improved from a

945
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
programming point of view

946
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,319
so we invest a lot and therefore we

947
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,200
cannot risk

948
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
that our assets go

949
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,520
in places that we don't want them to go

950
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,720
or simply to not know where they go

951
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,280
without any judgment you know on on the

952
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,079
fact that

953
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,640
these companies have customers from all

954
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,839
over the world and not all countries are

955
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,200
giving the same level of

956
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
assurance about how they will use

957
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,280
these assets for many reasons that we

958
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,079
don't

959
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,160
want to judge it's just a matter of

960
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,280
facts

961
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,400
so yes that's my answer

962
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,359
it's very simple we know where these

963
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
assets go because we don't deal with

964
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,040
intermediaries or we don't deal with

965
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,839
integrators

966
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,520
so from the risk management side of

967
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
things basically you guys have

968
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,440
processes in place in order to make sure

969
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,280
that there's some level of guarantee i

970
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
guess to the expert writer that

971
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,040
that tool isn't going to fall into

972
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
unquote wrong hands you know there's

973
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,960
always that concern right

974
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,800
you see this discussion this topic about

975
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,599
what which are the right hands and the

976
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,560
wrong hands is

977
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,079
super complicated yeah and uh really we

978
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,119
would need a

979
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,839
couple of uh weekends to discuss about

980
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,280
it

981
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,960
with a good bottle of wine because uh

982
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,560
it's really complicated um it's not so

983
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,440
easy as many people think it is

984
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,800
so we need to remove as much as possible

985
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,119
the risks of exposure or liabilities or

986
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,040
incidents or abuses

987
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,280
to the maximum degree possible

988
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,119
of course if you are selling

989
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,480
sidearms to the police

990
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,400
you sell them uh 50 000 beretta

991
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,440
results and if there is one crazy

992
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,240
policeman

993
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,280
that is going to uh kill an

994
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,520
innocent with that director

995
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,359
how can you prevent it so even if maybe

996
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,839
the law enforcement agency overall

997
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,839
behaves properly followed or follows the

998
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,079
rules

999
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,319
and is abiding to to the laws

1000
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,279
you can still have

1001
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,240
individuals which create problems and

1002
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,839
this is something that is

1003
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,359
unavoidable but this said

1004
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,240
you can choose to sell to a certain law

1005
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,680
enforcement agency

1006
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,119
and not to another your

1007
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,400
your your pistols now

1008
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
i don't like to assimilate exploits to

1009
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,160
guns

1010
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,359
because this is uh

1011
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,800
simply not right it's not a useful

1012
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,640
metaphor exploits are not equivalent of

1013
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,280
guns

1014
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,240
in the cyberspace blah blah this is crap

1015
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,880
exploits are pieces of software that do

1016
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,400
very specific things

1017
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,480
on a very very few specific targets

1018
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,319
for a very short time until they

1019
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,800
don't work anymore so it's completely

1020
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
different from a gun

1021
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,520
but going back to your to your question

1022
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,960
um the the

1023
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,960
risk management is i would say

1024
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,720
50 of our job

1025
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,000
we are both doing very technical

1026
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,599
weird things

1027
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,599
and applying

1028
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,440
very strict risk management

1029
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,880
processes from management

1030
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,280
and organizational point of view also

1031
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,079
because there are no

1032
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,160
good regulations in place so

1033
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,880
imagine if you are shipping a can of

1034
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
very toxic thing uh

1035
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,119
there are so many laws so many checks

1036
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,559
and this shipment will be tracked

1037
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,880
because it's dangerous toxic uh

1038
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,160
stuff and there will be a certain way

1039
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,640
uh which is a standard that must be

1040
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,520
applied to

1041
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,960
handle this can uh to

1042
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,400
move it from here to there and so on so

1043
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,480
but for um exploits there's nothing like

1044
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,520
that

1045
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,960
nobody knows actually that

1046
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,200
the dangerousness of what they are

1047
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,079
dealing with

1048
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,990
until an incident happens

1049
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:09,100
[Music]

1050
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,160
in trying to manage this in some ways so

1051
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,359
that everybody plays

1052
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,839
fairly so we we found a lot of

1053
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,160
resistance

1054
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,680
in in the market to refine

1055
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,759
a new better

1056
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,280
risk assessment standard

1057
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,400
we tried but we didn't receive uh

1058
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
good uh feedbacks from other players

1059
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,160
customers are interested but um

1060
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,280
many uh at least until now

1061
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,760
in the in the market are not interested

1062
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,599
into

1063
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,440
finding defining together a way to give

1064
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,000
a risk score to these things

1065
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,680
and handle them differently depending on

1066
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,440
what they are

1067
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,480
so if you have something with uh and i'm

1068
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,839
talking about the i'm

1069
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,720
not talking about the cvss score of

1070
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,920
course because that is

1071
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,280
purely technical yeah okay but

1072
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,880
you can have a 9 or a 10 for something

1073
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,319
that cannot have huge impacts at the

1074
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,160
society level

1075
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,240
uh while something else with the same

1076
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,760
ccbs

1077
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,960
coss sorry could have dramatic

1078
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,079
impacts on society so

1079
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,920
we are not there yet but we really would

1080
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,839
like to

1081
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,040
move forward in this direction because

1082
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,680
also for us as a company imagine we are

1083
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,520
a small company

1084
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,760
and we are dealing with things that

1085
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,240
potentially can be extremely

1086
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,839
damaging so we take all possible

1087
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,119
measures

1088
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,160
and we really avoid to do a lot

1089
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
of deals because we don't want to

1090
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,720
generate

1091
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,119
unnecessary risks or simply

1092
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,079
to create unpredictable situations where

1093
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,920
we don't know what's going to happen

1094
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,440
that is enough for us to stop a deal

1095
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,480
many others are not following this kind

1096
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,160
of approach

1097
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,280
and and i understand it because since

1098
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,520
there are no regulations why should they

1099
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,240
bother

1100
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,599
right but in perspective

1101
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,920
responsible i don't want to use

1102
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,079
the word ethical because i don't know i

1103
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,599
know many people will

1104
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,670
you know be um

1105
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,520
[Music]

1106
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,559
want to be happy if i if i try to say

1107
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,640
that this is an ethical approach right

1108
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,920
to offensive stuff

1109
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,079
it's it's apparently a paradox

1110
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,960
um so let me just say that from um

1111
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,240
risk management point of view in order

1112
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,359
to make

1113
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,880
things happen smoothly reduce

1114
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,319
liabilities reduce unnecessary risks

1115
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,240
and overall having this market work in a

1116
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,319
sustainable way we should develop

1117
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,400
some sort of standard for attributing

1118
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,760
a risk score to

1119
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,119
different types of different classes

1120
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,520
of assets the fact that we don't have

1121
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,759
this

1122
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,599
is dangerous how long do you think so

1123
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,440
before we see this becoming kind of

1124
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,720
commonplace that everybody kind of

1125
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,240
agrees that we have a standardized way

1126
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,599
of describing it or

1127
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,319
attributing a risk score to it yeah you

1128
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,079
see the thing is this risk score

1129
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,800
is not cannot be purely technical

1130
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,319
because when we're talking about

1131
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,400
cyber stuff nowadays we are talking

1132
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,359
about something that

1133
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,520
affects physical and human

1134
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,359
assets as much as if not more

1135
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,800
technical assets so for example

1136
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,680
let's say you have a nice exploit for uh

1137
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,960
wearable healthcare device

1138
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,720
now from the point of view of research

1139
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,079
this is super cool

1140
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,920
right but if this ends in the wrong

1141
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,280
hands this can be used to kill people

1142
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,400
not just to take their emails

1143
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,599
from their phone and by the way

1144
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,319
also taking emails from the phone can be

1145
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,400
very dangerous

1146
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,839
depending on the situation right so uh

1147
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,480
we need to define a multi-dimensional

1148
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,240
scoring system where the technical

1149
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,920
variables are together with the

1150
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,280
potential impacts

1151
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,400
in terms of several

1152
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,079
things and and this should

1153
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,079
give us some sort of index so that we

1154
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:12,400
know

1155
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,520
what we are dealing with and we can

1156
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,960
we can definitely improve the way we

1157
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,440
work

1158
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,720
if we know what are the risks of

1159
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,400
this stuff of course we have our own

1160
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,079
uh internally developed

1161
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,800
uh risk assessment framework

1162
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,559
because even if there is not a standard

1163
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,160
we wanted to have this

1164
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,480
so everything we deal with has a score

1165
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,200
and i must say from our experience that

1166
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,400
the fact that we developed this

1167
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,160
uh helps us uh a lot

1168
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,280
in in our activities and in taking

1169
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,640
decisions

1170
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,160
uh taking decisions sometimes this will

1171
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,200
go against the business

1172
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,920
this is inevitable like every time there

1173
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,839
is some kind of

1174
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,280
regulation or self-regulation you will

1175
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,520
also lose something but you will gain

1176
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,640
more by saving on

1177
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,000
on mistakes errors consequences

1178
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,119
liabilities

1179
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,040
and and so on so

1180
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
so that's our approach our approach and

1181
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,079
i hope it

1182
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,119
will slowly spread

1183
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,040
in this market because this is something

1184
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,200
that we really

1185
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,880
miss as a community as a whole to know

1186
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,960
more or less what we're talking about in

1187
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,720
terms of

1188
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,960
potential impacts and act accordingly

1189
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,400
uh i would say even responsible if not

1190
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,079
ethically

1191
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,760
okay but yeah i was gonna say like uh

1192
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,520
why don't you guys take the lead as in

1193
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,640
like since you already have the

1194
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,240
framework in place that you guys use

1195
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,920
internally why not publish it publish it

1196
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,520
as an open doc that

1197
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,280
everybody can refer to and then say that

1198
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,040
this is going to be

1199
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,880
like you know what this is this is a

1200
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,400
great

1201
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,359
possibility we have been thinking about

1202
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,119
it and

1203
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,839
this is one possibility but you know i

1204
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,040
would prefer

1205
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,359
to find some sort of preliminary

1206
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,319
agreement

1207
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,359
with some of the biggest

1208
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:35,599
players in this field review this

1209
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,720
together and then after this review

1210
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,079
after this discussion and this uh

1211
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,640
fine-tuning because i'm sure that our

1212
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,319
framework is

1213
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,839
not perfect and then we could

1214
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,920
together share it with the rest of the

1215
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,960
of the community for further refinements

1216
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,119
and for further discussion

1217
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,119
uh this is not something that you know

1218
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,440
because this in the end will be some

1219
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,119
sort of self-regulation

1220
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,880
it has to be embraced

1221
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,280
it cannot be enforced so

1222
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,760
my hope is to find a critical mass

1223
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,319
of interested parties that want to work

1224
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,160
on this and then

1225
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,799
after this preliminary work we can share

1226
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:27,359
it

1227
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,319
for further discussion with the

1228
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,280
community as

1229
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,920
whole and receive all the comments

1230
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
receive all the ideas

1231
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,359
and and and have in the end something

1232
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,319
that was really

1233
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,880
shared and therefore can be applied

1234
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,960
so definitely this is something i want

1235
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,400
to work

1236
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,000
in the next months maybe you could

1237
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,799
also help us to do this yeah for sure i

1238
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:55,760
mean i was just going to say like you

1239
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,880
know if there's any way that you think

1240
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,520
we can

1241
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,599
play a small part in helping to make

1242
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,760
this discussion at least start

1243
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,280
uh we'd be more than happy to you know i

1244
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,799
mean i can think of katie masuris as one

1245
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,640
person that might have a lot of ideas on

1246
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,400
how this can be put into some kind of a

1247
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,520
framework

1248
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,880
that we can at least have a reference

1249
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,079
point to start off from it's not going

1250
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,520
to be perfect but we have to start

1251
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,319
somewhere

1252
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,280
this is just for having some kind of

1253
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,119
reference

1254
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,640
because the fact that we completely

1255
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,000
don't have that considering the size

1256
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,400
of this market the sensitivity of what

1257
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,040
we do

1258
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,400
the applications of what we deal with

1259
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,559
is definitely uh needed

1260
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,520
we can we can't wait anymore it's it's

1261
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,000
about

1262
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,440
time to to have this kind of

1263
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,960
reference at least uh for uh

1264
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,079
for taking informed decisions because

1265
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,760
the zero days are definitely

1266
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,960
not born equal and they will have

1267
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,520
different

1268
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,440
impacts different effects different

1269
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,799
applications

1270
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,920
and potentially different adverse

1271
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,200
effects excellent

1272
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,119
excellent excellent uh i think we're out

1273
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,400
of time brother

1274
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,799
we have already just got past an hour

1275
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,040
but um yeah i know but we can go on for

1276
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,839
another six hours

1277
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,160
it's so interesting no fine so yes i

1278
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:20,480
hope

1279
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,079
i answered uh i mean i tried to answer

1280
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,839
in the most open and transparent way as

1281
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,880
possible and i really thank you for for

1282
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,960
these questions and for this opportunity

1283
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,240
to

1284
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,559
discuss things that are usually not

1285
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,839
discussed openly

1286
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,960
which is a pity yeah i understand the

1287
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,680
need for

1288
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,880
uh confidentiality and of course

1289
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,160
those are required in our field but

1290
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,520
to discuss about the field shouldn't be

1291
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,480
uh double as it is should be the

1292
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,640
conversations should be

1293
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,920
open and a wider audience should also

1294
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,319
contribute

1295
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,680
which is something that we're trying to

1296
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,079
do right so hopefully

1297
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,680
hopefully this is just uh a little

1298
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,880
step towards that direction well let's

1299
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,319
plan for this road let's plan for

1300
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,319
for maybe getting together towards later

1301
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,000
part of the year when things hopefully

1302
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,760
get a little bit better and let's see

1303
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,240
who we can put onto a panel of some sort

1304
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,520
where we can at least start the

1305
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,880
discussion right because like it's not

1306
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,680
like we're going to come up with the

1307
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,799
solution but

1308
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,480
we have to start we have started yeah

1309
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,160
look we don't think we have

1310
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,000
now the solutions we think that we have

1311
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,400
the questions

1312
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,880
at this point yeah we have some ideas of

1313
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,920
course also but

1314
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,319
uh mostly we have questions and we would

1315
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,079
like to find

1316
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,440
the answers excellent excellent

1317
