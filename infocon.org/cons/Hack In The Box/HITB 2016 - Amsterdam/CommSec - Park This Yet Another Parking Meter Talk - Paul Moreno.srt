1
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,820
all right

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,180
computer talk who here likes paying for
parking i know i do so it doesn't seem

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,420
to be a problem here in the netherlands
that you people don't generally have

4
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,840
cars and because it's very expensive and
parking is just another one of those

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,520
things

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,190
ok so am I just give you a quick rundown
a hoop home right now is here

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,120
I'm de mes security engineering lead for
<operand> twenty </operand> out of

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,260
Amsterdam but as you can tell by the
sound of my voice I'm American

9
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,699
originally from the San Francisco Bay
Area i'm on the advisory board for

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,980
bugcrowd which is a bug bounty hosting
platform a lot more than that I wouldn't

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,000
do justice up here and then also a
company called nanosec which is doing

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
application application authentication
authorization

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,940
it's a startup that nobody's heard of
and then formally head of security for

14
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,869
Pinterest which is a school online
scrapbooking site that's very popular in

15
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:19,070
america on bring some momentum out here
and in Europe and then the rest of the

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:25,339
world - I also like satellites projects
mostly art long walks on the beach and

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,770
if you'd like to hear more about my
sound white stuff

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,009
I'd be happy to tell you all about
writing a giant unicorn in the desert

19
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,490
alright so what is this about

20
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,440
it's about the m5 single space parking
meter as you can see right here

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,640
it's very popular in a lot of major us
metropolitan areas

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,970
supposedly it is getting more
international presence

23
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,319
I have yet to see them anywhere outside
the United States but these are the

24
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:57,679
meters you'd see like in san diego san
francisco newark new jersey is Chicago a

25
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,069
lot of other major metropolitan areas so
there again they're all over the place

26
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,360
for seem to pop up everywhere there a
more modern version of the older ones I

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,090
just basically take coins or smart cards

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,220
these ones have a lot more tech behind
them so parking meters and they're not

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,690
new and the security space people have
done a lot of a lot of talks on them

30
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,010
I've actually seen a couple myself a red
and found one online that actually

31
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,420
caught my attention

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,809
there was a gentleman that works for
Raytheon that found a way to strip the

33
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,370
ship heads off

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,959
of a parking meter and read the eeprom
data using an electron microscope and

35
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,610
neural network image processing to
actually get the code off the chip

36
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,540
that was a little bit more on the insane
side and there's a little bit of a blurb

37
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,620
on that one

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,190
yeah that was a to me a kind of us to 10
of 10 when it comes to parking meter

39
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,250
talks but the guy ended up finding code
that was used to exploit the infrared

40
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,159
communication channel on it so it was
able to get free parking out of it that

41
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,048
way kind of nuts

42
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,940
there's also more popular one that was
done at black hack back in 09

43
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,760
which was really the exploitation of the
smart card system because they were not

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,099
really designed with security in mind

45
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:15,798
basically anti fraud protection mine so
they're able to to pull off a smart card

46
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,890
payment acts they got hit with a gag
order

47
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,339
but at the same time I guess the bonuses
they got free parking so all right so to

48
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,000
cover or what I'm going to cover today
is really a little bit about the

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,669
manufacturer which is the IP IP s group
incorporated the hardware which actually

50
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:36,410
have up here today

51
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,630
assembled basically completely
disassembled it for this talk and then

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,560
also done a little bit of my own
research at home here in the netherlands

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,819
on it so i'm going to go over the
capabilities that identified chips and

54
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:52,608
little bits and pieces that I've
discovered on it and then also some

55
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,129
funny business a little couple weird
things here and there that I've

56
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,450
discovered so far

57
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,668
just so you know this this talk is not
meant to bash the IPS group or the

58
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,510
hardware

59
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,298
this is me really doing a teardown I
have yet to find any serious

60
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,470
vulnerabilities with this but that is my
intent at a later date to hopefully find

61
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,750
a little bit something interesting with
this

62
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,570
the hardware or possibly how they manage
it and then again what's next

63
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,570
all right IPS group incorporated

64
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,219
they are based out of sunny San Diego
they've been around since the nineties

65
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,330
which I from what I've discovered really
started as a cellular communications

66
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,530
company which make makes sense with with
this talk a little later here

67
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,390
the private venture back from what I
discovered online using crunchbase and

68
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,229
just news articles that they've got
probably two

69
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,210
- 2.8 million dollars to fund their
business their pc I level one certified

70
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,919
which is a rather difficult level
certification to get in credit card land

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,690
that means they do a lot of transactions
per month per year to do it too

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,539
what surprised me too is that I didn't
find a single really security engineer

73
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,560
that works there

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,950
sound found some software developers
just using kind of my online sleeping be

75
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,020
linked and in general searching on the
internet so they didn't see you so

76
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,520
either

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,849
so there are also selling these meters
all over the place again I as i said

78
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,240
earlier I've been seeing them and I'll
almost any major metropolitan area

79
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,160
the single meters style and then they
also have a multi parking space that the

80
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,710
device is basically my service like a
block or 16 32 pages spaces at time

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,409
so overall this makes to be a very good
kinda to produce you know 750,000 or so

82
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,430
meters out there in the United States
possibly international that handle eight

83
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,120
hundred and fifty thousand dollars with
the transactions per day per the website

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,090
so these meters handle a lot of cash

85
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,679
it's pretty amazing also not to be
confused with as I found the IPS group

86
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,600
group IPS group IPS our IPS group BB IPS
group limited an IPS group there have a

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,810
very generic sounding name and all these
companies are kind of scattered all over

88
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,490
they were just in the u.s. found some of
their international ones again <operand>

89
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,390
twenty </operand> or the BB IPS group
there is actually based in the

90
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,200
netherlands

91
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,510
alright so i did some initial
communication with them because i'm a

92
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,300
bug bounty enthusiasts that's why I'm
also a little bit of a proponent for

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,070
bugcrowd ask them hey do you have a
security bug bounty program or weighted

94
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,570
ingest reports like a responsible
disclosure program which can be silly

95
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,140
like something silly like an email just
have somebody in the community reach out

96
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,280
to them that if they say hey I found the
weird thing with your devices we should

97
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,020
probably talk about it

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,370
I had no communications that are at
least no reply and communications back

99
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,840
from them via email

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
I use the web forum on there

101
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,190
on the website written and an aspx by
the way and then also support at just

102
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,840
being a plain old email and then I
resulted to go in Twitter didn't get a

103
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,039
response there and then eventually I
went to facebook

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,690
you'd be surprised they have a Facebook
page because people love to like meters

105
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,430
i think so i went ahead and shot a
message to them on the wall

106
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,030
I say do you have a bug bounty program
and then here we go

107
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,039
kind of funny no they're clearly not or
clearly must be confusing them with

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,030
somebody else

109
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,369
maybe like the IPS group bb or I don't
know alrighty I - Pete us as a group out

110
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,580
there so that correspondent ended pretty
quick i did reply and say no I'm talking

111
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,270
about you you make smart meter
technology as you disclose their and

112
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,049
just wanted to find a way to ingest
reports and they suggested I email

113
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,200
support @ and as I mentioned earlier
that went nowhere

114
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,039
so maybe a later date after you find a
little bit more me d things to talk

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,700
about all actually kingdom and and try
to get a hold somebody in real life

116
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,130
I don't think i'm going to go to support
@ though I'll tell you that all right

117
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,510
the hardware itself may be a show of
hands as anybody actually seen these

118
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,289
before

119
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,370
ok you got 11 couple people in the room
all right they're very popular like I

120
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,490
said they're meant to work in the same
old housing that you've seen here

121
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,419
this housing has really been around
since like the fifties back in the days

122
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:21,539
when you just had a coin slot meter that
would only take coins quarters usually

123
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,260
and it had like a really rudimentary
mechanical system behind and no

124
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,750
electronics nothing nothing fancy either

125
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,669
then they kind of had next generation
that had a digital display and then the

126
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:38,189
ability to take smart cards and stuff
like that and as i mentioned i estimate

127
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,169
there's probably 750,000 these meters
out there on their website probably

128
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,160
discloses that they have a hundred and
eighty-five thousand but after doing a

129
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,400
little sleuthing i was able to find a
whole ton of proposals from the company

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,120
too many of the polities out on the
United States because it's public

131
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,870
information for you to see where tax
money's going so I found a lot of

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,620
proposals online that said we agreed by
25,000 meters of

133
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,790
at a time or something like that one
with all the services that they include

134
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,699
which of course it's a cloud management
stuff like that takes NFC or potential

135
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,240
to take an FC contactless payments
generally allows you to do credit cards

136
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,710
via the unit itself

137
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,550
more like a pay by phone application on
your mobile like an iOS device or

138
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,829
Android and as it says at the bottom i
wanted to point out how solar powered

139
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,580
with rechargeable battery pack these do
actually have a panel on the front of

140
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,480
them so that it can recharge your
batteries on board which I found some 20

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,029
minutes business which we'll talk about
later

142
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,740
they're also claiming that their pci DSS
certified as far as I know there's no

143
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,480
way to actually certify hardware

144
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,130
unless it can take a pin so this is a
lie or just made me miss representing

145
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,370
the meter thought that was a little
weird

146
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:01,020
ok alright so the m5 what I've
discovered these things retail for about

147
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,170
45 to 515 US dollars per hour online
proposals that have found as i mentioned

148
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,750
a lot of this documentation was freely
available

149
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,010
nothing nothing like no sleuthing no
social engineering was obvious and just

150
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,089
plain plain as day and then the service
support to get these things running

151
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,770
takes about five dollar 75 per month
that that's to get them license with

152
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,640
their cloud management system and then
the wireless fees that they're

153
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,330
associating with it and i also found
yeah eight cents per credit card

154
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,220
transaction which is that was funny

155
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,459
mainly funny because in San Francisco

156
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,910
they used to charge you forty-five cents
a transaction to use these things so

157
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,469
it's kind of a rip off if they're trying
to pass that cost to you

158
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,650
they did recently lower - 27 cents
transaction

159
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,790
I don't know any other major
metropolitan city that actually charges

160
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,469
you to use the card system but that's
what they pay for what they should be

161
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,910
paying so take your money as I said
coins chip card smart cards potentially

162
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:06,019
NFC which is misleading which i think
the NFC is only to get you to you

163
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,730
use an app that will read a little like
an RFID broadcast on it so that it will

164
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,639
use that number to pay by phone on a nap

165
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,420
so has nothing to do with the meter and
then of course cloud-managed what could

166
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,189
go wrong with cloud management when you
have 750,000 of these things out on the

167
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:27,049
street and then as i mentioned they say
they're made in san diego they actually

168
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:32,119
test that they're manufactured and
assembled in san diego definitely not

169
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,259
China

170
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:41,029
alright so let's see here they also sell
a lot of spare parts associated with

171
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,779
these so generally the proposals i found
included maintenance fees and then spare

172
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:51,319
parts like antennas modules batteries
and other the other housing features

173
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,549
even have an optical sensor that will
detect whether a car is parked there or

174
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:55,910
not

175
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,999
basically for my assumption is that they
would call the parking police to come

176
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,220
give you a ticket if you didn't pay

177
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,809
so that being said let me tell you about
my unit which i've named park markbass i

178
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,868
went back and forth my friends and they
said i got a new parking with part face

179
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,730
so that one

180
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,889
so as I said they're smart smart Clark
smart meters that are cloud-managed and

181
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,179
what I've determined is there's an
onboard cdma modem in this unit

182
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:27,319
so it's actually running through verizon
there's a custom chip there that's

183
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:31,128
mobile to mobile manufactured by a
company named tell it and I'll go over

184
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,480
that in a little bit too

185
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,860
and as mentioned they do have an NFC
rfid reader on it

186
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,970
maybe because I've had some mixed
discoveries on that too

187
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,679
and then they have a credit card reader
meant for chip cards or regular mag

188
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,629
stripe cards and then also EMV europay
MasterCard Visa like we have here in the

189
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,649
netherlands so these the more i would
say the more secure version of credit

190
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:59,029
cards that are out and then their solar
powered with rechargeable batteries and

191
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,549
I say that in quotations for a reason

192
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:04,790
and then there's a lot of other
identified chips and found on it which

193
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,949
I'm just starting to poke at now that
I'm getting a little bit more

194
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:09,949
comfortable with my living situation in
the Netherlands

195
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:17,209
all right so I'm gonna go thru the tear
down here which is really gonna go over

196
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,399
the three main boards that are in this
thing

197
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,179
the main processing board the modem
which is also integrated with the solar

198
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:27,439
panel and then there's a display /
reader assembly that has a card reader

199
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,599
on it so it's all in one unit also
there's a coin validator in there that's

200
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,730
kind of neat i might think with that

201
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,980
that takes a 55 sent ten cent in
quarters might take dollars to it i

202
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,299
didn't look into that yet

203
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:46,100
the little one dollar US coins there's
also other parts in here the batteries

204
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,169
which will go into I'm excited about
those

205
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:53,959
maybe i just love batteries you'll see
the antennas leds which are kind of

206
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,029
useless and then buttons and shit

207
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,579
alright so this is what the guts of this
guy looks like this is the main

208
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:04,849
processing board along with the various
components

209
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:09,259
there's actually some you can see
there's some stickers on some of them

210
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,949
which are actually meant to cover up
what's actually running under the hood

211
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:16,789
they have some proprietary part numbers
on them clearly

212
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,629
I what I assume is to stop somebody like
me from reverse engineering it

213
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,860
it's also covered and is really
disgusting weatherproof glue which is

214
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,059
impossible to remove

215
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,389
unless you use a razor blade or maybe
some other sort of chemical solvent I'm

216
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,419
not going to go through the dissolving
part of it because i like my my health

217
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:35,389
so just stuck with a razor blade

218
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,880
there's also some cool stuff on here

219
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,020
as you can see that on the very top side
there's a ports for both the display and

220
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,350
then the the modem and the solar panel

221
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,370
there's also some interesting things
this is a little fuzzy here but there's

222
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,730
actually an i2c port here that's
probably got some sort of useful data

223
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,960
coming out of it

224
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,820
the bottom is the power plug for the
battery pack or the backup battery pack

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,700
as you can see there's actually two
battery and battery that's a lithium-ion

226
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,290
battery cell there

227
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,020
that's a 310 milliamp hours three point
six bolts so it's about a watt of power

228
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,100
the whole system from what I've
discovered is all low voltage

229
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,730
it's all meant to run at three point six
bolts not 5 volts and not anything below

230
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,220
that and then there's also a couple
ports here there's actually some clearly

231
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,050
identified debugging ports up at the top
and then some other when I assume our

232
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,349
serial ports and then what this guy here
looks like is it a daughter board of

233
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,390
some sort or maybe a jtag interface i
don't think it's a jtag it looks more

234
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:40,010
like something is meant to plug in there
as an accessory and then these two guys

235
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,530
here for assume our sim card holders as
i mentioned this is a cdma model so it

236
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,000
uses I I me I to get on the network
doesn't require some chip but imagine in

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,220
some areas are selling it to either
locations i don't have cdma towers or

238
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,940
verizon or whoever's running
infrastructure there on a cellular

239
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,940
network right

240
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,060
ok digging into this like I said there's
a rechargeable battery there that's a

241
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,469
lithium-ion it's about a wat i found it

242
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,840
silly because it's only a wat battery

243
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,810
to have this whole thing running so
maybe that just the that that's the

244
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,020
whole the whole unit takes less than a
lot of power over the course of a day to

245
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,079
operate or something i don't know i
haven't dug into the power requirements

246
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,700
of this thing quite yet

247
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,610
there's an RFID chip on there on the
lower left of the battery for I've dug

248
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,800
into its attacks essential instrument
model that is meant to handle NFC rfid i

249
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,740
believe it was a 13.5 six megahertz rfid
reader system and then below that you

250
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,280
can't really see it - well i think i
have it marked by a little magenta arrow

251
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,839
there's actually an NFC rfid antenna on
it which plugs into the side of the

252
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,040
reader or so plug on the side of the
parking meter and i'll show you that a

253
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,959
little bit here to there is also the I
mentioned I to sea ports

254
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,160
there's also below the battery is a
mixed signal controller

255
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,940
it's also a texas instruments assumably
it's meant for the NFC rfid management

256
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,440
maybe maybe not or what I'm imagining
it's probably is for tues that was a

257
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,490
layered chip on her

258
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,810
laird technologies chip that big silver
block there that is meant for two point

259
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,389
four maybe five five big frequency
communication from what I could tell is

260
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,070
disabled on this model and also had no
hookups or had no actual nothing hooked

261
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,340
up to the antenna ports so the radio
seems to be there but not enabled

262
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,850
ok

263
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:46,080
the fun part of this guy's this the the
main what I'm calling the kind of the

264
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,340
master processing unit which is at the
top if we go back a slide here that top

265
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,459
guy that has a white sticker on it which
was a proprietary sticker

266
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:01,110
I removed it with razors and found that
it's actually a TI fpga and that's cool

267
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,159
because they have a lot of support
online for it has everything from jtag

268
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,450
operations reference pin outs of the
whole ship itself the headers

269
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:15,750
other specifications also a low voltage
and hella warts which in California is

270
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,760
lots for those that don't know hella
means it means it's got everything from

271
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,900
cereal

272
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:28,050
ins ins and outs but also some USB
capabilities which on the backside of

273
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,860
that board

274
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,040
there is some clearly labeled debug
ports and I imagine that those are tied

275
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,670
into this

276
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,600
fpga somehow which will go down to it at
some point maybe in the next couple

277
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,290
months

278
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,950
alright so this is the modem board and
solar panel the as i said earlier the

279
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,450
solar panels probably put a capable of a
lot from what i found on the internet

280
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,100
there's not really many 3 by 3 inch
solar panels available maybe for hobby

281
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,090
kits and stuff like that but that's
really meant to recharge the battery

282
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,669
systems on this guy in the middle there
is actually the tell it tell it cdma

283
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:11,940
it's a and c e 9 10 dual cdma modem
that's meant for 1x RTT and then I think

284
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,400
it's actually only 1x RTT runs at 908 on
eighteen hundred megahertz in the middle

285
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,290
of that guy was actually a lot of cool
modem port so things like ring reset cts

286
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,450
stuff like that so i could actually dig
into that and and run even some AT

287
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,650
commands to the thing if I wanted which
are also clearly documented online they

288
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,640
actually all these chips are found lots
of documentation for online which makes

289
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,580
me feel like my job will be easier later

290
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,149
and then there's also a weird USB plug
at the bottom

291
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,970
I didn't identify it here this guy right
here is actually USB port and when I

292
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,290
assume it's a direct interface into the
modem but I don't know where the drivers

293
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,710
would be found i could actually probably
will email them and say hey you got

294
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,830
drivers for this and then knowing
they'll probably give it to me and then

295
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,040
also there's a the right in the middle
there's some interfaces

296
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,620
there probably is again I presume for
some sort of gsm in silica daughter

297
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,949
board module or something like that but
this is all meant to run on cdma so you

298
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,650
just so to go back to the solar panel

299
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,490
it looks like its a 1 1 and just so you
know that's probably one white at full

300
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,780
direct sunlight

301
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,799
generally these are

302
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,489
mixed areas or even in the shade so you
can't really can't assume that you're

303
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:34,230
gonna get one one hour out of this solar
panel through the course of it through

304
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,869
the course of the day you'll probably
get a combined number of watts but I

305
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,899
wouldn't say that you're going to push
with four what every hour

306
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,230
ok so as I said I identified the modem
here to tell it c910 dual cdma 1x RTT

307
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,450
actually means i can push up a little
bit more than a megabit of of traffic

308
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,230
through it

309
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,909
this one is meant to run on verizon
which sucks for me because they don't

310
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,769
have verizon here in the netherlands

311
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,269
so I'm have to figure out how I can
actually emulate a verizon network and

312
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,730
then I also pointed out the USB port
there

313
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,919
this is the display and reader assembly
so it's got like a I don't know what the

314
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,850
the pixel density is I but probably
something in the range of 200 x 200 a

315
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,799
black and white with the LED backlit and
there's actually a little support there

316
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,269
to the right of it

317
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,840
that is for the buttons on the front of
the things you can add time cancel hit

318
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,279
OK and then there's a cool diagnostic
button right there which i found it and

319
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,419
form on a suspect i should when i go
back into the states

320
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,039
I think with a clever hairpin or maybe
even a paperclip you could probably

321
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,869
press that through the housing

322
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:47,580
so you get to the diagnostic without
actually opening the major up and then

323
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,580
there's a cable there's for the credit
card reader for max ripe

324
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:55,889
most of these there's actually pin or a
ribbon strip at the top that plugs into

325
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,998
the modem but there's also a reader
cable that plugs into the the main board

326
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:05,429
the master board and on the back i
haven't assembled this thing at risk

327
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,509
screwing it up we're making it and
broken but there's also some other good

328
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:10,859
chips underneath there

329
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:15,178
the smart or not the smart part of the
chip and pin readers underneath their

330
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,389
the mag stripe reader for the cards
systems all underneath there

331
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,760
ok

332
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:26,370
what else the coin validator like i said
i plan to tinker with this be fun

333
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,540
because it be the first time ever mess
with something that's meant to take a

334
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,600
currency and turn it into a digital
signal assume looks like the way it

335
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,980
looks like so far it's got some triggers
that seemed to measure the diameter of

336
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,790
the coin but it probably has some sort
of magnetic a reading ability to

337
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,690
determine the type of metal so that it's
not a fake coin or Lisa wooden coin

338
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,690
that's the same size of a quarter or
dime

339
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,280
so yeah this will be interesting that
play with I imagine that this whole

340
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,810
system is pretty tuned it could be wrong
it could be total garbage that to you

341
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,649
never know

342
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,510
alright so there's a whole bunch of
other miscellaneous parts that make up

343
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,080
this meter within the housing is the
coin validator connector here

344
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,750
there's also actually you can't see it
very well but there's actually a report

345
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,620
for external power to which I thought
was a little weird because it has a

346
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,830
battery connector - so I don't know what
that connector is actually meant for

347
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,120
this guy here is actually the backside
of the LED that's on the front of the

348
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,909
device and then on the left is the other
front of it than the antenna the square

349
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,520
guy over there says it's an NFC antenna
which I thought was weird because it's

350
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,710
listed as an NFC antenna and the parts
list but it plugs into the modem so i

351
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,930
assume that it's not for NFC rfid that
is probably to get the modem some some

352
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:54,210
signal that though in the middle is
actually labeled explicitly in FC rfid

353
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,800
antenna

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,090
unfortunately I couldn't pick up any
signal off of them using some off the

355
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:06,240
shelf like android applications to pull
to see what kind of NFC rfid frequencies

356
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,600
are being pushed out so I don't know
what it's using but I do know that the

357
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,730
chip that I said earlier the team Texas
Instrument NFC rfid module is meant for

358
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,690
things like my fair which is a very
common type of rfid card out there

359
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:25,639
some of them are encrypted some of them
are so all right so batteries

360
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:28,849
i was mentioning earlier and I put a
little arrow next to this guy you'll see

361
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:34,668
a close-up of it here as you can see
it's it says it's made in china which is

362
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:39,409
clearly in san diego somewhere and then
assembled in Mexico probably in san

363
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:40,369
diego -

364
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,899
and then what really kind of took me by
surprise as it says it's a lithium-ion

365
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:52,039
battery which is typically rechargeable
battery and so I learned after almost

366
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,579
getting my house on fire that this is
not a rechargeable battery because it

367
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,849
got really hot and I'm I why is this
thing not charging i had been letting it

368
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,168
sit on the charger for like eight hours
and so I dug into the label bit and I

369
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,519
was like okay

370
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,539
what tipped me off was actually the
capacity of the battery says it's 9,000

371
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:14,089
milliamp hours are nine hours to my
knowledge is no chemical density of

372
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:17,928
lithium ion that can actually produce
that kind of wattage out of this battery

373
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:24,200
so i started digging into it and other
than discovering its not rechargeable I

374
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,379
found out they're totally different
chemical chemistry there lithium tylenol

375
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:32,329
chloride which is a disposable battery
so it was weird that they actually put a

376
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,178
disposable battery pack in their meaning
that you'd actually have to services

377
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,849
battery after a certain set of life

378
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:43,009
this will eventually die even with the
solar panel on it go in a little bit of

379
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:47,209
math mode so let's say there's 12 hours
of daylight on a day and then you may be

380
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:51,950
a third of that would produce full solar
wattage on the solar panel

381
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,379
so if we're lucky were like 6 watts of
power a day maybe I'd say five watts is

382
00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:00,738
probably a little bit more realistic but
the battery on the mother on the main

383
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:05,749
board is only a 1 watt battery so you're
basically not charging anything the

384
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:09,829
whole day after that battery is charged
so they could have actually put a

385
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:14,089
lithium-ion backup battery in there and
charged it with the trickle charge after

386
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,719
the main batteries charged but i'm not a
parking meter engineer

387
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:23,299
I just found this out i did find that
these batteries are cheap as shit

388
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:27,349
they're like a dollar piece probably
cheaper and mass if you can get them on

389
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:30,739
like actually with the direct
manufacturer but on alibaba they're like

390
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,739
a dollar if you get them at thousand at
a time or something like that

391
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:40,428
all right so I'm about at the end of my
talk here

392
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,219
I went through the batteries which is
probably the only funny business that

393
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:43,819
found

394
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:47,629
oh by the way they did what annoyed me
was not the fact that they mislabeled

395
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:50,029
the battery lithium ion when it's not

396
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,450
is that they actually charge cities
thirty dollars per pack

397
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:56,959
so these batteries have like a hundred
percent markup

398
00:26:56,959 --> 00:27:00,169
you know some disgustingly large market
and they're guaranteed to die

399
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:03,859
they're not going to actually be charged
so cities and your tax money in the

400
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,309
United States is going towards these
which are intentionally meant to pale

401
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,279
so if you think about it there's a cost
of the battery and then you gotta send

402
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,999
somebody out there either a technician
or a parking meter that's trained on how

403
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,379
to replace them

404
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:19,968
so whatever cost associated with that
and San Francisco you have 22,000

405
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:21,379
parking meters out there

406
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:25,939
so do the math that adds up pretty quick
just to be just because somebody failed

407
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,909
and engineering on the power systems

408
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:33,469
alright so what I want to do next
crossing fingers and hopefully some

409
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:36,919
magic happens and i actually get some
community friends to help out where I

410
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,759
buy a lot of expensive equipment i am
going to try to take a stab at reading

411
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:46,549
the firmware off the fpga both the main
one and then as i mentioned is that a

412
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:52,039
signal processor of where this signal
processing one so that one might marry

413
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,139
it may not be useful but i hope that it
is i think if i can actually get some

414
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:02,299
firmware off their which for the website
says its password protected so i might

415
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:08,119
be totally failing at it but given the
company is even know what a bug bounty

416
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,488
program is or how to redo responsible
disclosure they could have just had an

417
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,859
oversight not put any password
protection on this

418
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:19,879
I do want to get it back online i have a
samsung network extender that's meant to

419
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,189
throw up a verizon cdma bubble

420
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,529
the problem is that some colleagues at
aiesec partners a couple years back

421
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,069
found some major vulnerabilities with
these Network extenders and then they

422
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:34,819
disclosed in the samsung and they closed
all of them up so I can't

423
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,640
unless I find an older one or if I can
flash the firmware to something older I

424
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,170
can't trick the gps and thinking that
it's in the United States because these

425
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,080
network extender is only meant to work
in the united states

426
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,189
all right i'm gonna take a look at all
so the modem AT commands possibly

427
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,970
intercepted if i can get like a
software-defined radio or something that

428
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,620
will actually let me analyze it and then
