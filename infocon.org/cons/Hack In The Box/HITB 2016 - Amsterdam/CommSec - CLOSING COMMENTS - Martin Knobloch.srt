1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,540
who have you heard about me

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,579
before today makes you noted that's ni x

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,650
sending it yeah that's our problem so we
have a company we are usually found in

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,090
the Netherlands but the existing like

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,919
excellent since the eighties in Finland
it's so originally a US company that's

6
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,769
why they let us are eunuchs mangled and
make sure

7
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:36,620
and what you know about finished people
is they're not very outgoing exciting so

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,149
they do a lot of business and 75 years
and which I started the internet and

9
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,949
since ur exercise this first februari
what we want to be different it's we

10
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:50,449
don't want to like me but making out our
employees so we want to be a community

11
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:55,280
base and I don't know how to box instead
the netherlands and we try to share

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,629
knowledge fire

13
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:04,759
Thank You Barry pay attention Bobby fish
fish always the same people

14
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,369
ok so the issue is what want to share
and all that so it's about the people

15
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:14,060
getting knowledge and sharing knowledge
so our assets

16
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,909
Bobby please so our asset is the people
and we wonder in have two people

17
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,340
involved that that's why we don't do a
long time

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,409
assignments and we want to have no one
percent contracting because the people

19
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,159
should be involved in our assets are
people would evolve and we want to be

20
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,030
more like a community and also we have
to make money of course but sharing

21
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,350
knowledge is out . saying that's why we
were interested in hosting this concept

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,210
rack because it's all about natural an
error and knowledge sharing the whole

23
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,380
conference is I myself very much
involved in all ways with a notice for

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,420
free and it's a contract to be able to
have people here talk and get multiple

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,959
free

26
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,950
that's all we need to thank you
