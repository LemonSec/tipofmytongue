that will be thinking some people for

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,779
making this happen so I wanna start by
thanking would you mind coming here

4
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:30,160

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:01:14,320
of conquering the roads now and then to
make sure my team thank you

8
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:29,690

10
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,790
ok so I would be a bit preaching before
dawn choir I wanted to pass against

11
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,500
disease like this because I thought as
ridiculous as one of my talks I wouldn't

12
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:55,050
say it's about how to set up groups and
teams diversity of teams and weighed in

13
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,410
at diversity is to have different
genders also the over to me like it

14
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,130
should be normal ever should do it and
yeah and I went to assignment in

15
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,169
Bulgaria I was surprised that they're
more than 50% of the people in a pic to

16
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:17,530
your email as hell comes here she said
daddy four people total trade and who

17
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,670
can talk to people

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:26,040
apparently they did something but males
fail today by extension because of

19
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,769
claimants

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,050
very high number of I talked about
diversity because we all have our box or

21
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,230
background on the skills and to extend
the quality of fifty mister extend the

22
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,399
team's knowledge and abilities and
that's why we need women in security and

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,220
women in tech so yes that's when I saw
the whole way behind in the Netherlands

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,410
being open modern

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,970
behind I think yes definitely we win 7
security is important and we have to

26
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,970
support us that's why we enjoy it

27
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:23,980
official a great day today as president
of the Women's cybersecurity foundation

28
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,480
it is a great honor for me on behalf of
the other book now Miss Mary Joan

29
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,600
hanukkah to welcome you all today what
is yet another first for the women in

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,070
cybersecurity and I say yet another
first because over the past few months

31
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,790
we have opened the first female hair
clip in the heck we just got the keys of

32
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,260
our first office the VIX office in the
world trade center in The Hague and we

33
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,980
are now here at the location of hacking
the box and packing boxes a special

34
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,328
friend of ours because it was at this
conference in 2014

35
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:12,160
that the first female CDF team joined
the stage in and now very very glad to

36
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,370
see that we don't we don't even have one
but we have got two and a half to

37
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,419
whatever that may be but to a novice
better than one so is it sounds good

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,270
all of these first make me very proud
make us very proud and when we want to

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:37,469
thank you for making this happen because
as you know most of you know because

40
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,880
most of you have been part of this
process it hasn't been easy journey we

41
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,500
have worked hard to arrive at where we
are today each of us individually at

42
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,979
first but now I think that we can
honestly say that we have found a common

43
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,969
purpose and united in that common
purpose is to be part of a community

44
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,789
both online and offline in order to
foster closer connection between the

45
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:09,780
under represented women in cyber
security in all areas such as research

46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,650
architecture programming policy

47
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,590
well you name it we got it I remember
back in 2013 when we started this

48
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,090
network we were hoping to find some
inspirational women to share ideas and

49
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:33,080
to combat misconceptions and when we
started our network we were hoping to

50
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,389
find twenty women that was ago and never
in our wildest dreams could we imagine

51
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:44,680
that we today have a network of almost
700 women worldwide

52
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:57,060
and their movement is growing and it's
thanks to you I mean is you spreading

53
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,819
the word she can you opportunities
pitching new ideas and it's these

54
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:08,629
ingredients that make our community grow
and make that we are not just another

55
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:15,099
female group not just another linking
group but we are a living breathing and

56
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,740
involved in community of ideals
opportunities and most of all inspiring

57
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,620
women which brings me to where we are
here today as I said yet another first

58
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:35,830
we are very very excited to present the
very first six security Woman of the

59
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,449
Year award

60
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,750
this is something that we've been
meaning to do for a long time because

61
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,949
we've met so many inspirational women
along the way and so officer very long

62
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:55,479
careful deliberation we decided to hand
this award to a person and it's a she

63
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:08,069
we love her because she hates the
cliches in cybersecurity she hates

64
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:14,099
cliches set shares the world is becoming
ever more digital or we are becoming

65
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:19,419
more and more connected as society and
independent as society on the internets

66
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:27,878
so you will never hear that from her for
over 15 years she's been globe trotting

67
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:36,729
the digital world as a true Trailblazer
she very much dislike Ste Apocalyptica

68
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:43,128
fears you often hear cybersecurity but
rather identifies clear-cut

69
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:48,840
opportunities and more importantly she
acts summit she provides a true voice

70
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,859
for those who are not often hear it as
not only women it's also children

71
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,490
teenagers and the onus and she not only
has a vision of a serious saying for

72
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:08,930
more digital world she truly embodies
the spirit so she knows there are two

73
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,439
children something you have to mobilize
office in other words permission is

74
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,810
strictly let's do it and this is what
she has done from creating Trustmark for

75
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,569
online shops to creating reminisce
website for certain safely on the

76
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:30,399
internet from distributing educational
DVD looks to lead in the lobby against

77
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,769
buying barbies all the tough legal
battle against child pornography and she

78
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,560
is not only done this in Netherlands
where she joined one hundred and fifty

79
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,609
organizations to our own organization
but also Blair globally where her ideas

80
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,000
continue to echo in the United Nations
Internet Governance Forum and beyond i

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,079
winner is not good for gender equality
in around wright's she's extremely

82
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,579
modest about her many many
accomplishments she hardly takes credits

83
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,210
she does not paroled her knowledge
experience she worked extremely hard

84
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,080
because she is truly believe she always
seems to have a talent for spotting

85
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,110
talent and for making people connect she
can talk for Aegis about the importance

86
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:24,370
of female role models in cyber security
without realizing that in fact she is a

87
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:31,330
role model herself in short she knows
what to do and what to move and shit in

88
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:39,970
doing so she moved us not only insulting
us that more importantly also inspiring

89
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,400
us to do more so may I ask all of you to
give a huge round of applause to the

90
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,640
first women one every year

named by women who cybersecurity my
online phone house

92
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:37,149

time before I just couldn't be it was at
