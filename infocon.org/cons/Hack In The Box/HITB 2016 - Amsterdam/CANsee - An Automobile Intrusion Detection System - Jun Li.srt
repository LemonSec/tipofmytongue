1
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,480
hello

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,529
the mylanese between for home from China
and my talk is about is about automotive

3
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,450
intrusion detection

4
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:35,540
so first tourney allow me to introduce
myself I'm a security research from 260

5
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:43,850
and i had i have beans and written
started to repairing cars when I was 15

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,489
so I know something about the car and
the after and i graduated from the

7
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,690
university and i worked as an
information security research so I think

8
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:01,370
it's my privilege to combine my
experience in cars and my experience

9
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,250
experiencing information security

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,000
sorry honey ok

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,320
and i'm now I'm not like there's some
many focus on this is security of the

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,050
embedded devices and the kind i am
researching our automotive intrusion

13
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,810
detection which is a serious threat like
me shouldn't miss rate to the drivers

14
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,130
life

15
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,619
so the outline of my talk will be a
quick recap of the state school of

16
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,690
connected vehicle security research and
in this part where i will talk about

17
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:47,899
their a few automotive of organ
principal and the hockey isn't and then

18
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,099
i will talk about the canvas on you
think detection which is my

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:01,350
work ok this is a our future intelligent
transportation system in which all the

20
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,020
vehicles are connected by via various
communication method you have the SRC

21
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,150
dedicated short-range communication for
the communication between cars and the

22
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,709
roads were outside the unit and and then
you have cellular connection for the

23
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:25,620
cars to communicate to the internet and
then you have the the then you have the

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,250
apps your mobile phone what you in the
future will your mobile phone and the

25
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,110
and your computer and you

26
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,130
you can also interact with your cars
here is your cup

27
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,380
so this you want this is what would be
like the cars on the road

28
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:56,489
our corn coordinated to to increase to
increase in finishing up the efficiency

29
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:05,489
of the after transportation system and
the this is a timeline of car security

30
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,140
research from the start they are just
doing some research regularly reverse

31
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,190
engineering the controller a conformer
for our to modify the performance of

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:24,299
their car and then the that any research
on the immobilizers they want to steal

33
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,709
the car so the crypt or used in the cart

34
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,110
fuck sake for a husband cracked and then
remote attack the form the opt for BD

35
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,769
place

36
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:44,579
oh BTW is onboard diagnostics interface
which means anyways you that the their

37
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:47,070
make make mechanic yours

38
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,500
they're dedicated to tour - can be
allocated was an internal network of our

39
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,660
vehicle well

40
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,090
the other network because there are
different control modules for the engine

41
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:06,530
and the engine transmission extractor
and then the there are research about

42
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,470
the remote control features of the
connected vehicle for example just

43
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,149
vehicle can wear vehicle can be
controlled via a mobile phone you can

44
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:23,390
use your phone to open the door - 22
also write somebody to drive your car

45
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,659
and then I think the last year

46
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,480
china mirror and chris valasek releases
are publishes our research on the grand

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,650
karaoke and the way us the code remotely
control steering and brake after of the

48
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,190
car

49
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,940
so this is a skip significant change i
think that the world forum for you know

50
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,560
before this that it is security research
is telling the truth and the life of the

51
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:59,510
driver drivers driver all and the the
passengers bottom from the the the the

52
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:05,210
the variability water strengthen the
really want to stretch the drivers life

53
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:14,630
I don't know if we can get kind of then
heading Gracie I so so what's the two

54
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,159
took new order to control and the
physical feature of their cars is to

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,370
inject can packets kind is a network for
four years to buy a used the two

56
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,460
networks the different ECU

57
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,560
what is you is you see you i will talk
about it later to connect the CEOs and

58
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,800
that and the connections are often not
in corrected or authenticated

59
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,969
so he could so that this is the present
in the challenge

60
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:50,439
well be talked about well give in at
this year's black hat there we will talk

61
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,079
about the no no no

62
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:02,229
the app the idea is to make make sure
Troy is that car hacking will become

63
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:08,469
easier and easier to there are many in a
car towards will be released for example

64
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:16,119
the can protocol analyzer and the open
source open source for another former

65
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:22,749
when software use the to analyze that
that is traffic so character will be

66
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,309
progressive and they will attract more
attention and after hackers

67
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:35,049
so let's say I example of the tip hack
how did they get into the controller

68
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:42,399
network out the vehicle and the vehicle
hasn't had a network that connect and

69
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:49,539
network the ecu's together and then and
I has a entertainment system which comes

70
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:56,019
to content Wi-Fi module so that the
attacker you use the Wi-Fi the wife as

71
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:03,249
the password is generated from random
seed the and their generation algorithm

72
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,379
has a vulnerability so they could cause
it calculates a different know that when

73
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,599
you first started this car

74
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,089
what did not used to say when you were
panel if you had also won the when

75
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:21,459
you're generated password hey kono ahead
calculated the password has himself so

76
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,349
he could get into the Wi-Fi and then
from your life I take it

77
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:32,879
- 1:00 abilities in the infotainment
system so that another them to access

78
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,449
the campus then they extend his organs
by using a rope rope rope base station

79
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,849
at the femtocell compromise himself

80
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,289
videos not to extend Syrians to remotely
control the car

81
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:53,519
I think from a hundred meters away and
then they discovered that if you use a

82
00:07:53,519 --> 00:08:01,379
mobile phone that connected to the and
Markham connected with sprint network

83
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:02,429
operator

84
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:13,799
yo could you send this attack internet
wide and then the mysterious that will

85
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:20,609
you face the future autonomous vehicle
is the sensor security and autonomous

86
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,899
vehicle will have mom various sensors
mounted on them

87
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:31,679
for example I'd our gps and there's a
the ultrasonic sensors but these sensors

88
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,009
are easy to spruce or interfere

89
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,429
the GPS signal as you have known that
from my contacts talk

90
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:47,758
gps signal can be spoofed and the
ultrasonic sensor also come to school

91
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,149
and master years but I had also said
that the the lighter is also can subject

92
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:04,319
set and said susceptible to to spoofing
and then this is the night attack i had

93
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,309
talked about

94
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:11,790
now i will talk about a little and talk
a little about about for the orkin

95
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,270
principal happen

96
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,500
modern cars that a typical , and
consists of the there's four main

97
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,880
subsystems you have a body in
electronics countries your instruments

98
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,640
that blaster remote keyless remote
keyless entry that is the security i

99
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,449
talked about

100
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,590
now that you know people immobilizer
security and then you have power to

101
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,660
hydrate and then that that flattened
that part is a what

102
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,860
close to the remote control of their
physical feature because they introduced

103
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,530
i will talk about X by wire systems and
then you have entertainment and

104
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,650
communication system this is the main
attack vectors of the for the hackers

105
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:05,680
because the this system often teachers
wife i want to see you networks

106
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,290
accenture then you have the safety and
the driver says that that part is like

107
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:18,069
the autonomous tried to car as distress
are facing the mosque our phones can you

108
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,320
have various sensors to a sense the
environment and to control the higher

109
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,540
for example the adaptive cruise control
uses radar to detect that distance

110
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:36,280
between the the car in front of the in
front I it in front of it and to some to

111
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,140
control that the engine

112
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:46,330
- then that's to control the speed ok
that this figure were

113
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,759
shows that the watch the power 10
countries consists of you have engine

114
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:59,749
you have transmission and you have a
brake system and I and you have steering

115
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:05,299
system that and next hour talk about the
x power system you can see that the that

116
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,848
the difference is in the transmission
steering and the the engine control

117
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:17,119
system because the traditional Cardinal
have the expire wires features so the

118
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,929
hacker

119
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,189
even he even even hey if hey can't
control over the canvas

120
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,759
he still cannot control the physical
features

121
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,699
ok i will have mentioned them either
your multiple times so her hair i will

122
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:39,709
be explained what it easier use this is
from wikipedia i think it's pretty

123
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:46,189
accurate and you see you is just a
generic term for come from that the

124
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:47,839
embedded controller

125
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,839
I think in the cars it takes the sensory
input or the drivers input negative

126
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,149
acceleration pedal and then output two
signals to control actuators to control

127
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,049
their there is it the modules that's the
the car

128
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,949
ok

129
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,008
Harry's an example of the engine control
unit

130
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:16,579
it takes and the it takes as important
multiple single active equation

131
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:21,829
relations which throttle position sensor
and the many faiths manifold air

132
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,728
pressure sensor actually my research
later

133
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,160
why we show that on campus

134
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,259
along with the action is based on the
power meters the interrelationship

135
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:40,699
between the apartment power meters and
then the output is that actuators for

136
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:46,670
example that the accuracy often are
several motors and when I think loves

137
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,349
and the fuel pump extra so that's it

138
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,009
look and more vivid example this the on
the lower left corner is the driver

139
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:02,269
acceleration pedal and then this pedal
and what is the head when the driver

140
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:03,379
press the pedal

141
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:08,180
the signal is connected by the engine
country life noticed the engine control

142
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,029
unit the the abbreviation for for you
Tony country unit and engine control

143
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:20,180
unit as a sand bath you'll have to keep
the base base base your interpreted

144
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,388
based on the context and then you have
the the sensors to monitor their drivers

145
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,110
input

146
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,480
you'll have their speed and input to the
engine control unit you have the

147
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,079
equations which picture and then that is
a you out for a single to control the

148
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:45,560
actual return back to the fuel pump like
the next day regulator the generator

149
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,459
exception so this video is just like the
system is the market closed of control

150
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,329
system

151
00:13:53,329 --> 00:14:00,138
this is from the ECU level but has owned
several other later we'll talk about the

152
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:05,959
4 car can be controlled and can be seen
as a closer to control system

153
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,390
ok this is this is the ultimate him as a
whole

154
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:18,500
you can see I talked about the engine
control unit but as a car for formal

155
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,940
higher level you can you can see that
the car takes input out

156
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,470
I takes as its import the environmental
data for example the distance between

157
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,210
the cars in front of it

158
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:36,140
the counterfeit the the the the and it
is not as they did a high position

159
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,620
map stripping for example and then
output the years the actuators

160
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:49,100
it's not the ECU actually you can see
the automotive people autumn had many

161
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,900
insects chirring country on it

162
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,520
they are networked together so when you
visit this into the other four you can

163
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:03,350
see me as a closer look control system
and then now i will talk about the

164
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,540
drive-by-wire system

165
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,500
what is drivers wire system drive by
wire is news

166
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:17,870
it controlled by electric electric wire
this on the left is a traditional or

167
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,270
drive-by-wire system

168
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,730
I'm not traditional throttle control
system in the dry work for us on first

169
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,670
on the acceleration pedal and then this
is mechanically connected to the

170
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:41,990
throttle body so it's safe from cyber
security perspective and and that this

171
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,310
this features a cable but he is still
mechanical connection in the middle in

172
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,410
the middle one and they're right

173
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,500
we have a what is got drive-by-wire
system

174
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:58,520
drive-by-wire system and the easy easy
in throttle control module takes in all

175
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,439
its import the drive is at the
acceleration pedal actually recently is

176
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,670
just essentially it could be a potential
our meter and then this signal is

177
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,920
processed by the easy in and then the
UCM output is single to control this

178
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,589
several model to control their throttle

179
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,089
why why why they were changing

180
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,309
from that to this is because they want
because human a two months up front

181
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,439
front of error

182
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:32,339
so if the if you use this system you
could find in difficult comes for the

183
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,759
throttle and more efficient way I think
and and above all that they want to

184
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:47,399
control the speed V other via the
electronic control system but isn't the

185
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,509
autonomous car you

186
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,230
you have to control and you have to be
able to control this rather buy

187
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,699
electronic system

188
00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:06,089
I don't know if that makes sense ok that
is that that's why II the drive-by-wire

189
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:12,270
system introduced to the cyber physical
strap and you know then that the ink

190
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,349
that the throttle control module is
often integrated way the engine control

191
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,398
unit and the engine control your net is
under canvas

192
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,958
then if the controller controller
network and the entertainment system

193
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,090
which has Wi-Fi bluetooth is also on the
combat soldier is a dangerous if that an

194
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,789
attacker can try the other than
multimedia the infotainment system to

195
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:42,059
control the income from unit and as I
said engine control unit takes many

196
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:49,110
input as and takes many import and those
input is transmitted on the canvas by

197
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,059
our news is yours

198
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:58,710
for example transmission 0 and the
sphere by wire is also there are also

199
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,830
the same on the left we have a
traditional steering system not the

200
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,250
steering wheel is is mechanically
connected via the universal joint where

201
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,610
is it

202
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,540
the oils so it is not hackable on the
right

203
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,860
it is a stair exterior there by wire
system in this system the steering wheel

204
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,240
is not directly connected to is it real

205
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,530
if it actually the steering wheel is
just a sensor it it it also just like

206
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,910
that the drive-by-wire system in the
center and give his think gives his

207
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:39,660
gifts is it there is a signal to the ECU
and the easy road out for the singles to

208
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,760
control their several model to come for
their steering angle off the cup

209
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
this and this issue is also on the
campus

210
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:55,290
ok like that that's this is what i said
a to deal with the vehicle as a whole

211
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,940
an ecological control system you have
the for example is your variable which

212
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:10,290
is made my people be the steering wheel
angle and the and the users press on the

213
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,290
accident pedal

214
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:25,928
ok i mentioned that the engine control
system has any say yo the transmission

215
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:33,370
system has an ECU but in fact in order
to do some certain tasks makes a

216
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,620
adaptive cruise control

217
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:42,158
this is you have to collaborate so in
order to enable the collaboration we

218
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,690
have to introduce some a network to
enable the communication between those

219
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,379
you see you

220
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:51,549
the canvas is this why this is why
canvas is used

221
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:59,769
ok this is a more general network
architecture of cap you have this many

222
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:07,629
what causes and for example the most and
media oriented system transmit i think

223
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:12,309
is for the infotainment system to
transmit high band ways and multimedia

224
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:18,070
data and you have the different campus
there are different I think they are

225
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,499
working at different data rate so there
can't predict they are connected via and

226
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:32,499
by a gateway so so you'll see that that
that infotainment system is coming is on

227
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:38,200
the most network and the intensity of
them have Wi-Fi signal Rabbitohs notice

228
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,740
that and i think the attacker open goal
show their the wireless connection and

229
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,269
then gateway and cut the drive can enjoy
drive kind is where your engine under

230
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:49,600
the

231
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
transmitting control module is up

232
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:04,510
ok that's is this isn't important let me
explain once again campus is used to

233
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:11,710
come networks that is engine
transmission and all the safety-critical

234
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:21,280
systems so so let me give you an example
of how the vehicle communication system

235
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,610
work for you know that this example is
is a bit

236
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,668
speed as an example to tell you that

237
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:37,030
how solid the speed as a parameter is
shared between the there's different

238
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:44,110
module first then that you need in
electronics need to be the ability

239
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:51,580
program and calculate the current speed
by from the data that the formula from

240
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,418
the censored a path that the sensor is
mounted on the way out

241
00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:01,090
so it could it could calculate the
current speed and then it's a trans meet

242
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,309
at the speed on the canvas

243
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:10,000
notice that the red line one instance
that stata that the the canvas is a

244
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,750
broadcast network broadcasting network
and this bit if the PSP control module

245
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,460
sending out this bit

246
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,059
all the modules on the can Network I
received that

247
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,260
and

248
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,480
we also do you say that the engine
management you let the also , engine

249
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,880
control unit it can receive this speed

250
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,030
why does it need this

251
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,970
this parameter it is parameter to
control the talk output because for

252
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:51,950
example when you are in a young adaptive
cruise control model the engine have to

253
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,880
know the current spirit in order to
control their talk offer to control

254
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,980
speak write and then transmitting
country you're going to need it depends

255
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,250
on the on the carrying the speed

256
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,750
- calculates how which gear which which
gear it should be yours

257
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,490
and then the adaptive poop adaptive
cruise control system received this

258
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,330
speed

259
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,080
good and then then I it then this system
and calculator and calculate from this

260
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,649
bit

261
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,740
I can decide for home how long the
distance

262
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,890
she it should keep from different car in
front of it

263
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:35,750
so this this is how can that work and
then through the Gateway this we don't

264
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,530
meet her

265
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,480
can you recieve the speed and the
display the speed and the City Council

266
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,220
owner and in containment system also
will receive the speed when it will turn

267
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,410
the volume the entertainment as mrs.
systems warming up when the speed is

268
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,350
high because the boys will be high

269
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,870
p 2 and the inertial navigation system
also need the current speed for

270
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,830
calculates a position not the canvas

271
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,050
ok I think this is in with the meat of
this point I'm bus sick money

272
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:17,090
the canvas is just a tool in next week
in it in to wire it different and if he

273
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,740
uses differential signaling it has a it
is used because it has very good and

274
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,160
anti-interference characteristics

275
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,430
the bass is a

276
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,910
it's very very mmm

277
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:41,010
it is very good at anti-interference
then because it

278
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:49,170
oh that's this it's not home for her and
I can skip that and that the basket is

279
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:56,220
that that the difference between the two
wires to to decide whether it is 140 the

280
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,030
single

281
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,540
so it's very such the very good at

282
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,720
for example the common mode interference
what will be in not interfere disk but

283
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,210
now the canvas

284
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:15,840
ok the frame frame structure the canvas
doesn't have the can't data from doesn't

285
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:23,159
have the original or recipient address
it just have a message ID so if a

286
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,660
package if mendacious packet it and is
detected an unnatural your cannot simply

287
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,940
trace back who have sent this managers
packet because it has no originated

288
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,940
address so

289
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:51,879
and it's his payload or if kayla is
often eight bytes per packet and the the

290
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,310
there are many many high early or
protocol that based on campus but it's

291
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,649
not not not not not the foot for for me

292
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,270
I don't consider that because that
parameter is the speed the gear ratio

293
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:15,070
the the the under the disc parents would
have carried in a single packet so the

294
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,260
higher layer in other ways you which
witch you has a packet segmentation the

295
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,830
data segmentation and the rear screen
assembly at I don't consider that

296
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:31,630
now I mentioned with them they can only
has a message ID the message ID is also

297
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:39,550
used as a privilege fear the videos
isness value to decide who

298
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,990
if if tool too easy as want to send send
the packet simultaneously

299
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,900
if you use this to decide to look at the
access of the past so so you for an

300
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,170
attacker is it cut cut on the network

301
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,610
he can simply lunch adidas Italian
adores attack the clarity of service

302
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:03,490
attack by sending packets with the with
the highest for our ready for example

303
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:12,310
with the ID 0 now the difficulty of of
can pass difference

304
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,240
no real time record requirement

305
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,580
the the the data is a real candidate for
example is this bit is real candidate

306
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,220
how you feel you know some some process
on it and the introduce extra delay in

307
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,050
my in interfere there

308
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,810
the normal operation of the system and a
half hard to trace back to a cinder

309
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:41,050
because it has no originally address
high cost of false positive because you

310
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,350
said all this easy use are controlling

311
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:51,639
safety critical function see if you for
example if you take you there is a false

312
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,990
positive and you cap off the
communication after you see you

313
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,910
you must cause certain severe parent
than your don't the natural

314
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:08,860
ok the attack type and apart from the
attack thick layers of service attack i

315
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,510
mentioned earlier there are many to
capture . two types of attack that

316
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:19,419
targeted can pass package packet packet
injection parameter is perfect for

317
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:25,929
example the the the g-pack they have
their the car only allows you to control

318
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:34,570
their the steering system when the car
is traveling at below below 25 miles per

319
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:40,658
hour so if an attacker want to control
the the car's steering system at high

320
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:41,440
speed

321
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,919
hey I might have to prove this big

322
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,260
so what I'm doing is to detect this kind
of that attack

323
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,980
so you can see that this year's black
and black hat will meet you there will

324
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,940
be talk about at math con injection
techniques that you can see that there

325
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:11,140
are certain private records for the
attackers to control the the physical

326
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,350
feature so let's wait and save my
measured can t takes that kind of attack

327
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:24,309
and then i will talk about the address
research on the cat anomaly detection

328
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:30,460
the and the way i will also talk about a
lot of the industry had have been doing

329
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:30,820
-

330
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:39,399
prevent car hiking next the the sae is
and I think it's a society of automotive

331
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:45,549
engineering and in the united states
they have published recommended and

332
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:52,090
recommendations to not keep develop safe
vehicle system separate security systems

333
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,668
so they have awesome actually intrusion
detection short positions that they have

334
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:03,279
not mentioned that video you have to get
to some research of and it and then

335
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,659
under some folks have started started
companies companies through to

336
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:12,669
specialized specializing automotive
cybersecurity if you don't know that

337
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:18,070
and there's the the August you can i
think is an easy israel-based company at

338
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:24,009
the specialized in car security and this
is the American best visual business

339
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:24,669
trip

340
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,940
yeah it's also specializing in security
up

341
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,720
ok the that this is the

342
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,330
the original architecture I i come up
with ways to you know traditions the

343
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:44,970
difference that can pass from , and i
tried i think why try to add a pack at

344
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,620
the community college teen asian
contribute away at each easy yo

345
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,039
so that if Y easier is because be
misbehaving

346
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,549
I could to cut half of the communication
to kick it off from the can network but

347
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:06,510
later I realized this act picture and is
good but it is very hard to implement

348
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,510
and a very expensive team to implement

349
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,590
ok this is an actor but is more contests

350
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,559
if you are evil even before atop this
architecture

351
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:24,418
we asked you're faced with the same
problem of false-positive detection cost

352
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:31,140
and the pockets already track origin
origin tracking regarding the pockets

353
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,929
already tracking problem somebody said
they can tell from the can message ID to

354
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:43,409
tell who have sent those message but i
think this makes sense only the normal

355
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:48,419
system because the normal system which
is yours and what our meters is

356
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:49,590
predetermined

357
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:55,379
for example the electronics stability
control programs in the speed so the

358
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,070
speed is wrong you can tell that if you

359
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,389
you can tell us with us and by that you
see you but your money is packets in the

360
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,350
network

361
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,918
each and all cancer any packets with any
ID

362
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,950
so it's not that good

363
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:17,340
- I think I want to use this this
architecture that this is a canvas

364
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,139
we can't control the communication of
this this easy use these modules

365
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,460
by the way i could use and ideas to this

366
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,780
he picked if there is something wrong on
the network and then were you

367
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,299
this is the result of the idea idea

368
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:40,918
to control a 44 contact with use this to
control the awareness get away to

369
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,789
control the infotainment system we cut
out all the wireless communication and

370
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:48,960
and the fire

371
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:57,480
anam on the this is kind of like makes
their car for back to a safe mode result

372
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,850
any internet connection

373
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:10,529
okay this one is more realizing okay
this is a research by a diner there

374
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:15,749
they also waste time some research we
also have done some research on this

375
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:23,100
campus anomaly detection but they use
the entry fee because a car like that

376
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,869
the car system is kinda is not as
complex as the computer network because

377
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:35,970
all the data is is the atomic the little
cake is ordered those parametres and

378
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:43,019
this parameter Tsar i think is can care
acute recreate characterize the cars

379
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:47,700
status and the constant as is limited
very limited so you okay

380
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,840
and you click for the model to be there
to take that back and they use the

381
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,509
entropy based at a normal attack
detection

382
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:03,960
i just want to mention it I don't judge
you for your work is good or that and

383
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,909
the share the injected fall camp before
packets for quality . . and they detect

384
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,389
three of them and the there

385
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:21,419
the remaining one that didn't detect I
think it's because it's not deviated

386
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,529
from the not divot tool far from the
normal value

387
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:32,308
ok man want mr. field a mathematic model
of the car

388
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:40,660
and the wager . way with them it's this
is the same as to handle those pan power

389
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,009
meters together

390
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:49,810
for example i can tell you if this kid
is no more or not more by using other

391
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,940
parameters for example the are key in
the engine rotation speed the rotational

392
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:01,060
speed and the less than a gear and care
i use this to parent or so to speak to

393
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,090
Detective if the speed is wrong

394
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:14,440
so it would be somebody was it will tell
me that that you then the speed and the

395
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,490
RPM work here

396
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,259
their relationship is it can be
described using this simple linear

397
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,030
equation right

398
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,820
you have the rotational speed until that
the output from that is our output from

399
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:33,040
from the engine and the gear ratio of
your multiple a security issue under the

400
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:42,279
1400 no power china has also has their
the here so you have to multiply a

401
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:55,180
constant is that mixes actually and this
won't work because this is a car car

402
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:03,370
transmission system it if this is where
there are p.m. and the the output or is

403
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,370
connected to the review wheel

404
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,410
it has many classes and I don't lie for
anybody understand heart is collected

405
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,600
if if it it controls the output of the
top

406
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:22,750
so this classic these classes where you
want to introduce some non-linearity so

407
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,780
the near equation i just mentioned
cannot is not sufficient to describe

408
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,780
this how the system work

409
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,259
ok it's not not media

410
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,190
ok so what to do

411
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,260
so way I ok

412
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,850
i also want to mention that the speed
half the speed has many characteristics

413
00:36:51,850 --> 00:37:00,460
that can be used to to to say if it is
not normally as enormous are normal for

414
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:06,670
example this this bit is a continuous
variable you can make sure that if it is

415
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,070
continuous the mission to make sure that
it's very simple and the change rates

416
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,500
actually an acceleration and
deceleration you also have its name it

417
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:24,040
because now only this important top top
sports car can accidentally relation we

418
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,920
can accelerate from zero mile-per-hour -

419
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,150
- 104 miles per hour in 3 seconds so
that doesn't make sense

420
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:47,140
ok now i just want to use this figure to
show you that the many power meters are

421
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,120
related to each other

422
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,900
for example this this this line this

423
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:00,370
I think purple one is the acceleration
pedal the drivers input and the you can

424
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:04,330
see that the driver press on the
exterior preparation panel and as is our

425
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:12,220
travel and air air flow rate and the
speed our team that will go up with the

426
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,569
acceleration pedal but this does that
seem can be

427
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,910
please describe the user and simple
linear equation of course not

428
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,080
so what do we do - to build as

429
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,060
this there's a model to this crap is
this relationship

430
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,540
ok when you use the machine learning

431
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:41,410
but before we get to the Machine and in
part i just want to say that

432
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,160
why what one howdy when you use this
this this model

433
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,660
you know you've got them for example

434
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:54,879
now what let's assume that we have
already build a system model

435
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,520
ok and then when you use the lab data
stream and the extract the parametres

436
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,710
for example this bit here

437
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,210
RPM and then we use this this data to
make a prediction

438
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,680
they are this system model and then we
use the prediction for example I use the

439
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,830
current gear kinder RPM current
acceleration pedal value is those values

440
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:29,650
to predict the current speed and then i
use this predicted speed to compare with

441
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,040
the actual speed I received on the
network

442
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,460
if they are TV they had drunk too much
the two dif that there's a predictive

443
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,800
what is David David too much from the
they actually received value

444
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,000
I am NOT as an attack I say I think that
speed has been spoof and the and I we

445
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,270
can also use all the power meters to to
make a prediction of all the parameters

446
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:05,200
oh now i use this it helps managers
received on the network to make a

447
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:13,180
prediction of all the parameters because
their system is a trend or traded from

448
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:19,540
the moment data so it if that that that
they have data is almost it's not

449
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,380
one when the system makes the prediction

450
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:30,460
it will not be the center so it will
deviate very much from the that input so

451
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:39,340
by comparing them white could get the
tell you features and tap ok that's the

452
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,120
name is introduced and tell you what is
machine learning

453
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,009
actually this is people are you are you
because we use the neural network

454
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:54,130
what is a newer oh ok the owner is this
forces and is in Europe you have this

455
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:02,320
input X once your ex and that is an
input vector and then ever

456
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:10,720
every your x by weight and then and that
this this some no way somewhere that the

457
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,810
way the weight together and use this to
go show a transfer to the transfer

458
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:23,200
function is often are not is often a
nonlinear function so I think this is

459
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,390
where they're the nonlinear
characteristic is he is described

460
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:34,629
because in remember that the linear
equation cannot describe the system but

461
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:39,670
the hair wait we have the number in your
unit because the by using salvation

462
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:43,570
training advising we can model your
system

463
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:50,470
ok ok this is a new network in there is
the haven't had many new rules

464
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:55,149
so actually you will use the neural
network is just exactly

465
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,460
nexus we have an infant here and

466
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,440
having hidden in your eyes and often
they are only three layers and i will

467
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,830
publish the coordinator and you actually
take your pick it yourself

468
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:17,750
ok let me show you the hard and newer
left port by go to the this website

469
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,010
ok this is a while and websites that
created by the machine learning experts

470
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,130
you can see that the there

471
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:10,030
this is a mural this is a new network
you can compete and configure network

472
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:17,410
and you want to to certain task for you
can buy well use this model to to a

473
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:24,520
classification task and the state on
that date data so i click our start

474
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,680
ok you can see it

475
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,480
this model and this Nevel can classify
that that that's it

476
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,460
very surprising perfect glue and and
then you can see you have to

477
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:49,000
ok this is ok i will install her because
that the the deep learning is a very

478
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
complex subject

479
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,149
I just want to give you the basic idea
how this this this works

480
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:01,510
actually when you use this let work
differently when you use the normal date

481
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,520
hard to travel network

482
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,980
I think I used about 88 minutes 18 18
minutes of driving data to train this

483
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:19,060
train neutral neural network and you can
see the this nice are thicker than those

484
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,740
ones those because how to explain that I
think

485
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,009
ok

486
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:36,300
I just tell you how they're training
process what is it's like okay way quick

487
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:43,500
i mentioned and show you the new left
work I used in the powerpoints life that

488
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:50,130
the and machine you track the training
process is like just use a template

489
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:57,060
mathematic model and then you use the
training data to add adjust their the

490
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,060
director of the weights and the network

491
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:06,840
Neuros to to model their system so it's
kind of like create a mathematical model

492
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:13,020
form the training data and how to how
the training did have

493
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,720
how did learn how low the Justice of
weight is just as a machine gun in the

494
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,500
apartment

495
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,590
so let's say they're the result

496
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:34,920
ok I I message to this is in your neck
network and I also mention that the in

497
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,220
Europe very important there that this
vector that it has a weight so the

498
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:46,770
training process is that like just
adjust this weight and then uncured the

499
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:55,259
system and unclear the output and the
input vector is I said it's very close

500
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,810
to the training data

501
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:05,520
ok this is the carrier's through to the
experiment

502
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,350
this car has made several physical
features and then the X by wire features

503
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,250
i mentioned for example it has
electronic brake

504
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,240
you can be the break can be controlled
by the electronic system and its

505
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,839
steering in extra and the next one
expense struggle and soon your

506
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:31,680
connection cloud service blue ski-doo
clears at cell phone to open the car and

507
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,640
the country

508
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,839
you can you get a mobile phone to
remotely open the car for your friend

509
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,230
and yours also have seen your
connections to update

510
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,180
soft while or are they like

511
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:52,580
ok let me show you their the the cyber
filled up i'll mention that i'm

512
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,549
currently collecting data from the
engine control

513
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,869
come back ok just this video is just
shoot to show you a lot of this car

514
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:00,349
honey

515
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:08,030
as the XY our system now

516
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,030
sorry

517
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:19,799
yeah

518
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,750
that you're just two wires to twisted
wires to connect through the canvas and

519
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:30,000
the museum countries and and the
software you can collect the can data

520
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,589
ok this is there's no driver in that car

521
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,430
ok

522
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,119
the car has drive-by-wire teachers and
also can control this theory via the

523
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,490
electronic system

524
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:11,560
so that's why we bought it I don't but
wait didn't believe it because of

525
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,560
because it looks like all

526
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,160
ok

527
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,490
let's continue ok is it this is a
network architecture of the car we used

528
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,140
to do the experiment

529
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:35,589
it has multiple canvas but we we acquire
the data from the engine can come to us

530
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:41,470
because the painting canvas has the ec
in engine control module and the case in

531
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,899
transmission control module

532
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:52,180
now they want this is what the campaign
is like i mentioned in the canvas

533
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,049
happened

534
00:48:53,049 --> 00:49:00,190
I have a message ID and the the message
I be didn't actually see what is that

535
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,900
this is a parent conference for example
you can tell the eye from the idea to

536
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:13,510
the ID wonder . the hexadecimal value
and it carries the ins is payload the

537
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:19,089
the status of the front door right door
net all about all the state-based orders

538
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:23,710
you have to reverse engineer yourself
because this is kept

539
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,039
I think highly confidential to the
manufacturers

540
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,730
so i have spent a lot of time doing that

541
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,220
ok

542
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,760
ok i'll show you the knife data stream
what is not like you can see that way

543
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,910
with I got a candidate base a reverse
engineer as a candidate base and I

544
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,470
attached it is too

545
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,709
can't can't mean analyzer

546
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:02,430
you can see the instrument status light
okay we got that and I can go states

547
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:11,700
this is automatically show on the unless
so far and so for now . in the system .

548
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,960
this is someone who actually have five
step

549
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,570
this acquisition which I have shown to
you and the data pro proposes

550
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:27,450
I wish I will tap published the account
later and the data analysis the because

551
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:31,049
i have a little ultimate all motive

552
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,900
background so I know what kind of data
is related and treat yourself

553
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:47,070
I just chose I think 70 meters myself
and then that the messages feature

554
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,650
selector and model training and testing

555
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:56,130
so now the model training program
process is just and your your product

556
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:01,710
for your your video is training the
house you have input for a processed and

557
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,970
then the

558
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:10,140
actually I i tried this model on a
server so I this is it is our position

559
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,490
to help

560
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,580
and this is a can database reverse
engineer

561
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:24,690
ok this is a the scan data block output
of the analyzer

562
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,530
so I ever everything I do is based on
this block

563
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,060
so the data purple process the script

564
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,920
texas takes this month as its input and
an output shows a table of data

565
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:48,720
ok then the data have to go through all
these three steps to a nomination

566
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,330
information something a success and
don't need to be each lens guessing it's

567
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:58,020
very simple and the this is the
normalization

568
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:05,310
but actually I had a few pit for that
exists because when I normalize the data

569
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:11,610
i calculate all these data in order to
calculate the maximum and minimum values

570
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:18,990
from the deficit but notice that for
example the speed the this training

571
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:25,319
Davis it may have the maximum speed of
seventy this is 70 miles per hour and

572
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,390
they all your that back to move to
normalize the data but later if you want

573
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,250
test the model and you

574
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:37,110
the the test data is has a higher higher

575
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:45,049
maximum speed value of that make 80
hours per the 80 miles per hour so that

576
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:50,329
the model is just just done work so make
sure to do some action

577
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:54,529
I accurate maximum value and meaning
meaning Mario

578
00:52:54,529 --> 00:52:59,420
ok the campus is a serial bus

579
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,289
so the data is coming and you serious so
we

580
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:09,349
if you want you want to know at kanki
was parameter is what a value we have to

581
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:17,029
interpolate so the the the black . is an
actual value i received on the campus

582
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:23,059
and the red ones are the internet in
turn interpolated value 0 and the

583
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:27,529
subsample of course this is very easy to
understand because we interpret it

584
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:31,369
interpret with so many values and the
values

585
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:38,240
I just - just don't mess tres so you can
see that over a mural up the time your

586
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,240
body just doesn't change the way I
subsampled it

587
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:48,500
ok this is the result of something you
can see the data is starting to change

588
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,609
over time

589
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:55,490
ok this is this this this figure is
actually very important because I said

590
00:53:55,490 --> 00:54:03,979
that way you want to use their task data
to predict sit the data no matter how

591
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,039
many past it out of the way they used to

592
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:17,660
so I used I think 10 10 10 . from the
past to project to the value of were

593
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,129
predicts the vial

594
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:29,269
why why is this let me explain it using
the speak it would be more accurate to

595
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,990
use this .

596
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:38,520
to predict this point it is and the
angles just a point at this time to

597
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,550
predict the next . does not make sense

598
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:52,410
ok so this is that is why way which is
the 70 data points of input vector

599
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:58,830
because we want to you include the
temporal features of the that that

600
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,869
there's parameters

601
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:12,180
ok i will happen is code and the contra
kappa theta so this is a result way just

602
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:18,180
to pick up speed as an example to show
you the real out and i think that the

603
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,140
blue one the blue curve is this bit we
predict it

604
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,500
and the purple one drink one

605
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:33,180
ok is is the the white value real one
and you can see it is pretty

606
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:40,500
I think pretty good and then this is the
mean square error i calculated miss

607
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:48,270
Curtin squared error on paying 10 points
and you can see the right thing and

608
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,280
principal and now you're not

609
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,930
let's test its are attracted a tack
traffic

610
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,140
this is the spoon

611
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:03,210
this picture is that the RPM is been
having us proof

612
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:12,150
I you consider ok you can see that blue
area under the curve at the top left

613
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,900
corner

614
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:19,680
I don't assume this this in a little you
can see that it's not because the they

615
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,740
are originated that they took him a
follow these simple data and the

616
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,970
attackers also some of the data so i
think that that's why the curve is look

617
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,310
like with this oscillation

618
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,650
ok

619
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:39,109
listen is the attack and the attack
traffic

620
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:47,480
ok but the result is not is like well
okay then Mr Graham over that n is the

621
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:55,819
condition comes to secret of 10 and 8 on
points and is the above curve you can

622
00:56:55,819 --> 00:57:01,430
see that that obvious we have this
attack traffic you can see that we can

623
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:07,430
pretty accurately detect the this attack
because when there is attack the

624
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,069
deviation is very flat

625
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:14,720
so your voice sit a threshold we could
detect the attack

626
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,020
ok this is a kind of this is in McCarthy
and the ninja the population of the

627
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,038
white papers ordering these are white
people also mentioned anomaly detection

628
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:31,640
and they said that the if you detect
anomaly maybe you for back to a safe

629
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,020
mode this

630
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:38,869
what that is what they said and I think
the idea is quite identical to mine

631
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:49,770
and this is people's I want to thank you
ok ok that the content that person

632
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,569
present it is

633
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:55,410
I'm not oh my that matter

634
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:59,250
I didn't know to do it to them my myself

635
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:10,559
so all by myself so I will include the
references in the in the in the slide so

636
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,420
you if you are interested in cash
security you can with all those papers

637
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:22,380
ok I think we're you still have four
minutes for questions that shit

638
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,940
thank you very much for the presentation

639
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:33,960
we have any questions

640
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:35,940
all right thank you very much
