1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,789
so welcome to the server

2
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,910
about unlocking stuff we like to present
you are from work call a sports and

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,130
asteroids is like a bridge between a
hardware and software pen tester

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,570
first of all we are I'm you know not to
see you or about security

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,510
I'm black attic in the books or
something speaker now and I'm a simple

6
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,390
security veterans because I'm the old
guy in the team and I'm the former chief

7
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,379
security officer of ago Toby company in
a hotel

8
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,129
demons and Julia hello I'm Julia I'm
electronic engineer at apple security or

9
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,129
french company and I'm a security
consultant and I create asteroid project

10
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,990
and today we are trying to explain your
what it is

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,589
so about security in one slide we do
some training concerting and we made

12
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,330
some products because we

13
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,360
main our own products like a sports and
our DNA is based that we do some secret

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,690
in IT and in IOT so Internet of Things
security so and a lot of things there is

15
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:34,740
some privacy concerns security concern
because as room must know any IOT object

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,990
to reveal information about the user
about the html5 player into eccentric

17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,020
cetera as we are packing box

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,160
we don't lose your our time with this
marketing slides

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,200
however the main idea is that a
tentative scenes could be the new

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,600
playground for a kerr and you can change
the slide every weeks if you want and

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,350
every weeks we have some trouble with
IOT <time> six </time> or IT security in

22
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,070
the news

23
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:15,150
this is our view of family 20,000 feet
view of IOT system the big ecosystem

24
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,720
there is a few main parts first

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,370
this is the electric device there is a
communication channel

26
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,450
oh well you're a connection or our
original frequency a connection and

27
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,649
there is something in the cloud as
everything need to be in the cloud and

28
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:43,380
our system aim to be able to do some
stuff with electric Odets so only he

29
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,880
work on the side

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:53,310
so from a security speaking we think
that's our way I could be the new

31
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,550
software because in ITC stem there is a
lot of security function that are

32
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,890
already available on the offensive part
and on the difference apart

33
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:11,488
however in the hardware there is a few
security function that are available for

34
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:20,010
all the IT ecosystem and people are just
doing stuff with IT and IOT security so

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,079
we decided to create the Toluca lass
ployed to let IT consultant to be able

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,550
to do some security guard it's our
security pen test in the IOT world

37
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,030
without the need to be electric engineer
so we need we have create a transport

38
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,110
from work to become a bridge between out

39
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,530
software pen tester and outerwear pen
tester

40
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:55,020
so this is the only speaking part of the
of the conference and now Julia will

41
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,140
make some demonstration about asteroids
in our talks

42
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:09,179
yeah so the first step is to open open
the system in this case we tried to add

43
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,410
it as this

44
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:18,298
it's a fake lock system when you put a
god you you have a green light when it

45
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,520
is true and they're right life when he
is wrong it just for training purposes

46
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,690
of course

47
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,880
and so the first step you you need to
open it

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:38,340
it's okay so go on is to figure out .
all the continent is to obtain some

49
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,500
information of the ships

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,580
you can read the name etc etc and after
that you

51
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,599
you need to find the ship with very
sensitive data like microcontroller with

52
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,590
flash memory external flash memory or a
prom

53
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:06,599
exit all rights are so over the next
step of course is read or write or do

54
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:14,669
something with this ship and after that
a reverse engineering is needed is a

55
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:21,210
goal today is to demonstrate a true to
help you to exploit some information for

56
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:29,099
this step with a spot you can read and
write and after that you need to to try

57
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,250
to reverse with some classic

58
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:40,719
skills so sorry have a big butt

59
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:51,580
so the goal of course is to jump or the
data on system because rob some keys

60
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:59,198
something to that I like a log or
whatever is something not encrypt or it

61
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,699
is depend on out of your system is not
the goal today the go today just to

62
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:10,990
through to demonstrate culture expects
to the data just for example in IT

63
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,580
system you have some or electronic
devices when you want to communicate

64
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,878
machine-to-machine you need some bruises

65
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,849
I don't know if you know all these
bruises but it's not very complicated

66
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:32,229
but when you don't have any tool to read
this data is not easy or the day so you

67
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:38,020
need to try one tool for one versus one
boosts and as a tool for another one

68
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:45,008
extra territorial so you you spend your
time and in my company it's it's our job

69
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,650
so we have a limit

70
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,520
a very short time to to do and it and
you

71
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,758
you need to focus on the reliability and
not on as especially office of data so

72
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:03,570
the goal is to other from work to
interact with all these abuses with a

73
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:14,370
very easy step one or two state so and
by graphical interface to avoid some

74
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:25,590
trouble with a common line accelerator
just to understand what is asteroid you

75
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,560
have a sprite with the database like
metasploit it was at the name is like

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:40,410
metasploit you have a database and you
put some technical information like

77
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:50,370
speed is dependable service abuse and
when you have a a big data database you

78
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,789
can just read in fig up in step

79
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,710
just take the name and put it on there
is a graphical interface and after that

80
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,210
you need just to click on one button to
a fight some data

81
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,039
it's a goal of asteroid and after that
you can choose your

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:18,419
your base and you have 60 for input and
output and after you have your target

83
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:25,229
so why we have 60 for input/output it's
because when you want to want to write

84
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:31,258
with power abuses i don't know if you
know that but you need to put about a 20

85
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:38,250
or sometimes Sergey a bit to create as
address this is this

86
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,659
and you have some beach for a data
sometime

87
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:49,680
aight sometimes 16 and you have some
cable for the control

88
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,430
so most of the time when you want to
read a bar memory

89
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,779
you can find this memory on Rueter for
example you you see a slider adds a at

90
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,770
the end of the demonstration we was a
polymer you you

91
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,800
I i I'm sure you you and you need to be
very a lot of cable and you need to

92
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,709
generate wrote of as a single to to be
able to read the content so a sprite can

93
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,949
do that and I feel the the wiring you
need just to to to page one vision to

94
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,540
read the other content

95
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,760
it's for that we have a lot of input and
output and you can imagine a lot of

96
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,970
things because it's based on FB a so you
can trade what you want

97
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,380
if I you want sweetie spi in the same
time for the moment is it's not possible

98
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,750
but because we we need more time to -

99
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,860
to add this possibility but for the
moment it's just it you see

100
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,219
and after that spi exeter but we can
imagine a we we can try it

101
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,970
three or four to see in the same time or
what you want

102
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,640
it's possible it's it's a framework and
you can change what you want

103
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,699
so next step of asteroid

104
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,219
it's is the same which we add a scanner
data base

105
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:24,350
so for example if you have a jog or some
specific ships you

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,610
you can with the scan area of like
metasploit you can find some exploit and

107
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:38,090
the goal is to to put all the wire on
the your target

108
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:45,560
it's the wrong way and just what is a
Briton to find it and after that you can

109
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,089
expect all the data

110
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:55,280
it's possible on a jtag so I'll wiring
the beginning and maybe in spi but is he

111
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,339
an HTC but if he is depending if it's a
flash or something like that and the

112
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:10,070
goal is is to try all the possibility
and fine as your data with a very simple

113
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:17,270
way to do that because we are helping to
22 picture wire and just one button

114
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:23,060
I'm sorry I can do better

115
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:30,619
it's not possible to do better and it's
the goal of our approach is the next

116
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,430
tape

117
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,680
I don't know if you know the best
products or something like that

118
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,420
if you want you to see what which is a
difference

119
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:49,939
garage is a very good tool but to hold
our I sink and you can process of power

120
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,010
and memories because you don't hire more
than and 10

121
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,010
they're aware

122
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,180
you don't have any graphical interface

123
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:10,189
not exactly because as a community
create your some script and eccentric

124
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:17,390
cetera but it's not negative so and it's
based on a microcontroller so you can't

125
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,850
you can't Sean change anything in
microcontroller except the code but you

126
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:30,380
have a out where limit and false i think
is is is not enough today when you you

127
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,530
see all the IOT system

128
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,459
you're just a greater a is good

129
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:45,770
true but is just used by to identify
some wire and you can interact with you

130
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,150
can't you can't interact with your your
GTI got some simple as that

131
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,160
if you want to to find as a yr you can
bet is is enough

132
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,930
you you can do more so it's not my
favorite tool

133
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:05,959
you are a good fit for spi it's not
about the actual yes it's good tool for

134
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,300
that but only for ispirt I in it is
truly meet you

135
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,670
you have tomorrow and it's 24 oil
security which in our way

136
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,860
you know you don't have a always spi
Bruce's you you can have a lot of more

137
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,700
that are in spi one yr or something like
that you need to have a platform more

138
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,540
powerful

139
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,719
Angela asteroid based on fpga fpga so of
course we can change a lot of things I

140
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,330
don't know if you know fpga is different
like a microcontroller because it's very

141
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,010
very lower layer

142
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:49,069
it's like anand and it's a deliverer of
gates

143
00:13:49,070 --> 00:14:02,960
so you you can only create a logic logic
sings and you you are very low and with

144
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,660
that you can't write your own state
machine with to process more protocol

145
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,030
and eccentric cetera

146
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,550
facts what we want to create is exactly
the same that with the the metasploit

147
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,859
I've done with a software we need to
create exactly the same password listen

148
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,760
platform but for are working so with
fpga you you will be able to create you

149
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,800
own a vm module like you can create your
multimeter sprites

150
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,240
but you need to understand is there is
quite complicated

151
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,220
and my father was part of aspiration

152
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:54,930
it's the wiring you will understand
after why in audits when you want to

153
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,630
urge its security and when you want

154
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,710
sorry when you want oh gee it's out
where you need to purge why you because

155
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:11,100
it's real life you have a real bored and
if you want to extract read our whatever

156
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,970
you need to purge why are on the top of
your system

157
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,720
virtual like desperate

158
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,340
it's not easy because you you need to
read some data sheet to understand where

159
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,640
you need to put your yr Exeter and you
you lose real time and I don't like it

160
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:44,130
so for that we require a separate with
64 led sorry and I don't hear and

161
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,810
Britain we are real

162
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,819
we have a demo just after but when you
click on your CL you you can see where

163
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,230
you need to put the wire

164
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,500
so of course for you to see you have
only to wire

165
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,190
okay but when you want to wear wear a
bio memory with bout search of

166
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,790
wire it's very interesting a system

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,870
I'm done

168
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,070
I don't know if you are interesting x is
an internal processing of a splode but

169
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,740
just who is familiar with electric
design and electric stuff in the room

170
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:29,019
okay okay well more you

171
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:38,170
we are a pc with a graphical interface
and we connect by a microcontroller for

172
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,439
also USB processing and after that we
connect microcontroller with a PGA by to

173
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:54,790
spi and alice is ph program as a fpga
and inside the fpga we create each state

174
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:02,019
machine to process it we see spi is the
beauty one wire or you are exeter exeter

175
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:10,780
extra and it's time we want to to use
versus FBI is program it by

176
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:19,899
microcontroller by your Giri gooey and
it's easy just click on the button and

177
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,530
the fpga change as a to be a view

178
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:35,020
just to explain all we create a split at
the first day of where we are a small

179
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,830
company you

180
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,010
yeah very small and patient

181
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,400
I don't know if you know the process
when you want to create your own board

182
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:54,370
but it's not efficient but it's well
sometimes you understand c d e you you

183
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:04,178
need to to Perth disease on the top of
your PCB and use some tool and the and

184
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,919
you can purchase a the past sort of
passed on the top and you can remove

185
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,020
that you need throughout a very very
good accuracy to do that and of course

186
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,270
with

187
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:21,270
squash is not possible because it's not
very accurate on the top of your desk

188
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:29,610
and extracts were up so we need a more
efficient tool and after the stencil you

189
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,360
need to

190
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,820
so they're all the component of course
is not possible to do that for each le e

191
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:44,429
64 on each board exeter ex2 r is to
complicate so after that we create a the

192
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:54,930
are made over reflow oven with custom
PID for the oven and just a motion that

193
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,810
we are very secure the company

194
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,679
there is a bottle of water just being
this

195
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:11,670
this system is directly connected to the
electricity after that be

196
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,790
we need to to buy some best tool to do
that

197
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:23,820
professional Allah sencilla tool

198
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:30,480
it's more accurate you you can obtain
more I can see with this tool you have a

199
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,060
happy can play smashing on the middle is
to take some competent

200
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:47,459
I on the real and you can put it on the
top of the PCB very fast fast only and

201
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:55,320
on the right you have industry a reflow
oven when you press the button you have

202
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,240
about 100 degrees in less than two is
gone and it's better

203
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:09,540
so you can zis of final version of a
spurt

204
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:16,260
because the out where is allowed where
and you can change to be a view of the

205
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:24,240
outerwear by code because it's fpga so
it's for that will change as a software

206
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,920
all of yesterday two morrow and

207
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:36,680
are they that's the hardware stays the
same so we have a ESD protection we we

208
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:45,410
can use asteroid in 3.3 volts and five
vote we use a slight groan as cyclone a

209
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:52,940
tube from idea and we have us picchu to
connect the board and reprogramming

210
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,960
cetera guitar

211
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:03,140
justjust motion before the hour all the
tool work there is main part of the

212
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,560
hardware and software parts software a
GUI you will see in moments and software

213
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,780
API to connect to the to the ball is
open source so you can change it you can

214
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,790
verify its you have the ability to
create your own modules in vhdl yeah

215
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,149
so you can you can use this ball for
your own needs

216
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,060
yeah you don't need us to be able to to
let us have time to make some specific

217
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,919
PhD in modules and I I provide you a top
late for out there our crotches

218
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,770
- chain I don't know if you know but
it's it's a tool chain for this is a DJ

219
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:44,060
and you can just click in you you have a
top plate and it's well perfectly

220
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,310
so what you need to put you on a vhdl
code to to do more

221
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:56,570
the board is gross main the API is open
source and the gear is open source and

222
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,629
if you want to act our system you can
act the aspirant bored with another

223
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,630
hospital just for training purposes

224
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
please

225
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,570
soon the next main idea of a sprite

226
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,340
it's your move I think it's a is

227
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,689
yep I i want to remove all come online

228
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:31,820
not exactly because sometimes we need to
you need some very a lot of stuff on

229
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:40,070
knoji and we need to to create something
like automatic so for that you can use

230
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,129
APA in Ruby

231
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,260
so you can't reach your object of
asteroids and you can use Lupe cetera et

232
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,920
cetera

233
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,860
it's not a program but you you don't
have any a command line for that because

234
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:03,229
I we want to create a graphical
interface to be more simple you

235
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,890
you plug your board you start you click
on your company and you click on them to

236
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:18,650
step and we use these are just after and
a spurt a is trade for that but for

237
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,100
expect we want to to read

238
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,219
I don't know and one on wed time base
again or some single site you you can

239
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:37,570
and stretch your will be because we will
publish all example also use your also

240
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,220
use my a PA

241
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,960
and so you can do what you want with
that with any GUI you have very to

242
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,550
project a PA of asteroid and graphical
interface in the next step so is two

243
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:00,190
different project but it's the same of
course but if you want to change

244
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:07,600
anything you can because you can base
your work on APA if you want if you

245
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,389
don't like our graphical interface you
can remove it is not a problem

246
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:19,240
and just to make us a summary would
prefer tool with only come online tools

247
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,750
and could you raise your hand if you
prefer come online tools

248
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:31,570
you see 50 50 row we will see after the
presentation if we will if you will

249
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,590
continue to use

250
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:39,220
come online tool you will see we make
exactly the same question at the end but

251
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,730
you can you you need just do to create
an instance your object so sometimes

252
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,940
it's better like come on line so it's
more efficient if you use APA

253
00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:00,780
then come online I sink ah it's not the
last but you got son

254
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,190
we have it's not very good we we have a
demo

255
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,669
I think it's better but the goal you
have a data base on the middle and when

256
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:18,840
you you are in the figure of instep you
obtain some name of your ships and you

257
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,530
can you use the search

258
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:27,620
field two to find your your memory or
microcontroller or something like that

259
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,490
after that you need just you but your
mouse on import and export and a

260
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,950
one-click you are all the content of the
memory and it's enough to obtain

261
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,390
information even to see you of our
security could use it

262
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,940
yes and you have a wiring and helper

263
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,090
so we we see that just after yeah we we
go on the table

264
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:04,399
I I think it's better for you now so for
example

265
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:18,950
here I have to I have to memories

266
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,630
it's not easy to see it

267
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:30,049
yeah we have 11 here and the second one
just next

268
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:34,190
sorry we have a problem on top but you
you can see

269
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:43,610
yep it is not a good idea and yeah urs
spi a memory trust me

270
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:50,870
yes it's a 25 of microchip memories and
on the leader you have a microcontroller

271
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,649
from st electronic stm32 one android
sweet

272
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:04,549
AB AB eg6 ok just to understand the the
the demonstration

273
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:13,820
it's simple and the Bob the board here
simulate and electronic lock if you

274
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:22,070
you have Putin if you until the right
combination if you if you look at the

275
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,210
right code pin

276
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:29,269
yeah there is a great green lights on
the top left of the ball and if you

277
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:32,389
of course under the wrong one it's a red
light

278
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:38,600
so the goal here is with the
demonstration is to be able to perform a

279
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,000
pen test on the hardware just to find
some vulnerability in the board without

280
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,909
tools that is I care for everybody will
will already do some hardware pen

281
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:55,399
testing in in the room

282
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,399
ok

283
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,090
their computer yeah

284
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,310
so for example for it to see memory
memories

285
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,040
also he's not very good on your screen

286
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,640
I'm sorry for that bitch you see memory
need some addresses if you want us write

287
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,290
some data on it to see memories and but
it's not a program because we are a

288
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,230
species can air of course on asteroid

289
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:36,890
so you can see your data sheets and
check your board and you can obtain this

290
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,900
information if you look at on the top of
the memories which is boring

291
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,480
I prefer use automatic tool so for that
you can start also

292
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,810
well I need to plug my board before its
picture

293
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,830
yep

294
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,590
it better

295
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,350
so

296
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,620
we are we upload the the firmware in
fpga and after church we have HTC state

297
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:26,590
machine inside the fpga in this case are
on it you see Bruce's boost it will only

298
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,330
one and we have two memories in your
peril

299
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:38,289
so we have for a dress for it to see
because each device of redress and right

300
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:45,400
all right so just win one button when
you click you can obtain all addresses

301
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,270
available

302
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:55,090
so for with we need to check the first
one and the second one so i think we

303
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,439
don't have any time

304
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,090
so trust me it's a very good such if
that's exactly right Sarah is on the

305
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,418
second one so we try as a second one
memories

306
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,580
so we we set the address here and we
save but it is different for me

307
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:24,399
so it's perfect and after that I need
just to click on export I can process a

308
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:30,789
smaller dump if you want you can stop a
true or address system addressed and you

309
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:33,460
can choose the length of the jump

310
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,429
but in this case I want to read all the
content of the memory and all

311
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:44,530
information of the memory is inside
settings you have the size of the pay's

312
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,210
the total length

313
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:52,330
I'm sorry is not very good for you and
two that stays here

314
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,220
Shay's exercises this information is on
the first page

315
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,890
officer that shit and the next step of
aspirate very soon

316
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:11,620
you are on the internet sharing platform
and the goal in is when i create some

317
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,549
competent

318
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:15,120
I need just to through

319
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,590
to put a right click and applaud my
company on the and Janet and I up all

320
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:34,980
the people do the same like metasploit
it's a bold but in all I case we need to

321
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,770
export some of the content of the memory
we need just to virtue on the desktop

322
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:50,760
here for example each you see ya in to
see and for exports

323
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:59,340
I have tried all the content of the
memory all he's done is finished and

324
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,889
after that i can read the content with
blessed

325
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,890
for example is exactly similar a detour

326
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,260
it's not good for you

327
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:17,309
yeah i'm done and I can the box a very
secure password of course it's not the

328
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:23,100
goal of today to express some positive
data so the password is here

329
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:40,260
it's a a b c you can shake as it's on
the board when I put a abc3 be she

330
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:47,340
I have a green life so i can describe
the relative that up

331
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,570
of course it just for the training but
be careful because in a very with all

332
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:01,649
the case we can expect some sensitive
that I like that is true

333
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:07,350
ok so yes it's just a demo bats

334
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:17,309
not exactly a double and fries about you
if you want to change I want to change

335
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:18,270
the password

336
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,520
I can change directly the information in
the file

337
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:39,139
for example I change a baby and they
save and sorry I take the file on my

338
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,730
desktop

339
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:49,429
oh yeah oh yeah it's not have been filed
it's for that

340
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,210
yeah

341
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,320
so after that we can read again to be
sure

342
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,560
for example right is done just to be
sure

343
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,319
so I erased the file export again

344
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,859
ok the password seems to be ver change a
be bc it's not easy for you

345
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:49,230
I'm sorry for that so we meet right so
we set the board

346
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,839
I changed by are very a BBC

347
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,850
ok so it's it's it's a password inside
the memory

348
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,980
you can change in a couple of minutes
less than a couple of minute

349
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,460
so now if you are a software and sister
or a very good experience in outerwear

350
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:29,050
and you don't want to spend your time on
this sinks

351
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:38,140
you can use asteroid I'm information I
am I know all these big seas but I love

352
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:45,700
a sport for that because I now I can
focus on sale in our ability and not

353
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,129
also a structured data there at the
beginning I I need some time to create

354
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,950
my tool for example four barrel memories

355
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,250
you need some time to - to spend your
time

356
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,150
three or four day - where - also
addresses etc etc

357
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,570
here you can read and change and right
again in less than a minute

358
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:16,840
so I think it's very good tool for orgy
of course its work on spi SWT exeter etc

359
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,380
I think I have one more minute because
it's enough for the demo

360
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:29,650
I have a microcontroller and I want to
read the content of the microcontroller

361
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:37,240
most of the time and microcontroller
contain a source code

362
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:44,379
not exactly up to code and I somebody
could and you can extract some christian

363
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,210
put your core or something close right

364
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:52,810
it's a very important for is a company
if you can extract the the firmware of

365
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:58,690
microcontroller you can take it and put
on a Crone are some single site you can

366
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,510
reverse engineering the film way except
there is it also for our company is very

367
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,869
complicated if somebody can disrupt the

368
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:14,210
somewhere in some case if you forgave
the flag a single flag without

369
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,980
protection signal flag

370
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,790
you can express the firmware of
microcontroller like now

371
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,360
and just like that

372
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:31,819
so maybe is depend if so good why a ring

373
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,820
no I need to just swap

374
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:54,439
yes my my target is it detected and just
after that i can use export like spie to

375
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,470
see extra extra for example

376
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:07,490
vmware dog being dumped is finish and if
i read the content

377
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:13,250
I can obtain or a film where of
microcontroller and if you don't trust

378
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:13,880
me

379
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,640
you can see our string of the
microcontroller because it's a training

380
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,180
board for our training it and we have a
lot of a tenant connection etc etc so we

381
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,000
have a spring

382
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,550
- - to print on the concern and you and
you can see the spring in the firmware

383
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:40,490
so for you can press this film we're in
a ad a pro or something like that

384
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:45,319
- to reverse the family so in less than
one minute i can as well as the firmware

385
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,390
if it's possible I can change it

386
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,970
exit exit error asteroid is the bridge
between out where and software

387
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,359
after that you need just to reverse
engineering

388
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:05,000
it's not too easier but but but before
you need to read the content and out of

389
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,780
the data

390
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,180
yes

391
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:18,619
just some yep rise up and if you are if
you want to

392
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:28,100
- why if you want some help to wire the
memory you can use helping wiring module

393
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:36,410
so if i take the board in the good way i
can see the same ship on my board who

394
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:42,259
real bold and I can see this symbol on

395
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:49,960
asteroid if i click on it to see clock
and I go on the camera wrap for you

396
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:57,850
I can see the first led here and I i
know i need to put in to see clock here

397
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,730
after that

398
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:08,410
sorry SDA is the same things is the
second one is not if you don't trust me

399
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:16,810
you can go ear to fry one by one here at
of course for it to see you are only two

400
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,900
wire but trust me

401
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:27,490
for example yeah maybe it's better for
you here

402
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:42,500
if you need some help with a spot you
can because you have a lot of in this

403
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,650
case I sink 32-bit and cable

404
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:55,250
so if you are helping it's more
efficient because each time you click it

405
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:00,050
shine you you see where you need to
purge the wire in this case is here

406
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,770
yes it's not easy for you

407
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:13,250
yeah except the rights that are extra
and I have a another demo but not today

408
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:21,980
in life because it's too complicated
with meryl memory but for example if you

409
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:30,410
want some number i know all the people
are like the number for HTC all is put

410
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:40,609
this piece is supported by SB to you can
up to 25 but 50 it works perfectly as WG

411
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:47,210
and as you go and interact for the next
step we have G tag one wire etc etc it

412
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,430
has a beginning of exploit and is based
on fpga so it's not a program you have

413
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,740
exactly the same hardware and we need
just to change the soft and you can

414
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,839
create your own module if you want

415
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,299
send us your module to be important
aspects because it's a farm work for the

416
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,079
community

417
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,700
so why is a burden sharing platform is i
think is available soon

418
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:19,848
it's not exactly a 30-percent now we we
are more like eighty percent for adverse

419
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,130
identification yes scan air

420
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:29,390
yes it's 30 and love seeing you artist
is done in all next bit of action not

421
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,828
this version we will change a lot of
things better I PA better

422
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:42,170
a bitter code tools and I I don't forget
a little better but yes we are you

423
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,170
sniffing and SP is sniffing into next

424
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:56,020
release and we have these things
available for an arrived

425
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,880
24 it's already available because we
need this

426
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:10,450
- - to drive some drones because when
you when you when you provide trainings

427
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:22,089
actual training session we will create a
new exercise is to palm and you act

428
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:31,300
automatic drawn I don't know if you see
our video but you or next training you

429
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,250
learn all track

430
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:39,460
sorry all true audit and and after that
you

431
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:46,840
you try all these things on a very real
system like automatic drawn i create a

432
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,619
system to have a takeoff and landing
automatically by soft and the goal is to

433
00:43:53,619 --> 00:44:01,570
explode their own or what you want the
drawn by why i always buy a damping p.m.

434
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:07,630
where experiments were in fact it's a
capture the flag challenge at the end of

435
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,160
our hard-working trainings

436
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,730
but for that's if you want to see it you
need to register to the next black and

437
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,359
USA

438
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,299
yeah go on and take an airplane tickets
so I suppose that all right

439
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:25,540
your story is already available for that
and made us about that duration I don't

440
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,460
know maybe we can ask you what you what
what do you think about that because we

441
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,590
are not sure at the moment

442
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,400
do you think it's in an interesting way

443
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,590
that's the asp road not giving but the
aspect API will be included in

444
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,900
metasploit is it is it a good good
things for you or not we were seeing

445
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,950
that it's a good coating just want
people to people

446
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:55,390
ok so you need to we we need to develop
only for your specific box

447
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:03,520
ok I think I hope you have money and of
course out converse exit is that if you

448
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,000
have any idea and don't is a day to to a
made me or purchase on guitar <operand>

449
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,640
twenty </operand> of course is community
so it's for that it's ok for you you

450
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,160
understand and for example if you have a
richer you need it

451
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,089
it just for photo pimples

452
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:33,220
yeah it's not a real one all I op all
the people in this room know this future

453
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,339
yeah of course so in this case here if
you want to it's like the one where you

454
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,800
can go on the website it

455
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,190
it's some time is better or if you have
a sprite you can this ordering is a

456
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,030
memory and but all the wire on the
memory

457
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:59,680
it's not very easy directly on the top
of the board but you can create you on a

458
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:07,390
crystal reader like that or use this
type of tool and you can play all the

459
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,680
way or by a sprite so in this case you
understand because you you understand I

460
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,490
up

461
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:20,439
why I create the wiring helper because i
have a lot of wire and if you swap and

462
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:27,430
some just one wire so swept to where it
doesn't work you can you can't have some

463
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,109
very good from where

464
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:32,319
so you need to put all the wire in the
good way

465
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,880
so is

466
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,960
it's not a very fun part but you can do
that with asteroids and you can

467
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:53,089
in this case exciting field we're here
so i think we are near the the end of

468
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,500
the of the

469
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,820
decision so a

470
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,480
this is our tool this is not a new
project

471
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,750
we need your feedback you can modify our
asked us to modify something in the GUI

472
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:13,560
or into API and i would like to thank
you for for coming to the station and

473
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,560
this is time for quit

474
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,660
many vendors today implement things like
checksums and even encryption in their

475
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,350
firmware do you have modules where you
can

476
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:44,529
once you figured out what they're doing
automatically recalculates and decrypt

477
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,850
encrypted on the fly in your graphical
interface it

478
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:56,830
it is not the goal of asteroids for that
for example you can use been work but

479
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:00,819
yeah yeah exactly

480
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,299
yes exactly is a good idea and to be
honest with you it's not the goal for

481
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:12,579
the moment yes but it's good idea

482
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:20,109
I op if all the people like this project
i can use open the city

483
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:26,890
I can use been war etc etc it's not
complicated to enter a two to send a PM

484
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,359
wherein in this tool

485
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:35,529
so yes but it is not my job to create
this for the moment it just to have a

486
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:41,589
good platform but if I have the time
after that maybe I can contribute on Ben

487
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:44,589
work or to like that yet

488
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,790
yet the judge is the next of yes you can

489
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,240
yeah yeah it's possible yes unity

490
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,129
you need to understand the APA but it's
easy you are I think you you know that

491
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,910
yeah it's possible because it's just a
ruby object

492
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,839
so you instance you get to the firmware
and after that you can put it on your

493
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:27,549
custom module yeah it's it's possible
right here

494
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:31,150
yeah

495
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:34,150
how big is the current database of
support of chips

496
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,819
sure but I i think you have a few right
now

497
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:47,279
yeah so for the moment know if we not
exactly this because we will keep from

498
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:54,029
some device in our local a narcotic

499
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:59,819
yes for the mentholated just the
beginning of a sprite we we need to

500
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:02,609
finish is a drawing platform for that

501
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:09,690
and after that I priggish or 6i are and
I it's like me that's right at the

502
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,069
beginning you you need

503
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:14,670
it's very complicated to the mood

504
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,240
- - in fact that on the data sheet

505
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,979
it's just the first page but you need
just put some information on shoe field

506
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,940
if all the people of this room

507
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:35,309
trade one component maybe we have one
where the continent in 10 minutes so

508
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,069
yeah

509
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:46,850
yeah

510
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,999
yeah

511
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:52,009
yeah

512
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:57,050
sure sure I I see some of the components
i recognized by the bottom wondering as

513
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,740
well is if you have a chip that is not
supported

514
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,220
yeah but you know the guy oh ok

515
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,330
yes you can't write directly on the
graphical interface if you want

516
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,319
okay but can you also like a numerator I
was it let's say is I to see but you

517
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,470
don't know the ping me out of the chip
can you actually in the race and find

518
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,970
the right ship automatically

519
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:21,680
yeah okay I don't think you you have to
set it manually right and then four

520
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,740
elements with me quickly but for example
of memory you can clone and you can base

521
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,069
a new component based on

522
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:36,190
a competent inside the database so for
example we have a memory with a

523
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,640
a kilo of blow

524
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,549
and if you want 60 kilo you can
typically duplicate your memories and

525
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,040
just change the size and is enough

526
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,210
you off to company yeah

527
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,559
yeah

528
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:15,660
sure I understand but you have a sort of
different approach to jtag emulator for

529
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,690
instance where you can actually say okay
I notice jtech but they don't know the

530
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,470
pain weigh out

531
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:25,560
figure it out for me but for ya yeah
okay

532
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:33,750
yes I I ok

533
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:40,500
for SP is complicated because you are
nothing when you sense something is

534
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,210
depend of memories

535
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:49,950
I don't know it means maybe is somebody
I I have a good idea but not my idea for

536
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,310
spi it's for some flash memories

537
00:52:53,310 --> 00:53:00,180
you can read some ID code of the flash
and for me for the moment i think is the

538
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:07,319
only way to obtain some information of
SPI memory and in this case I can

539
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:15,000
identify SP is not a problem because i
have already implement the cross wiring

540
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,690
so i can put it you see where i want

541
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,619
so in the loop I can try all the
possibility

542
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,090
it's works but on my better version and
I think we are

543
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,520
this version in next month's yeah it's
well perfectly for SWT you put a trailer

544
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,440
on this

545
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,160
for example here I have a8 way up

546
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,390
I put all the way up and add just a
little britain and I and I wait and just

547
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:47,400
after that because that's what can read
the content of the film where he can try

548
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,570
to come here directly

549
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,680
and if you put a beam walk or something
like that just up there

550
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,919
you can export directly as the five
system for example

551
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,050
so I op with you where we can try to
very good interesting stuff

552
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,320
yeah ok thank you answer yeah

553
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,460
yeah

554
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,470
five more minutes

555
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,399
yes

556
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,150
can you give me know okay okay

557
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,880
you should work

558
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,239
No

559
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:34,479
ok yet we are in plan to implement other
voltage levels like 1.8 or 12

560
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,479
yes it's good idea but we have

561
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:44,829
it's a good idea but it's not easy
because when you use Peter you add some

562
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:54,429
confidence and it was that I in my slide
I put 25 is depend in well is the bend

563
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,959
of the length of your wire

564
00:54:55,959 --> 00:55:04,509
so yes but not mean that you are not
even trying to do you don't have plans

565
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:11,199
yes I want to try but I don't have the
time but you can put a translator or one

566
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:17,859
. you to sweep 13 and expresses our but
yes it's good idea

567
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:24,129
good little not yet that's exactly the
answer

568
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:29,799
thank you any other questions

569
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:36,558
okay well please a warm applause 4 11
and 1 York
