1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,759
i'm going to try and save an awful lot
of time

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,690
a fast and i know that i'm scottish and
have not turned on my microphone however

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,730
we can you hear me

4
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,890
yeah fine good rate we come here we come
closer so it's good it's no problem

5
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,720
ok so i have what we're going to talk
about is an advanced persistent attacks

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,260
and one of the reasons that we're going
to talk about it is a face that we keep

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,010
on here and over and over and over again
and it's a phrase that people cannot

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,239
define very well and literally I was in
the a top-10 bank

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,919
perhaps I don't know something's playing
what will I was in a top-10 bank the

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,610
other day and I actually had to explain
to them for appt store which is a little

11
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,610
bit worrying if you stop and think

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,689
I give any much perfect body

13
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,990
you're a piece of shit up in black but I
couldn't resist that bangle an anagram

14
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,380
McGovern right so I'm a little better
angle for you

15
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,350
it's got about 50 billion people in it
its core large steel manufacturing works

16
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,689
it's go ambitions to be a very large
superpower but it's got huge

17
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,008
agricultural second but all kinds of
problems and things like that

18
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,909
that's the Democratic Republic of angle
and that's the country that we're going

19
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,299
to be talking to make today I am right
now by going to apts people don't ever

20
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,310
seem to get the percentage is great
either

21
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,560
this comes from the cops right so I'm
not not just making a popular night

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,540
there they can say their name tte % to
be easy or moderate and they mean easier

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,870
more than a different sense than you and
I mean easier more than a little means

24
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,970
you by not the door and get the guy

25
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,430
all right but mark sometimes actually
believe it or not they mean they don't

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,030
have to put in a huge amount of effort
to get the particular criminal or to get

27
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,680
the crane right

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,810
what the car could really concerned
about is the two percent they classify

29
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,870
is more direct to heart and the group
them as apts and the three you mean

30
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,389
gripping the gate them are organized
crime intelligence services and

31
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:57,480
state-sponsored espionage and dusty
always be a nice it's done a

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,418
state-sponsored level and that is about
two percent what they're interested then

33
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:09,269
I am is corporate and industrial
espionage all the normal stuff that you

34
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,680
would expect they're interested
intellectual property they are more and

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,870
more interested in trade secrets

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,150
small things that you can extract
quickly from a network rather than tough

37
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,060
to download the plans for an entire
battleship

38
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,709
it isn't a much better to get the press
release in the battleship isn't going to

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,940
go to sea for another month because of
some sort of delay in and baddest the

40
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,370
country that we that's only one file to
extract rather

41
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,409
all the plans for the battleship so more
interested not the more than two

42
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:48,170
financial markets and market reporting
because they are beginning to hook into

43
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,579
these high frequency trading bots these
horrible things so that if they can get

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,110
PDF all of you don't go to announcements
or where

45
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,200
what is that noise

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,010
there's something new duties laptop is
making a noise i'm sort of as a problem

47
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:12,980
we'll just have to deal with it and help
you might be shot

48
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,409
haha you can never tell with these guys
and happy

49
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,198
so yeah look they're more interested in
this kind of stuff they are going more

50
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,470
and more after critical national
infrastructure I know you all know this

51
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,490
so I'm kind of preaching to the choir
here but pulling it all together and

52
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,360
actually seen it in front of you when
you think about it if you delete from

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,169
corporate and industrial espionage is
intellectual property theft is the next

54
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:39,530
thing

55
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,000
trade secrets man should market
destabilization of a country critical

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,260
national infrastructure general is only
three days worth of bread in the UK

57
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:57,110
three days you could start all the bread
get into the supermarket for three days

58
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,550
you would have riots in this streets

59
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,570
it sure its deadly true

60
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,320
and let's just all that we're all such
makes people that we would never do

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,889
anything like that energy and telemetry
data they're getting more into not right

62
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,260
disruptive technology anything
government military in GA has always

63
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,349
been a big fan of biotechnology underdog
state now do we know about big farm of

64
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,050
the drug state and how much it's worth

65
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,050
yes no

66
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,640
i'll give you but the small version of
it right when they make a drug

67
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,210
if one person doing the drug trial dies

68
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,849
the drug is scrapped so we literally
could be set within them in thousands of

69
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,920
ducks and that's why the cost of
bringing one drug to market is in the

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,970
billions

71
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,880
because if one person dies and they do
one thing wrong in the trials then is

72
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,810
that the window we could be sitting on
top of the cure for cancer because

73
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,490
somebody died in a trial

74
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,220
we're never going to find them so they
go as a rather sobering for have fun

75
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,140
and why financial gain

76
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,340
gdt gdp impact competitive advantage

77
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:29,229
cni destruction - that baggie fixing of
the futures of the energy market notice

78
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,570
the oil price came back up yesterday

79
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:39,219
- 52 but $52 are borrow front down from
a low of 24 and a high of a hundred and

80
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,110
twenty four

81
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:48,340
mmm and somebody had a meeting with the
Democratic Republic of Iran go ask them

82
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,729
nicely to slow that i would have been a
little bit of they could please

83
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,950
yeah all this is going on sectors very
much everything but particularly

84
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:06,750
particularly yeah you know this isn't
being live-streamed isn't it

85
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:14,670
happen I want a thing right so that's
not and no in all seriousness what we

86
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,980
are noticing as a company particularly
leading the stop technology right big

87
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,170
telcos big companies that are working on
new things like Tesla good example

88
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,630
unfortunately we were one of the
companies involved in the taste will

89
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,350
recall

90
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:33,750
so the more people keep on putting i
enjoyed into cars and can all agree that

91
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,260
is a very bad thing and we should be
putting more solid operating systems

92
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,320
like you an excellent choice in that

93
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,650
yeah maybe it runs the Eurofighter runs
an MRI i drive a car with you and exit

94
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,349
over a car with android in any day of
the week

95
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,900
you want to speak to that man there
anything leaving the destructive so

96
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,109
they're going after the star tops just
as much as they are the big bp's and the

97
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,330
SOS and things like that

98
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,200
they're going to take their stuff I at
the same time the level of bpt and the

99
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,760
level of script kitty are becoming to
meet each other and if you want an

100
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:19,229
example of that turkey me caps prime
example asked if he could not do what

101
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:27,419
you can do with me cats three years ago
to do can do notice three commands was

102
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,419
then you see you could

103
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,780
well have a competition later on I'm
hope I did see a train go faster less

104
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:47,180
it's not wash slide ever this is an
american fighter don't know which one

105
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,270
right there 14 or something in 1998
designed by Lockheed Martin the DoD and

106
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,470
NASA

107
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,170
this is the people's republic of congo's
version of the same plane

108
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
I am NOT a fighter pilot

109
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,310
they are the same plane

110
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,370
the unfortunate problem is the people's
republic of angle couldn't get the plane

111
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,980
off the ground because they didn't have
the tooling ability that Lockheed Martin

112
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:28,340
that which made them step up the game
and the game carries on it again

113
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,310
it was able to eventually hear that
right

114
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,939
it's good right it's not right but
initially the first three runs they

115
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,790
couldn't get get off the ground because
of the way the stoop

116
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,860
they couldn't manufacture the steel to
the tolerance which is ironic isn't it

117
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,840
there there bangle seems that was still
know how we got a favor google we've got

118
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,400
the Iranian centrifuges and then really
the whole point the slate is to assure

119
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,970
you that you know it started off from
silly funny things like stealing

120
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,100
people's jet designs and they were up to
CDs stuff that is across every single

121
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:16,520
sector here roughly the figures is a 12
16 billion drug trafficking sex hundred

122
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,300
billion

123
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:25,099
interestingly 5% of what would the g DP
and global cyber activity

124
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,400
I've made a small mistake here because
actually I should move the decimal point

125
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,180
up but as you can see the pretty close
to each other

126
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,719
global celebrity tivity is

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,879
and somewhere where drug trafficking
it's about half of it so not just not

128
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,850
include digital wires

129
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,970
so what's the ecosystem look like well
here is roughly how they do you have a

130
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,839
bag man

131
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,899
that's his job his job is just to spot
you to set and LinkedIn trained you to

132
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,009
sit and look at job I de veras and see
if you got that job trying to figure out

133
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:04,540
what technology stark use trying to
figure out who your Grannis trying to

134
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,599
figure out what charge your mom goes to
anything to create a Dorsey which willow

135
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,750
team e to send a potentially successful
phishing email the bag man

136
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,259
don't really do the initial compromise

137
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,859
once team again with ninety-nine point
nine percent retain my spear phishing

138
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,180
email first thing they go for his
persistence second thing to go for this

139
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,859
week on third and go forward without
expectation and they will be using no

140
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,870
one tools so they will be using things
out a cali that you'd recognize you were

141
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,059
taught your ideas with picking up it
hope things are well protected directing

142
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,829
course

143
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:56,229
favorite throughout the day today pero
tú command control center next time we

144
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:03,459
go up or is the critical assets
financial market data the 840 that then

145
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:09,339
back doors for persistence leave the
command and control computer going close

146
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,089
everything down just go nice and slow
and nice and quiet and wait until the

147
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:17,439
company makes an insolent or you want to
destabilise and do what you want to do

148
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,099
to them

149
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,059
so that's roughly the principal

150
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,750
we can do this one debt quickly

151
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:32,439
it's like teaching going to suck eggs
every I'm company and its supplier be to

152
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:37,569
make my new think my new fancy thing and
then supplier sees going to the building

153
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,329
technique ever any point it gets stolen
the IP guess stolen from these two

154
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,640
places that are weak

155
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,830
because they're part of the integrated
supply chain then Company B gets the

156
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,040
final product first and this happens all
the time

157
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,140
I don't think that it doesn't but it's
not going on every single day with

158
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,890
everything from pharmaceuticals to soft
drinks

159
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,750
ok we doing for time I started guys huh

160
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,340
really can be due to an American guess
it's time

161
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,330
ok cool sweet let's start boarding these
people

162
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:25,650
ok so here's your traditional way of
doing it that you you know you're

163
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,670
walking into the doji company and you
see you're getting all we've got

164
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,420
security because we've got antivirus
always your antivirus do

165
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,770
oh how she's known values of viruses so
they are all

166
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,489
let's all see it together one two three

167
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,850
traveling at all can put it up

168
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,190
i can . and then we can play when you're
done right IP addresses

169
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,240
let's all say it together easy fight
less thing

170
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,290
domain names one two three

171
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,290
yeah I think about it don't let you stop
going to doggie Lee these dark amor

172
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,959
you're actually in this city

173
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,990
maybe that's a load happen

174
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,930
networking Horst artifacts stuff that's
actually being physically put into the

175
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,920
system

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,209
that's where it starts to get annoying
because you can take the mochi how you

177
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,720
can never be a hundred percent sure all
the tools are challenging and I don't

178
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,340
know well as ttp it should see a teepee
see the ATP's of the tough ones because

179
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,950
they are coming in with their own tools

180
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:43,800
let me just go back up sight forgot to
see someone and not having this is

181
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,979
further on

182
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,889
ok so you can see next to that like you
don't use of your first line of defense

183
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:58,560
identification had good justification as
how good your network is this force

184
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,910
defending your there

185
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,139
your network your firewalls and
artifacts are defending you there

186
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,550
the this is the bit where people are
getting into trouble because everybody's

187
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,060
wanting threat intelligence center with
these wanted to have a shock but nobody

188
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,180
actually knows if you ever write
everything had a headache questioner is

189
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,099
anybody here Deitrick that I don't
offend them know myself so I can tell

190
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,190
this right are you f or guy

191
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,120
all right you know those books on you
have always right about the pediments

192
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,680
and you read you need that they've got
11 chapters and you need the first n you

193
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,839
go high the rocks are really beg

194
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,220
how did they move over the rocks and now
I'm only telling you this makes total

195
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,220
sense and the attempt to chapter 11 it
says aliens did it

196
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:51,060
this is the problem we have with threat
intelligence i defy you go get a threat

197
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,000
intelligence book it will tell you what
to look for

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,740
they are tell you how to do better all
that get to the chapter this is I know

199
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,550
what do they do with all the shit
totally bike

200
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,430
nobody figured that one out yet so you
get a good early warning system you need

201
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,540
a tacit alerting you need decent stock
services and these people need to be

202
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,699
talking to each other and a constant
basis physically talking not just

203
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:28,139
well done you can install spunk kind of
talking right here is actually an

204
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,220
example of one of the exploits that we
had that want to talk to you about

205
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,220
as you can see all the eye peas and
vangel

206
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:43,850
all right command and control centers
and vinyl thats its dns exfiltration no

207
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,510
it's not right they don't exist struck
out your head against them i would be

208
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,130
enough in our happen and that's pretty
much how are you - good

209
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,080
let me do show you the remediation
because it's quite a nice graph and it

210
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,870
kind of puts it into context

211
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,280
this took six months and cost the boat

212
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,589
seven million plants so you know when
you read the newspapers

213
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,678
it's a 10 million pone remediation or 10
million pound hack and it's going to

214
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,470
take nine months to fix

215
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:28,220
here's why . the house right

216
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,580
the attackers end and availability

217
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,939
Shuki dro efficacy doesn't exist in our
understanding the attack is that Taylor

218
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:48,800
or turquoise lying there we leave them
in the system after where people don't

219
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,809
get that why you leave them in assists

220
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,899
oh yeah rajuk catch a bad guy

221
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,390
did you know what the 11 less you can
snoop about and check and see whether do

222
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,820
believe in the system as we leave them
in the system we discover more about

223
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,200
their methodologies

224
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,270
sometimes the clock or nickname o'clock
in the morning and five o'clock at night

225
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,450
and vine in vinyl

226
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,740
I'm two hundred and then the only take
van Gogh national holidays

227
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,390
I was still a coif you the great country

228
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,779
once we've got to this point we know
what is our controls we need we know

229
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:35,230
what we need to start thinking about
doing but we can't do it quite yet

230
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,259
because their end

231
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:42,759
and they've got the back door as the
understanding improves based on all the

232
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:48,730
investigation the analysis and second
till I can find the UP button

233
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,580
it's a person that do to our lack of
understanding of what he's doing

234
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,899
I was not telling her or how he's doing
it

235
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,039
notice how the lines cross at this point
as we figured out what he's done the

236
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,749
controls that improved the more we can
understand about the hacker other one we

237
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:17,409
can leave them in the system the better
more efficacious we can meet the

238
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,450
controls that we put in place

239
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,730
improvements to the controls reduce the
attackers mobility so we start to box

240
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,149
the men but not so much that they think
they've been caught because then it's my

241
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:36,459
favorite better practice these active
course they do

242
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,159
and buying

243
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,989
that's the point of remediation that is
a weekend

244
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:52,779
no jokin whole company will be done in a
weekend

245
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,639
this is sex once planning leaving them
active gathering information about them

246
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,668
figured out of work where they're coming
from figuring out what tools they use in

247
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:05,320
figuring out what how we need to be
ready our rule set all I can enough and

248
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,210
then we'll actually we will kick them
out over the weekend or one of angles

249
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,760
many qualities

250
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,940
I'm boy did they ever surprised when
they got back to work on Monday the

251
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,750
remediation takes place quickly at two
to prevent a change in tactics

252
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,000
based on the financial impact either the
network of the cerebral access is

253
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,900
limited changes to the architecture play
this is a rock music is not rocket

254
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,130
science to you guys and . network
visibility must be in place or their

255
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,360
logins and play systems partly beltram
idiot remediated maybe is it new AV

256
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,010
signatures

257
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,270
you may as well have them for all the
good that area all controls are turned

258
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,830
up monitored aggressively

259
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,840
I would not start going into this that
someone's been spearfish then it's

260
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,199
probably time to the minimum bet money
and stopped raining

261
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:06,480
no more steady stick of operations we
are at the top here or working fine

262
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,540
they have been kept oh but the other and
advanced persistent threat to future

263
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,310
activities that was a terrible we can
quickly respond to them because the

264
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,110
slate I was trying to famed for you and
I'm almost done so if you give me a

265
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:31,199
second to find the bag man slide eagle
right ft me is kicked her out that point

266
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,970
of remediation that we saw

267
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,630
Team B or swing into action

268
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,830
that's what a persistent but comes in
Team B other guys that are older

269
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,239
the other guys that you know when you
hear guys that right now we're an

270
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,020
assembly

271
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,230
you know my god - no smiling at him and
saying you do so yes well done happen

272
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,800
nobody else in this room guy how so

273
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,060
yeah that's what team media does and of
course just to finish out the

274
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,960
presentation

275
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,710
figure 8 through the end of it but of
course the regulation as if there's any

276
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,700
team and it flows at B team

277
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:16,520
what's the obvious question I'll come on
think about her force

278
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:25,730
there's an ATM there's a BTM so is there
are sea team yeah and end people's

279
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,140
democratic republic of languor they're
married to each other and they are

280
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,419
considered military assets

281
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm not joking the habitat account

282
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,540
I can show it to you so that's basically
mediation and basic ideas which I make a

283
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,260
bit of fun

284
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,929
I'm not going through the boarding
government stuff and stuff and like that

285
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:45,559
with you

286
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:49,610
are there any questions of trading
makers enjoy the kind for the end today

287
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,809
yes sir make it easy please I'm tired

288
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,240
yeah

289
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:12,260
it would depend through the are right if
the turn out to be they see the Russian

290
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,190
mafia

291
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:19,220
they know . and writing a letter to the
Russian police have to be a egg

292
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,220
we we work for the client right

293
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,150
we have phoned nation-state terrorists
script kiddies

294
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,610
anonymous see you later agencies in
places right

295
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,480
and if that happens we pick up the form
where before number how many should you

296
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,350
really be there a sort of sorts of some
kind of you know thing going on that we

297
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,159
don't know about

298
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,450
otherwise you've got 48 hours with about
to meet you at the system link in their

299
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,720
cells back and it's not a problem

300
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:02,330
that was harsh doesn't burst reality if
you had yeah yeah that sounds great yeah

301
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,710
go for the seconds

302
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,290
the c team i can assure you they seem

303
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,850
uh-huh

304
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:23,540
their blasters and angle right okay yeah
yeah

305
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,370
because the a team will be using script
kiddie tools out to a higher level way

306
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,449
there'll be mass . and stuff and things
like that but it won't just be hurtin

307
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:38,210
Armitage you know they will know how to
do you will notice the B team by the

308
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,510
network traffic and then eventually are
fighting their binary and you'll notice

309
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,530
that the binaries have been handwritten
right and then the answer to your

310
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,920
question is the c team as one level of
craftiness above that it's even harder

311
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,790
to find is even more obvious cated is
even Lord is even slower

312
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,910
yeah

313
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:07,330
any more questions if it is everything
better assembly i can only do your ex or

314
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,810
not I can do you mind as well but you

315
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,630
yes sir

316
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,440
well that's why i said education to be
on a strike is Mike

317
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:40,570
yep yep and it's crap

318
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,730
yes crap they do this if they do it for
pure tokenism had to be the right how do

319
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,750
we make it more bus

320
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,000
well I watched an education for 10 years
so the chicky answers you employ me to

321
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,730
write your security software security
training program for your company and

322
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,560
deliver and a bespoke manner

323
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,950
the other thing that we do is we do
constant checking and people right

324
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,340
people turn up to how many times you
been to a new job done the health is key

325
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,350
thing and then never done it again

326
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:15,070
alright so screen should be locked down
once or twice question should be asked

327
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,909
he should be warned once or twice
they're going to get internally freshed

328
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:26,080
then on the fourth time we should be
warmed and if we still have 400 people

329
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,240
and that link we failed and we need to
look at it from different angles so that

330
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,530
that's the way I look at it get a
baseline bring the baseline dough

331
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:45,190
you can literally put into calls out
figures and sitting watching CEOs and

332
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,670
boardrooms when you actually give them
the money that's that's that's the way

333
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,110
that that's the way again

334
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:57,399
sure anything else no no no comments no
and with different angle want to sue me

335
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,309
just now

336
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,240
that's exactly what I'm going to do
buddy Sally well noted that i sold

337
