1
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,870
I'm very excited to share my research

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,780
view thank you for inviting me and in
this presentation I'm going to talk

3
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,110
about creating all the various be the
tighter is better yet to be but this is

4
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,900
a kind of tour for state testing

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:44,960
yes i'm a secret researcher app NSR of
south korea and i'm also on operating

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,620
system and for multiple of her and then
also all the luxury is titled 64-bit

7
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,580
working core is Prince of purse and
structure sporting one and for them to

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,120
you can find these books at amazon

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:10,100
yes and my name is , <time> five </time>
in English and additionally uh I like a

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,780
very much so if you have any question
about this presentation feel free to

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,880
email me or ask to me

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,259
yes mmm this is the content screen

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,290
first I will tell you of background of
my research and I our height secondary

14
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,130
show you how you have a portable charger
with iron height

15
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,789
third we show you how you use or have to
put over each other and finally I show

16
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,560
some interesting stuff

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,110
background of my research i do know him

18
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,950
no transformer at Crystal group

19
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,670
now why don't I talk

20
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,799
thank you do that

21
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,729
yes the project name is came from his
name

22
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,640
I are Heidi's on weapons specialist and
supports his brand of these weapons my

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,970
project I on haight can support to you
like him

24
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,900
I are hide is basically on human
interface device for making your own

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:30,730
tours human interface device hid its
supported from PCs to smartphones and

26
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,720
hid does not need a specific device
driver

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
these are strengths of the hid device

28
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,590
I on Hyde is based on hid

29
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,400
but I or hide the candy another type so
USB such as a mass storage i will

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
explain this later

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:59,290
I are high the features it has a custom
device a forum where our test agent

32
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,440
program and on android smartphone
program it can exploit various types of

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,900
systems such as . upset as you know our
systems pieces and androids it is

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,390
lightweight embedded hardware paste

35
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,690
i unhide you just two kinds of embedded
hardware

36
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,850
re no and TC the important thing is that
I on Heidi is an open source project

37
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,250
so if you want to make or hag occupies
just started with iron height here is

38
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,030
the ring

39
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,480
of iron I project now i'm preparing the
source code of of police

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,600
therefore be released in a couple of
days

41
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:58,610
this page shows the feature of our Dino
and pc2 boards are most popular and low

42
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,790
power to invade the hardware and they
have a convenient ID for programming as

43
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,019
not a sketch

44
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:14,150
are they know is larger than TC put more
powerful than 10 C so therefore Arduino

45
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:21,048
is suitable for hacking raj and complex
devices things is very smaller so it is

46
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,239
suitable for hacking smart devices

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,030
this is simple diagram of iron
architecture

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,380
Ironhide has three parts first parties

49
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,229
custom device which is on the center of
the page

50
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:43,520
the custom device is composed of
embedded hardware and wireless

51
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,479
communication majors custom devices are
attached onto commercial devices such as

52
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,140
portable chargers card readers and
keepers the device which I are these are

53
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,260
attached on to become approach device
the process device is in charge of

54
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,860
making our channel between commander
program and test station program second

55
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,010
parties are test station program which
is on the right side of the page at the

56
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:23,930
testing program have a custom device to
dive into opposes demand a pc the custom

57
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,810
device is the test page and program
inside and in stores into the posts and

58
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,229
the pc the last two parties

59
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,570
commander program which is on the left
side of the page and the commander

60
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,190
program has interface for you and
controls the custom device

61
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,628
fire wireless connections you can use
all functions so I are not using the

62
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,599
commander program

63
00:05:53,599 --> 00:06:00,498
this is detailed diagram of Hyde
architecture in your smartphone

64
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:07,009
I are not commander is learning and you
can execute to share commands and

65
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:11,749
keyboard event capture screens and fire
it fires from the target system

66
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:21,649
the commander sends the request to the
cost twenty rice the custom device has

67
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:27,409
three parts from error on embedded
hardware and on the wireless module

68
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:32,899
Ironhide for me or is a core part with
custom device

69
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:39,409
it takes charge of USD function support
it transports recast show up with the

70
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:44,839
commander to the target system and
transported back to the commander

71
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,930
the formula has hid device

72
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,639
sorry hid function and mass storage
function it has a cd-rom image for

73
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,569
installing the test agent program into
target assistance

74
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:05,990
the test test agent program takes charge
your processing recast rubber tire hide

75
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,139
yes last type into the eye on height

76
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,699
I alright former has one input type and
the points for sending and logging

77
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:23,300
keyboard events and it has to berk tag
and the points for installing the test

78
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,469
agent program

79
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:29,808
it also has one contour type and the
point for making a channel between the

80
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:38,029
test agent program and the commander
program to us to note 2 and the points

81
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,159
with 10 points

82
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,248
No

83
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:54,769
miss the end appointees for sure device
to communicate each other

84
00:07:54,769 --> 00:08:06,799
so you you think the you think the
future devices

85
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:13,609
yes oh yeah if you have catch on about
this please ask me later

86
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,679
yes mmm

87
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,620
the testing program processes strike
commands fire command line chef for the

88
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,090
Emperor cmd.exe whereas it processes
screen captures and for transfers are

89
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,909
you said Eugen Systems api's the
commander has a contractor for managing

90
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:43,979
Ironhide status command and commanded to
have for sending commands and keyword

91
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,860
test for sending a login keyboard events
this task can be used for finding secret

92
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
horse of our systems

93
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,970
i will show this later and here is the
protocol of ir hide

94
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,480
I are hide the unit simple protocol for
communicating each component if you want

95
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,420
to add new feature or higher haha or
improve upon one so by all right

96
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,959
trains your rebuild this protocol

97
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,450
now

98
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,949
oh we are ready to launch and choose a
target to attach it

99
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:35,400
yes you know everyone wants portable
charger you use we use so it's not upon

100
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,959
and the path everywhere and we spend so
much time with them but you know it

101
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,939
doesn't have enough battery for you so
you should bring your own charger or

102
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,970
maybe you should to find out red and
keep your enemies

103
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:04,949
yes so there are so many portable
chargers in the word you should buy one

104
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:12,480
of them for your smart for life and
there are so many preventive services

105
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
for you

106
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:25,300
mmm wait a second you're totally being
your Potter's harder in your hand or on

107
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,349
your desk and your desktop on your desk

108
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,640
power shock power shop is the thing that
blow you up

109
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:45,520
it is a portable charger but not normal
because it has I on hide inside it it

110
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,540
can test

111
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:53,469
android smartphones post systems and
your pc's it is a maybe probably weapon

112
00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:04,330
for penetration testers the nexus
Debbie's hacking a portable charger for

113
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,570
disassembling the portable charger used
to prepare some tours such as efficient

114
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,350
tapes

115
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,670
drivers can set a soldier and soldiering
iron vapor and a tester

116
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,329
you do not need to prepare all these
tourists but if you prepare them you can

117
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,810
they can have you to serve your problems

118
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:37,750
why are you two celebrating the portable
charger DC star inside of a portable

119
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,150
charger

120
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:47,470
sorry yes I'm sure I don't know program
n

121
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:57,790
sorry i didn't know that there are many
kinds of any kind of put over each other

122
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,180
but they have almost the same
architecture like this

123
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,510
there are

124
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,510
only a charger motor and battery stairs

125
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,590
the only difference between lo capo and
high-capacity mother is the number of

126
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:24,050
the three cells if you have a high
capacity mother congratulate you can put

127
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:31,609
many things in your portable charger my
portable charger got four batteries

128
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:40,640
yes so let's make some space for
Ironhide battery stairs in the portable

129
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,040
charger are connected in parallel

130
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,880
therefore the portal which other works
fine if you cut off some battery says

131
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,260
like this

132
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:58,970
it's fine the power portable charger
will decrease but the mind you will get

133
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,970
another power soon just club them

134
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:11,469
this is P layouts up a charter board
basically portable charger has more than

135
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,250
two parts one is for recharging yourself

136
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,880
others are for charging smartphones or
path in this picture the leopard party

137
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,980
is for recharging

138
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:33,459
so it is connected with the pc if you
attach Ironhide on to this port you can

139
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:41,859
access the target system directory the
right to parties first not phone and if

140
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,250
you attach I all right onto this that
part

141
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:54,190
you can also access the smartphone the
USB port has four or five pins and pin

142
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,339
sequence is very important if you don't
know peen sequence you can find it from

143
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,720
the data sheet

144
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,060
we are always for data leave this is to
take a shit

145
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:15,699
yeah these are three types of us
connectors micro type and a type and me

146
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:19,660
type you can find the pin she comes from
this picture

147
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,920
yes number one number five

148
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,800
this may be two three four yeah we see
and ground almost same

149
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:42,248
if you analyzed the portable charger and
you make custom device of Ironhide ir hi

150
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:47,499
this is composed of one in very hardware
and on wireless communication majors

151
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:56,919
this is a TC and Brutus per channel by
on haight TC has an eye on things he has

152
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,559
a hardware motor for sheer
communications and TC and Brutus module

153
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:10,478
communicated through this year protocol
director picture shows p layout so of 10

154
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:21,369
c3200 Eckstein or pc receive data from
the British culture and that the 3 PX pn

155
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:26,679
sense they tattoo the breakfast module
the right the picture shows to play

156
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:34,179
outside the British merger and every
breath to smolder has its only a layout

157
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:46,209
but it really has four important paint
which are bc ground TX and RX for

158
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:55,059
communication between teams en route to
support connection 32 our experiment NC

159
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:03,639
to the TSP noble Roger and that this
week to XP of T C to the art scene of

160
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,659
the motor

161
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,899
yes

162
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,110
you can

163
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:19,769
the collection here and you finally got
the power

164
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,970
this is the power shock your sander the
portable charger and testing if it works

165
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,749
fine

166
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:34,230
the right to feature shows that the
original function of my portable charger

167
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,790
charging function

168
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,649
yes works fine by the way you are not
ready

169
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:48,779
yep a unit one more team the thing is
autumn's cable

170
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,939
this is 40 cable

171
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,649
it activates the USB host the function
of smartphones

172
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,529
therefore you can kind of the various
types of USB for the first such as

173
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:08,789
keyboard USB drives and carburetors

174
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,059
this is the final piece of the puzzle

175
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:21,299
you can easily by the Ortiz cable from
online stores but we have one problem

176
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,689
they have a female connector

177
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,689
therefore if you connect to

178
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,949
if you want to connect power shock to
your smartphone

179
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,720
you should use additional work married
to Mary capers

180
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:45,779
so this is the picture which shows what
you do it's not the phone and power

181
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:49,680
shock and capers

182
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,830
and connections

183
00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:01,770
actually I don't want to have many
cables so let's make your custom party

184
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:10,410
caber for reducing the number of papers
making a custom which carries very

185
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:19,860
simple you just December cable and
sorter IDP number four and ground p

186
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,120
number five

187
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:31,590
after that the assembler a caber and go
to the next step the next step is

188
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,760
testing a vulnerability of its not fun
using power shack

189
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,620
as you know there was a pin boner
ability which clothes on or take her to

190
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,649
the first spin on you to really listen
to android smartphones already patched

191
00:18:52,650 --> 00:19:01,230
the vulnerability but it's not for us to
have it is not fun also have anything at

192
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:11,580
this is the way that you check the
ability of smartphone commonly in

193
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:18,720
android has a time constant function to
prevent an attacker from 4 to 14 pins

194
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:28,470
but Philip Ian's in this case better pin
could be stillborn upper let's follow

195
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:38,550
the flow diagram you can use pattern
lock and you said gotta pee and you can

196
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,460
type the head up be non-negative early

197
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,260
you are totally dangerous in other case

198
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,560
you are baby safe but don't be my words

199
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,380
you know the attackers are finding
vulnerabilities to defeat your

200
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:02,360
smartphone's if you find a pinch runner
ability in your smartphone

201
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,990
yes connect power shark to the
smartphone with art each caper then

202
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,450
power shark first forces playing
automatically you can send pins

203
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,690
it was at no sorry i quickly

204
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:25,400
yes so if someone asks you to charge
their smart phones you gradually charged

205
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,420
with power shock and you are not the
smartphone

206
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:38,540
yes there were time you wait for a long
time

207
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,550
then we show our two videos about power
shack one thing is about people force

208
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:56,210
and the other thing is hidden manna
tester pc is the input first video where

209
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,210
a second

210
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:09,980
and call it

211
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,250
before testing configure your lock
screen lock lock screen patterns first

212
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:32,990
sorry throw and throw pattern again and
set up have a little pin type in again

213
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,640
and now

214
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:49,480
try it on patterns intentionally to
enter the developing called wrong

215
00:21:50,020 --> 00:22:00,730
yes the back up in menu is activated and
now you can type the letter P test if

216
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:12,340
you can tie pins unlimitedly yes i can
type the pin on the admittedly without

217
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:26,168
time-consuming function so plug the
power shot into smartphone and then it

218
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:37,929
was first is beans automatically after a
while it's not funny are locked and it

219
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:39,549
is finish it

220
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:47,918
yeah this is a simple video which shows
how to use power shop but this is a very

221
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,000
famous video and more

222
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,600
everyone tried to force pienso so I
prepared the next video

223
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,459
- next video series

224
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,080
hidden a tester oh wait a second

225
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,030
this is hidden manna tester

226
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,440
yes

227
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,220
for testing plug power stroke into a an
android multiple first

228
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:49,220
and now power shock is activated the ion
hide commanders and their long commands

229
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,770
for stocking hidden manna tester

230
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,830
i untied enters various hidden menu
commands for different manufacturers for

231
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,850
the Emperor

232
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:07,429
samsung LG cougar and STC and

233
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:23,770
i unhide also enters various hidden menu
commands for different mobile operators

234
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,490
for the temporary AT&T Verizon and
t-mobile

235
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,100
yeah yes

236
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,100
finally you've got to see the menu if
the test was finished i unhide

237
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,860
automatically notifies commander fire in
air SMS and so on

238
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,439
in this case the email yes

239
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:05,080
ok and complete for a wire

240
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,639
you've got an email from power shock and
you can see the message from her hide

241
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,820
ok let's go back to the presentation

242
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:34,570
additionally i unhide has the table or
the healing command so if you want to

243
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,580
change or as some hidden class

244
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,730
you added the fire

245
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,750
oh I am hard and change or add something
in Tabor's

246
00:25:48,679 --> 00:26:03,019
ah ok the next baby is testing up on
ability or the post system and the pc

247
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:12,769
mmm essentially one pc based upon system
using a iPad or an Android pet tab are

248
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:20,029
increasing but pc-based post systems
still has a lot of personal market share

249
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:30,110
you know a pc-based per system is just a
pc therefore they also have many kinds

250
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,149
of our reports like this

251
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:38,779
USBS brands share ports our airports and
ps2 ports

252
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:46,070
hmm if you can plug power shark into the
post system

253
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:52,789
what did happen to eat we can do

254
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:57,408
interesting behaviors like a testing
vulnerabilities or gain control just for

255
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,049
fun and so on

256
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:08,179
if the post system has a vulnerability
such as zero more USB altar on the test

257
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:12,830
station program is installed into the
post system via cydia function of our

258
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,710
hide if the post system has no wear on
your abilities

259
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,909
there is no problem you can start the
test station program

260
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,899
I sending keyboard events for example

261
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:34,699
open menu using the combination of
window key and our key and execute the

262
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,909
test station program by sending she
caused such as the current / test asian

263
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:49,759
that exe their time again

264
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,119
let me show one video about Porsha pcs
post system test video

265
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,080
wait a second

266
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:19,010
yes the left side of the video has a
wider view and show the testing sequence

267
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,090
and the right side of the video for
courses on

268
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,659
Ironhide commander for testing

269
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:34,640
plug power shocked into the post system
and now partially is activated on my own

270
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:46,490
hide commander and connect to power
shack with Brutus network is connected

271
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:54,710
after that you can send various commands
and keyboard events using commander

272
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,610
program

273
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:05,060
now you send mount command to power
shock then mount the CD rom to the poor

274
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,179
system if the post system has
vulnerabilities

275
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:17,780
you can get the sharepoint ideas if you
can get your point

276
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:24,260
you can explore explore the rockers I
system or a list of running processes

277
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:30,379
spy list and

278
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:45,559
task list you can see the test agent
that exe process at least over over over

279
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:59,899
there as and now someone orders foods
and fever reaches then pay with his

280
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,899
credit card

281
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:17,820
mhm and the card number is displayed on
the screen at this time you snap the

282
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:28,919
screen by sending a catcher command and
the capture d me can be sent out the

283
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:36,420
test agent program is sending a screen
image and after a while

284
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,680
just a moment

285
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:49,950
ok come from the transport image

286
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:04,629
and you want to execute a local program
and keyboard events using the commander

287
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:23,140
program and window key and our key to
open the menu and said no to pad and

288
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,600
enter

289
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,129
now you can see you're not a program at
the left side

290
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:40,290
say hello to the clock - 42 slower so
you cannot see the message but I'm how

291
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,760
do we taking it

292
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:53,520
hello TC is Ironhide and enter

293
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:01,710
yes finished and keeping one to get a
fire

294
00:32:02,509 --> 00:32:08,839
Sam Donald command using commander
program in this case

295
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,839
download custom earliest file

296
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,918
I'm are so how do we typing it

297
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:28,490
customer least to file

298
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,610
ok

299
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:40,789
typing is complete and the fire is
transferred

300
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,250
ok come from the transport fire

301
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,990
you can see the information

302
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:59,059
wait in it yes ok

303
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,428
the final families and it let's go back
to the presentation

304
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:18,260
yeah

305
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:30,320
this is balls pages i think i have so
much time to explain this so i think i

306
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,340
should explain

307
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:40,340
mmm the plan spaces are about keyboard
shock and either shock you have an

308
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,280
inkling pcs leader shock

309
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,899
yes I know I wasted my precious capers

310
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,280
but i want you to look like how to core

311
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,100
how do I a hacker like others and you
know how to call how to how do we have

312
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,209
cars does not stay

313
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:08,000
they kept their capers anyway we were
shocked has I on hide inside it and i

314
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,960
unhide it walks like a keyboard attached
Ironhide onto us to the keyboards and

315
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,000
keep them to your car keys

316
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,960
the more expensive the better for making
keyboard shock

317
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,879
you should to find out k matrix orbiter
keyboard

318
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:37,069
each keyboard has its own key matrix and
you can find it using our test erectus

319
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:47,330
touch one lead of the tester to a pad of
our kids reach and touch another lead to

320
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,850
pass or controller here and here

321
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,720
if they are connected

322
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:04,850
you can hear the pitch sound deep and
then you can find the four matrix of the

323
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,779
keyboard

324
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,780
yeah this is the matrix

325
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:15,419
in source code of iron hide it had
already three kinds of he keep all the

326
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,630
matrix for making your own keyboard
shack find the matrix and just change

327
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:31,320
the matrix configuration in the source
code and this is readership leadership

328
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,609
is very simpler

329
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:41,400
you just sold our Ironhide and USB port
of the card readers key or so either

330
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,790
shot to your car keys and then

331
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,610
you become more familiar with them

332
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,940
you can show who you are

333
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,300
by sending some special command such as
for mercy drive which q open the most

334
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:06,400
part and you can say hello to your
colleagues by sending some keyboard

335
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,590
events whenever you want

336
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,590
hi hello it's me are you doing blahblah

337
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:19,839
and you can understand them deeply by
snapping their screens are catching the

338
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,400
application schedule 5

339
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:28,090
if you are lucky you can go on vacation
with your carcass and Surprise them

340
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,210
try it and let me know your argument

341
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:41,500
this page shows resource is iron height

342
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,380
Ironhide has many parts and they
utilized this hardware and software

343
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,420
I extend my thanks to them thank you

344
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:06,190

coming oh I'm afraid

345
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,580

346
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,730

349
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:29,030
please keep America II as i mentioned
i'm preparing the source code of iron

350
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,750
height so our it'll be released soon

351

immediately please email me or watch my

352
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,500

ah is I understand you

356
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:20,589
yeah I really i should show the
architecture diagram the screenshot

357
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:28,150
sends from the test agent program

358
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:35,260
so the test agent program capture the
screen and save the pyre and then send

359
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,869
to iron high commander

360
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:47,770
so you can see the screenshot in your
smartphone or path that as your question

361
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,520
great any further questions

362
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,500

firmware for the teensy already are

363
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500

brought any firmware already just choose

367
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:29,130
their ordinary sketches from where they
are doing your dirty ncsoft hardware

368
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,220
so did you just for use the ordinary
sketch

369
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,000
I writing ability or did you rewrite any
firmware

370
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:47,190
ok you mean I used the only sketch or
something some or some tourists for

371

maybe tomorrow yeah

376
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:33,420
at me at me yeah so i use you step out
the source code and I made my form error

377
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,420
from sketch from scratch

378
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,789
mmm right on the other hand is questions
right here

379
00:40:47,789 --> 00:40:53,640
do you have any plans at a moment's to
to write a custom payload as an

380
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,180
extension for iron Heights so you could
trigger and may display before shell or

381
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,078
something

382
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:13,380
ok our good question i have to plan that
I real at the function that commander

383
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:26,579
send the payload to the test agent
program so maybe three or four months

384
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,749
later the function will be added

385
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:34,769
just watch my tweeter and project

386
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:40,919
