1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,730
- the money

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,830
and

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:27,080
thank you boil in trees in our research
being the following are where we are

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,098
present

5
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,140
how to attack and restore were when the
bigger timing signalled

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,460
during this presentation where these
costs the and Peter were it's the bottom

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,280
model the reference clock

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:01:01,449
how to put becoming thinking on and how
to attack and Peter were normally we can

9
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:10,298
set and peace over for our computer to
synchronize time out magically sometime

10
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:21,850
our mobile phone also get it time for my
and Peter were these taps and preserver

11
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,780
is educated with our daily level

12
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:38,619
ntp servers are also widely used in
private networks that help our grades

13
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:48,459
and the real wave for example potpourri
have to synchronize their automatic

14
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:58,989
equipment in less than 10 millisecond as
we know our computer or phone can get

15
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:07,330
it's time for my NP summer but how does
then Keith over get its time

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,629
well according to in the end p protocol
to draw them level was the plane that

17
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:30,179
these things from the computer to in the
reference clock and reference clock is

18
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,799
as random download you is that is
accurate and the highly toe or no delay

19
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:52,920
associated the way they did random
little OT wise cannot be Yoda and then

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,328
to work

21
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,959
I think that they are directly connected
to life

22
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,959
random one entry server

23
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:12,090
i speared him along and be server X as
their primary time that time summer it

24
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,090
gets it's time for my reference clock

25
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,889
namely to them they'll be wise

26
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:29,910
ice cream as freedom to there were
either connected to ice cream in one

27
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,139
hour

28
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:40,410
oh we're at network pass last I threw
them too

29
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:48,418
there were get its time by sending ntp
pack the request for mice problem tool

30
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,180
that were and this up

31
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,190
I speed of those three separate cat it's
time for my to do them to sever and the

32
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,090
storm

33
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:08,639
so they are working more time sauce is
the reference clock in this presentation

34
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:17,880
we will discuss the reference clock and
their rhythm 1 and T server

35
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:28,600
well L this picture here old a lot of
mato and these are words I employ the

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:38,800
way that they open source and if you
working for some of the world from the

37
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,460
newest ntp working for source code

38
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,448
we know that and be working for support

39
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,680
almost bought the island types of
reference clock

40
00:04:51,639 --> 00:05:00,520
the most common seal that are the WWE it
be that they have learned is there one

41
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:17,770
dy m SF and keep yes but white on a
stream 13 server use the radio clock and

42
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:26,859
the TBS as a reference clock in fact
they are three classes at all accurate

43
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,860
clock the atomic clock

44
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,770
gps and the radio clock the atomic clock
is a memory accurate but if the pen to

45
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,960
the gps satellite has that building

46
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:54,190
atomic clock and the broader constant
they time all this atomic clock needs

47
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:06,280
navigation data frame the timing to
ignore our reference clock is also

48
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,280
controlled

49
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,710
you also can call the bank at home
o'clock the hallways that their

50
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:24,880
broadcasts all native while he's timing
thinking all we can use that locals

51
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,610
everything were to get almost the theme
accurate time as atomic clock the radio

52
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,790
clock and the TPS have been widely yield
to be odd to treat more and keep the

53
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,750
server

54
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,480
well and there

55
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,300
NP website there's at least four it's
supported radio clock and the gps

56
00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:01,120
receiver cause we can connect that with
regard to a computer to PR dies with

57
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:12,400
them along and there were very easily
and that they are also a lot your amount

58
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,090
of integrating the Supreme One and mr.
world that can be selectively for

59
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,010
industry old taking this product as an
example from its broad part description

60
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,800
we know that support TF don't get there
one

61
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,410
msf WWE B and BS every reference clock

62
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:46,300
now let's talk about how to 40 they
timing signalled

63
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:58,460
our aim into t ly I uniform dedicated to
trans meet all these radio clock signal

64
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:12,469
first let me introduce their thinking of
picture they wo wo would be timing radio

65
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:21,589
taking it operated by the UFA according
to eat to a encoding making them is your

66
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:30,649
different paths the wives to river and
different binary data feeds and this

67
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:43,099
church shoe if we amplitude either
reduce the for eight hundred millisecond

68
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:53,120
and the bank increase that by 200
millisecond they see you then mounted

69
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:03,439
special feat which we called have a
marker if its amplitude is reduced for

70
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:07,279
500 millisecond length

71
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,029
increase the x 500 millisecond

72
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,380
they think that data people with their
well you want

73
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:25,009
if it's the amplitude is reduce the poor
200 millisecond

74
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:28,610
thank you sit by eight hundred
millisecond

75
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:39,410
this is that they beat when their value
little and then the WWE would be Tammy

76
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,969
thinking or used a safety

77
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,970
hello has care

78
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,740
after eating the thing not to the
carrier with the amplitude received King

79
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,190
modulating if they interesting nor will
add a la la

80
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,570
it's a trying to meet the way we reduced
amplitude and when they in putting in or

81
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,010
Richard hi

82
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:23,120
it's a 20-metre whale for amplitude they
output of these things cause repellent

83
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:33,500
that ate the canary repeats marker one
they know and the one of the things the

84
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,480
one ring at the start already need each
brain can see it's all stakes of T beads

85
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:52,190
if the twins meets one piece per second
that ring start aways and marker be and

86
00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:02,660
almost ends and marker Pete every 10
mins take every time second to reduce

87
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,500
error

88
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:15,320
egypt for any contains the means are
year they are mere and the weaker

89
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
they all week

90
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:28,330
the panel peed also either marker so if
everything would get to stick with your

91
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,030
marker repeat it means that a new free
me prepared to be resumed

92
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,680
well they could you wire it you're
taking you operate the pie and a

93
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,060
campaign

94
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,300
it's the encoding Maggie them is a very
similar to the wwp the difference

95
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
between them

96
00:11:50,620 --> 00:12:00,670
I the different pathways of each Pete
and the different frame in Coney it also

97
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,410
your neck safety

98
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,410
crow has care

99
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:16,900
DTF 70 71 is operated by Cameron the
company in fact it's all so similar

100
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:31,780
ww-p exactly it's the old a 77 1.5 kilo
has career as we make it before the

101
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,939
career all do I

102
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:42,970
ww-wait be and the msf r6000 has wild
ATF 77 way you 70

103
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,969
since then . the final co-head we want
to t that I uniform taking it to keep

104
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:58,330
about of transmitting all the air
poverty clock signal so we use that

105
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:09,730
against module to generate career 50s
module can retire little 240 make her

106
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:18,850
hands away and the RT know there's an
open source driver it to make the whole

107
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,270
thing

108
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,270
I'll eat either

109
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:33,388
that the more you very simple taking the
video is an example when thinking marker

110
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:41,730
beat it will require thinking the camera
. to second of four amplitude follow the

111
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,809
pie .

112
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:51,749
eight-second reduce the amplitude in
this case . it requires you to reduce

113
00:13:51,749 --> 00:14:04,980
amplitude justice you have time that it
is module when thinking the pic one

114
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:14,069
it will require the carrier . 5 seconds
of your attitude and follow the pie .

115
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:17,069
five-second reduce the empty dude

116
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:33,059
on their radio clock signal like WWE be
is the f 77 1 also can be implemented

117
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:43,860
with this way I get in this marriage
lipstick and dinner for my video wide

118
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,649
receiver module in fact this engineer
yield adding doctor

119
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
well connected with the proper capacity
in parallel

120
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,550
it can be used to transmit eat the 50
Cal ahead carrier when we want to try

121
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:10,589
and meet they guarantee their 1.50 has
kura you have to change to another

122
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,499
capacitor

123
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:23,550
they think the whole key to all the
young form 20-metre we don't yield any

124
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,829
empathy for our hair

125
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:34,829
it's a very simple you also can play
we'd if you want to try to meet over

126
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,949
long these things just 28 that power

127
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,639
mp4 and that began to know better
because ball of breaking the law

128
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:55,739
now they talked to Harry Reid o'clock in
the prepared and let how she feel how to

129
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
for gps ignore

130
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,560
but for me

131
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:15,170
oh thanks to you is introduced to the
GUI bird and apologize to our present

132
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:26,000
and so let me introduce how to attack on
TSN TV receiver so as you can see a ntp

133
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,810
server sir

134
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,959
cross-references not just heyy bird or
something else and mostly we will use

135
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,500
the past 30 chip to be a signal to a
receiver

136
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,949
so we were introduced the best of times
both in taking this waste and in detail

137
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,230
so firstly we will talk about the most
common to be as receivers and that we

138
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,370
were used and we can buy in China and
there are in order to make you guys

139
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,490
understand the words the meaning of the
source code which is right and we will

140
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,579
briefly introduce the best text
principal and our generate a real gps

141
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,579
signal to both the hour

142
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,439
divots receiver bird that we just about
it was just about and going to have a

143
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,100
try

144
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,459
and what is this attempt

145
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:25,280
we will still have some jerk Romans into
and the way and you cannot ignore them

146
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,660
so we're going to introduce how to
upgrade our to be a signal generating

147
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,490
generating a clear

148
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:40,550
so let's started and so here it's the
two guys receiver that we can buy into a

149
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,740
nasty market and actually easy to the
most common is module that we come back

150
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,840
looking like to come up so it goes to
multiply connecting all you can see the

151
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,620
interface we can fish

152
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:01,340
the real a real time from three ways
such as pcie and the USB also reports so

153
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,439
you know our situation and we'll just
this forward to and we will reduce the

154
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:14,390
serial port to get time from this and so
after after the ship it UPS and to be

155
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,480
delivered

156
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:24,090
and we now to briefly introduce the gps
tag so i don't know how many that you

157
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,740
guys a nosy detail of the gps type but
let me tell you it's but the principle

158
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:40,020
is really complicated complicated so
unfortunate easy but it but it doesn't

159
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,810
matter because i don't know whether your
guys listen to the presentation of this

160
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,090
trick to this trick yesterday and my
colleague and my colleague the top too

161
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,280
long and I just made a presentation
about the energy done great so but and

162
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,889
the hate and she's the opposite she's
the one who used to to give presentation

163
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,880
about how to make a GPS both signal last
year in depth on 23 and so it was really

164
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,910
interesting is the gps is pouring tea
house

165
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,840
I suggest you go to the YouTube and take
the video

166
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:24,419
mmm so here you see and that's back get
back to something serious and here's the

167
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,510
two pictures and the key information in
these pictures is a now we've got our

168
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:36,810
church pastor receiver on on the on the
ground and on the other unit skies there

169
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:43,200
is a lot of the UH that there is a lot
of machines that can see a center of the

170
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,580
signals to the gps receiver and what do
we do now

171
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:54,360
what we now to do is just to generator a
bunch of signals are in some in some

172
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:01,469
real formate and we can so so met Maxie
to get the receiver to think while there

173
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,860
are now we're up here is where i am and
what I'm I mean

174
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,689
and so uh that the important scenes that
is how we - is how we generator this

175
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,350
signal or you can see the oh you can see
the way

176
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:30,389
so is the second picture of Harry easy
of might of the best signal wave and

177
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:38,790
that there is a fivesome subframe and
their importance of that are easy some

178
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,340
frame - and some frame 30

179
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:48,419
there is a the information that can tear
cows a jet to be as a receiver where I

180
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:56,190
am and each you the front of the each
subframe and there is some information

181
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,890
is it can tell the gps receiver are now
what time it is

182
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:12,480
so uh the location doesn't matter but
the time is important and now we can

183
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:21,540
are there is the UH the the man appeared
on data we used to generate the GPS

184
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,230
signal

185
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:30,480
so firstly we need to get to the temple
and farmers raise the data and there are

186
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,380
two measures of 12 are downloaded from
NASA's you know a website and you can

187
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,330
record you too

188
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:51,720
but a and and and and I'd only yeah it's
the record it and so after you

189
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,870
after that you can use the open source
program or tssvar to receive the a

190
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:04,199
real-time GPS signal and the record
later and get a refresh data and oh so

191
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,570
after you get this

192
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,370
this data now you need to do is say to
the core into time and the current

193
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,639
location and the quarter our height of
that are that as is you know you want to

194
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,780
generate and uh oh maybe you guys it's
one way while they work well as these

195
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,100
things meaning but it doesn't matter
it's open source around a song

196
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,830
get out and if you guys are really
interested you can download the attack

197
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,149
the sea uh and and as a witch

198
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,429
well or which parameters is what with
was a rare meat of it

199
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:52,029
and so r is going to have a try after
these after we were we wrong least

200
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:56,830
providing mind that we were generated us
in all our that conclude to conclude

201
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:04,720
that the the time and the Edit ood that
we want and we put atsdr or you can see

202
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,899
a call you or you can say usrp and we
were generators the real sick real sick

203
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:19,658
gps signal so are absolutely wrong key
to enter the picture higher is if you

204
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,169
guys

205
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:27,309
download the the the PDF every time that
you can go meet and you can see the this

206
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:33,220
is the real time this is that are
exactly the time that we just a

207
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:44,950
generator on our on our-our-our isn't
cold and so here is the result the NT

208
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:53,500
server is Panik of it and as you can see
the easiest this is Sir sir line and

209
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,230
this is negative 4 hours into a ice
falls out in two seconds ahead

210
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,678
so why its connector

211
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:14,889
we were introduced better but a virgin
shooters later and but we will have

212
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:21,850
something more for something related to
introduce is how to up

213
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:28,000
update or you can upgrade to the attack
algorithm because if you got to really

214
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
wrong this

215
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,139
Metalab code that we just videos are you
will not we will find out that if you

216
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,658
want to generate a GPS signal

217
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:43,899
it causes so many times about 20 minutes
and the gala and we need a lot of our

218
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,139
story just a space such as

219
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:55,590
about four big bass and it's it's not a
real time that we want to attack 101 to

220
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,350
be as a weapon and observer and you now
to use the laptop and cause of 20

221
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,010
minutes

222
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,520
and because uh not exactly time that you
want

223
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:15,150
so are we need to upgrade update it so
are the cheapest generator of them are

224
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,060
so it's called we will find out where is
the CBS time that we used and the so

225
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:29,700
what we need to do is it a generator a
GPS signal and the final too where is

226
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:37,260
the gps time of by binary code is and
the replies late and the REE REE check

227
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,580
the party

228
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,030
so it's the principle is very easy and
what we what we need to do is just a

229
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,350
writer present and program and the
reason

230
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:56,820
read read the viral and rewrite eight
and you know we put it in the u.s. RP

231
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,659
and we played it and just that all fun

232
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:09,120
so after we introduce the ntp server and
over

233
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:18,090
not the the detail of the the detail
tech of the data why bird and the 80s a

234
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:25,919
receiver and let's get to let's try to
attack a real one and observer

235
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:34,770
so oh let's test the matter some
prototype and try to use it

236
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,660
so we need what are we now to do is to
set up an interview server and here is a

237
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,660
detail over here is the key . uh

238
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:50,830
of the gps of the mg ntp servers can
configure a complete prior

239
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:57,490
yeah and here is the gy uh-oh here we
set up it as a junior wipe a did wiper

240
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:10,420
and as it's a proper reference and here
is the screenshot and now we just set

241
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,500
the NTP servers IP address to the HP
servers that we just set up

242
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,210
so are what we use the washer to capture
the network traffic as you can see in

243
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:31,870
the reference variety is JY so that
means our of that observer is now

244
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,550
working

245
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:41,320
so let's can attack it so as we just
introduced us and now we need to do is

246
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:50,020
control our TTYL bird and ascend to the
data and try to meditate to send out the

247
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:58,060
signals and the two in influence the ntp
server so a better

248
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:04,000
what are but the thing is that matters
is can we inject any time

249
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,430
remember we just a generator GPS signal
and we will keep him a time that ahead

250
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,590
about a force out in two seconds

251
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:21,159
but the thing is the ntp server is just
crushed so of Harry's I think the ntp

252
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:29,710
server if you read is the source code
and we are noticed that if the time that

253
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,730
the and observer

254
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,029
just get it

255
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:38,629
from is from is a reference clock and
the the distance is really really big

256
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:45,289
so the ntp server we were just we were
crushed and i will panic and the uh it's

257
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,879
it's the limit

258
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:58,609
so what we need to do is just the
largest dinner came limits that we read

259
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:04,908
a reader source code and we accept our
exercise and we find out it's four hours

260
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:13,609
and if that means if you inject a time
that is ahead or behind the times that

261
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:18,799
of the ntp server Ruiz and the it is
larger than zero four hours and they

262
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,668
were panicking

263
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:27,979
so what we need to do is just her to a
dozen tests too short

264
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:34,940
the distance so it's not what we want
and are it's not whatever we want

265
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:46,820
so but one after we tried to try to
inject a one-hour that behind all you

266
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,739
can say is three hours and a real time

267
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:52,700
what happened at the end of the servers
called close

268
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,479
it's just a loose it lost please come
got connections so why it is that means

269
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:05,029
actually there is a lot of more limits
in there are we trying to find out i

270
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:09,859
know we find out the time upset is more
than one sound times

271
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:17,059
so the server we sat down it's not just
24 hours and the it's a and the four

272
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:19,129
hours is the first step

273
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:24,799
I first limiter then the next limit is 1
something times I was outlets Evans

274
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:41,020
that's the NDB implant intention it's
really really close and so now what we

275
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:48,820
can do is what we can do is just to
Maxine's a mix it's slower because if

276
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,700
you want to inject any time what do we
need to do is try to the that is the

277
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:00,790
first time we inject a time that is the
offset is a lot more than the one sound

278
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,820
a second and the statue is where you'll
see nine hundred seconds and after this

279
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:12,280
after this are after this step affected
and we will generally we were in just

280
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,190
another 900 seconds

281
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,090
so there's more and more and more mon
amour and this is quite a slope

282
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,300
and there is a little bit more short
Commons

283
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:40,050
that is the root of desperation and if
you if you try to do this if each one

284
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,340
try this again

285
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:49,169
I the this exercise there is a lot of
all limits things there because our one

286
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,200
we just have to capture the track the
network traffic

287
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:59,250
there's a reduced to a lot of different
route depression in 8r that is actually

288
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,280
not limited to to the server is a limit
to the kind the kind of we'll just order

289
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,389
to a calculator that the difference
between it of the local time to the

290
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,650
never more time

291
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,400
so when the weights why it's not you
know the this distance is large and as a

292
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,960
client we were just a close

293
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,929
it's a connection so here is another
limited so if you want to of what we

294
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:35,100
solve this problem is just something
negative more slower and a in our attack

295
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:42,178
script and we consider about of the or
Colonel patter the the ntp server panic

296
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:53,400
and the kind of closes connection and
it's a so after this hour are accessible

297
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,360
matter of fact

298
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,320
so if you guys want more details that of
of the the art work or request for

299
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,090
commander and are 59 old 05 are

300
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,760
let's decimate the medicine which hand
if you want to know about a lot more

301
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,760
details you can decorate it

302
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:25,379
so here's the hour or tech demo is that
we just to recall want

303
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,730
ok

304
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,050
so as you can see our this phone that is
you

305
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:52,959
we use a with snaps is and observer
address to the server that we just set

306
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,420
up and this clock

307
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,890
it means a real time and is not quite
clear

308
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:08,110
but if you if you see the smoke rose
closer and you can see the the the

309
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,630
numbers which is a typed only on the
other behind that means we just are we

310
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:20,050
are what we do is now we are trying to
control heated wiper and met each to

311
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:30,460
influence our uh our energy server that
is so you can see in and and is this

312
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:38,980
time there were yours is about a four
o'clock that way in the is after hunter

313
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,860
response

314
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:57,489
so . the influence that the real time is
about a two o'clock and the influence

315
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:59,920
their times about three o'clock

316
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,019
haha and are we now we try to control

317
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,519
try to matter it is about four o'clock
or so here is the this is a difference

318
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:15,609
and this is a difficult since that if we
want to Maxine's met met or would want

319
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:22,509
to change the ntp server and it will
cost the so many times and are we just

320
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:29,380
met this distance about our one hour and
we just use about 30 minutes to make it

321
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,380
come true

322
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:51,629
so uh what what what I just introduced
is just a prototype that I just said I

323
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:57,300
set up but in real time and maybe you
guys want to ask a why not why not just

324
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,270
a bio and the real and observer and just
attack a torso and the record a demo

325
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:08,730
so here is the thing is this until the
server is just so expensive

326
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,319
about 10,000 two dollars and eat too
much

327
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,960
so you guys know about some guys in this
and if the server

328
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:26,819
uh and and reserved comedy and you can
tell them we we can we are glad to offer

329
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:31,529
the attractive girls and tell them how
to test her retested there and you

330
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,010
deserve

331
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,190
so uh oh

332
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,109
there is a lot of TV service , de that's
a matter of days and the as you can see

333
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:49,770
we can we cause they at as you can see
we've got the enteric yammering but

334
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:56,940
bring Bob my burger place a large
companies had met and observer and such

335
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:10,349
as more product and the Heritage listing
sister were and s200 and are all this

336
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:19,109
choose our come from the foreign company
and our this released its more solemn I

337
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:25,020
is another and Harry's the observer in
China that we made

338
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,630
but and when we met converts it kind of
conversations with them and we were uh

339
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:36,329
we know that a lot of things about where
they use this

340
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:43,950
where are where they use the end of the
summer and a how many people will vary

341
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,868
by this and you surrender

342
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:51,660
where they want put in for it and where
they use it and after we a

343
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,820
after we met at this conversation and
the window all better

344
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,990
actually in China as there is in prizren
and playstation and the bank and

345
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:13,029
electronic system they use such as this
models and according to our tech of I

346
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:22,990
was bluffing attack and a their engineer
told us that are seriously their their

347
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,290
products cannot prevent from this time
smoking so maybe

348
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:35,110
oh we come close to Z to this place such
as a present such as bank and we met at

349
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,190
this attack

350
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:44,320
so this system just this system we were
just crushed and other week google it

351
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:52,270
and Harriet's the another are realtek
maybe an example are very test her

352
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:59,020
no it's about one guy and last year they
talk they just posted a heart article

353
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,340
about their bank and observer and told
us

354
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:10,810
are there any server they don't know why
that is Christ and of this banks only

355
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:17,470
use this one and observer as the root
and the server so updated Christ their

356
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:30,129
engineer has to update the time manually
and it's almost a disaster so

357
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,569
here is our reference and our most
thankful

colleague and at home and met a gps

359
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,359
spoofing and it's an instrument made us
and asked Walker more easier than the

360
