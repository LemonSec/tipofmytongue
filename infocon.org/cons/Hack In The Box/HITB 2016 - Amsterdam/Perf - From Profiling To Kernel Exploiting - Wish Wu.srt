1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,000
hello everyone i'm wishing from trying
to Michael global threat response team

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,150
and here we are talking about a perfect
for from providing tucano exploiting

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:35,510
performance counters for linux are a new
kernel based a subsystem that provider

4
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:43,309
frame walk for performance analysis they
cover both hardware features and the

5
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:55,640
software features if you run commander
man menu / for her perfect event open

6
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,549
their will show more than one starter
last descriptions one power and Lance on

7
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:11,479
my wider screen it is there it is very
real to describe only one system call

8
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,430
so it is a very complex the memorial in
the colonel

9
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:25,250
since the system called perfect Amanda
open is enabled on the most of the

10
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,100
latest some a difference there is no
strong relationship between the android

11
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,220
version and the customize the android
linux version vendors can also customize

12
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,850
the the linux kernel and the selinux
policy most and enjoy the versions from

13
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:52,460
four point four point four to six . o .
the one have been able to this coal and

14
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,408
the application which has no enjoy the
permission required can you focus this

15
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:05,210
cop you for your divide her developer
android application you should do a

16
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,490
clear you have lost

17
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:14,959
what's a the permission you should have
a video when without a director at the

18
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,090
clear and yet any permission

19
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:25,040
can you focus this system call there
will give of force of course for sense

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
to user

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,060
to trust the people we are not at all
and you and your actions and your

22
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,189
section many simply renders the where I
would like to add added their own

23
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,390
p mu a mu is the performance monitor
unit a monitor you unit and there were

24
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,390
your employment employment is there
aren't method to monitor their such as

25
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:04,319
CPU the performance office if you and
other hardware for specific performance

26
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
testing this code will be merged

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,129
we're not be merging into the man line
of clinical so they code may not be

28
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:25,019
totally reviewed here you the code the
relationship of perfect performance the

29
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,859
subsystem has many architectural and a
vendor related to codes for activation

30
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:41,609
of specific code so such as the arm and
x86 and Power PC and such as

31
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:54,389
architecture to relate and the vendor
specific code is such as com or or sent

32
00:03:54,389 --> 00:04:00,449
on all or such as vendors they had that
we are right there

33
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:07,440
there we are added their own codes into
the kernel not in the manner of or in

34
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
texts

35
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:25,099
here are four ways for me to detector
the boxing the perfect first though we

36
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,080
can use the / so we should have thanks
to the these two guys they're released

37
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,210
the paper and her father tore it that
happen

38
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:48,349
helps me a lot they put their projects
on the github and here is the heat their

39
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,310
papers

40
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:57,979
there's the second tour use the
opportunity treaties where no system

41
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,139
core father

42
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:13,639
it is sometimes hear from you it then
you should a code review the perfect

43
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,880
more perfect OPP system they have many
coats you shouldn't know how it works

44
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,639
and their relationships

45
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,889
shivers then after reading the code and
I I write I write some tour by myself

46
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,280
test their heard this called specific
codes you in the car not

47
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:56,539
I have found five boxes are perfect
subsystem of enjoyed the CBE 2016

48
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:07,460
Oh enter all five and the CBE 2016 08
fourth three are out of bummed boundary

49
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,590
access box in the colonel

50
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:16,640
it is in the core com simple related to
coat the performance performance and

51
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:25,849
then really coach performance of the
test codes in

52
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:34,310
yeah I also 40 submit to some issue to
google there

53
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,460
google has the defined the separate you
two critical and a another one is low

54
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:55,880
there is on published there are a lot of
population and now then i will exploit

55
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:04,640
to the critical Bob savory 2016 08 a 19
before the body is fixed that these

56
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,640
funds that may be impossible ineffective
because i don't want ur I haven't a

57
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:19,909
tester and all all of the friends I have
a test on the Nexus 6 the guys is some

58
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,910
sunglasses note for note for note of age

59
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,840
this park is the walked

60
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,770
this Park existing or Android
smartphones which has Qualcomm cpu and

61
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,400
linux version 3 . 10 serious

62
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
here is the pocket register of source
code

63
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:06,350
the red lines that are added by qualcomm
or you go go

64
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,760
variable constraint to duplicate is the
editor in to function perfect release

65
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:22,340
the phrase the connected to that close
the system call if we invoke a close on

66
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,349
a fire description

67
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,740
there we are you vocal the perfect
released once the way you look closer

68
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:39,620
and set up a constricted duplicate to
one then the event estate we are

69
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:53,720
changing from of two active again in
factors the google chrome's developer

70
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,950
sink as this variable use the use the
internal auditor you but we consider two

71
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:09,980
in the u.s. space that to use the the
man may reason to cost the cost of back

72
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:27,029
if we said to the constraint implicated
in the u.s. space & and this less data

73
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:33,449
we are you call active if we don't think
we will return but I we're set it so i

74
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:39,990
can city to active wing we close the
have the fire discourse ft

75
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:56,819
now will you look at the pmu glitter
function that means if we all we can't

76
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:04,529
we can't disable that change to the fact
that change to change their activity two

77
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:14,880
awful twice then delete to the event
twice here you the test the codes just

78
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,250
with the clear profit when I catch a
tribute

79
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:30,990
then type of tool chest . . you . it is
a man . it

80
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,990
this variable use the not in the
standard ahead of fire is a antegrade

81
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,870
provide help provided by google

82
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,680
so we should i use a shifter to set of
this bit

83
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,849
21 now

84
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:55,529
perfect window open letter F D I'll
controller ft 2 is a boy

85
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,519
now we are deleted from the list first
app that I close it

86
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,710
and we're delighted to the perfect event
from least the second time and afraid

87
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:19,420
the bottom of the bugger can double it
to actually see the note father for

88
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,459
listening Colonel eaten

89
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:31,300
not her does not you call free it G is
not a c++ they the deli top

90
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,510
it's the operation is a function to
delete a node or delete a list of a tail

91
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:44,740
know the formulas that not a fruit or
delete the Notre can be added in to

92
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,060
actually start again

93
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,060
no notes can only be added into actually
it's the head butter can be deleted from

94
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,020
anywhere

95
00:11:53,020 --> 00:12:04,990
this use the edge lister every node had
next the pointer which points to the

96
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,190
next node

97
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:14,560
they also have a pee pre pointer which
points to the pre previous note that

98
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:22,959
actually starts from mr. head least the
head her header has a first appointment

99
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,810
to love points to the first note then
the last Notre the next pointer points

100
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,959
to now I forgot behind either here

101
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,920
yeah

102
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,720
here is the note that delete function of
H least getting one note the people . .

103
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,830
of the note that we are beset to list
the point into the point that too after

104
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,110
their deleted the note that we are set
to the people . people pointed to list .

105
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:15,320
into this is the point until you called
20 2016 16 to beat android it is a

106
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,970
little bit different from others sick
assertive so 64 bit of Android

107
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:34,160
so then i use a memory map since the
mall and a memory lock system call to

108
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,420
put a memory

109
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,530
Oh to the address

110
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,530
- OH -

111
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:57,620
I use the i use the map populate ER
parameter to our to make sure the city ,

112
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,830
memory is mapped to the virtual address
2020 co if we are just the user member

113
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,990
her memory mapping there

114
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,630
the the current just a map markers that
you have the address

115
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:21,320
not means the physical memory is the
earlier allocated to your process they

116
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:29,810
use the page for the technology to put
them out of memory or to you when you

117
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:40,939
use use it in the matches the secret
ability google said the list appointment

118
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,380
- 200

119
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:51,800
its value is smaller than the member
memory map and minimal address that

120
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,490
means you can't use the system called to
put a memory to the to the to all this

121
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,650
address isn't not allowed

122
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:10,520
now we win the value value is smaller
than memory map mean more address it

123
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,520
mitigates the problem

124
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,820
here I we are dem on the double delete
operation you to mail a little bit of

125
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,949
confused with you first

126
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:38,189
I do I owe control just I don't control
we are delighted to know that 20 months

127
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,370
the program will go alone

128
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,470
note the twenties p prove pointer to
find know the twenties previous noda now

129
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,459
the proof we also know that use the no
10 then modify no tents next to a point

130
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:12,839
to point 2 30 then program or go go
along the next day . good . to find that

131
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:20,519
it's the low 20s next note next to no
time now is noted 32 motive i notice 30

132
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:28,709
is the people pointed to the 10 then you
need to the know the 20 people to 20 all

133
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:44,000
most definitely is finished then I
clothes no 20

134
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,010
the program program where go alone

135
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:59,710
the note 20 is the people . to find the
memory too old or natural to the memory

136
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:14,290
into all to as an odor then writer know
the thirties address - 20 - it a leak

137
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,079
leak the know the time had no service
addressed to you the space that is a

138
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:35,409
info leak then add the program go after
close the node 20-20 is afraid now

139
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,260
now I just to close the notice earlier
it directly

140
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,910
no surgery is gone

141
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:09,040
no x next to point to point to a freezer
space that use after free is treated you

142
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,379
t is simple I think no because i have
many other work to do

143
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:25,630
we must create a grace appear in the to
write release to the deli terasi you an

144
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,130
easier way to do this

145
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:34,120
he is calling sleep sleep and then the
grace of pure in that is a term or four

146
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,979
I see you I see you means the reading
copy up data it is the technology in the

147
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,390
colonel it so we are delayed the delete
operation

148
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,230
oh we should make sure that know that
you really do it

149
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:57,550
we muster well we can't all be either
way to go to do this is a core Core

150
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,030
sleep but if we you more sleep

151
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,830
the Notre we are shit out of the cpu
should I was cpu after she'd our

152
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,610
superiors and know that will be deleted
or another will be deleted from the list

153
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:18,010
then the pros says the shooting the cpu
that the note we are we added added to

154
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,210
list again

155
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,900
there were caused some problem such as
the unique

156
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,900
if we need to loop

157
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:35,120
yeah

158
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:43,250
he is the side effect or for your local
sleep and so how how we are revealed

159
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,350
freda free the note which will should
have put a dead head to the address

160
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:59,120
we know that the Grand Master pointers .
to the freedom dress then I oil while i

161
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,070
will try to who created this memory loud
layout and in the colonel

162
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:14,090
I over many FPS many ft 2016

163
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,990
this is the lower dress to hire
addressing the colonel left to use the

164
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,160
lower dress

165
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,950
writing is the higher address the memory
of that allowed to look that like that

166
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,429
the head the list the head is here that
next next next last want you to learn

167
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:40,250
now then every 44 object to you want
pictures

168
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:56,740
but the the real situation is complex
that we when the rare situation is more

169
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,870
complicated

170
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:07,870
whoa i were trying to try to create this
primary memory out what we have another

171
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:18,850
problem with one process the only have a
one hour and 24 FPS so I so I use a fork

172
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:24,730
for out too many powder process every
approach how the process

173
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:38,590
who we are open many many ft is to feel
the memory raise the the address - Reza

174
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:49,899
dress up then create a clean space that
we can control these the members me now

175
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,970
we should a sense to her

176
00:21:51,970 --> 00:22:01,000
I will should sense to the this three
guys they're released the papers and

177
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,210
technology to let give me a chance to
surprise rather by customed customize

178
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:21,370
the data to kind of space and a steer
know where the data is simply is said to

179
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,139
virtual address

180
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,410
what possibility possible here

181
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,450
map the map dit hitter to the same
physical memory

182
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
he is a possible

183
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,830
well Colonel calls a call the memory
here for you

184
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:51,629
kernel space memory here for the low low
memory that you use the high memory

185
00:22:51,630 --> 00:23:04,799
according to the kernel memory use the
rule i exploit to the user after free by

186
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:17,010
the lack of this but a bicontinuous day
exposing the next denoted address and

187
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,379
your I find a noted that a Methodist the
starter offer page

188
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,659
I topically to this I know it

189
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:35,070
this address is the address is not
taking a start of the page then i go to

190
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:45,720
sleep and there really be created at
least I'm just very quiet and i ee to

191
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,130
this to find it its address into not in
the page of start then go to sleep with

192
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:01,140
that there are double opportunity to it
then I found a dress at a start of a

193
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:09,720
page then then I feel it too

194
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:17,789
I closer get closer to close it then
close the one more page is this

195
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:24,149
operating is a use the tool raise the
success rate

196
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:28,830
surprise success rate

197
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:42,289
then i use the return to direct to
technology to surprise data to this

198
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,549
address

199
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:49,908
then the last of the less the FDU the
next to point you to the point tool here

200
00:24:49,909 --> 00:25:04,580
now put a date a key to hear the last
step i will use our I work commander the

201
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:13,668
colonel to traverse the list and use a
function pointer that I controlled this

202
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:20,210
object ER has a function pointer cannot
use the function pointer

203
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:24,440
I oh ho after going to use a function
pointer

204
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:33,049
I can control its pc pc or a gesture the
I'm certain it's 32

205
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:40,850
well don't have a happy ending enable
the the written to use it you use the

206
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:47,418
technology we tend to use of technology
it is that is the colonel colonel

207
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:59,990
context can be changing to change it to
the user space directly so we can jump a

208
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,710
tool

209
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,649
- I prepare this piece of code in my
user space that that i led to the

210
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:11,059
colonel jump to my my user space code
that you killed my coder

211
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:24,120
and the get Rueter pitch the root
operation is a very sick minute to the

212
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,290
defense

213
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:33,540
hey it is that his nickname it possible
that our water source code but they have

214
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,389
some difference but as for by the first
paper use the same is set the address

215
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,440
limiter to the maximum of value

216
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,860
officer in teacher address a limited in
just that at least its name

217
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:57,120
it's a limiter one thread and the kernel
which will address the cat the maximum

218
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,399
number of addresses the taxes to the if
we modify modified to the maximum

219
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,620
maximum number of integer we can access
to all the kernel space

220
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,120
Colonel come over Colonel virtual
address it started from see there are 0

221
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,899
0 that and start over the CEO dress

222
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,649
we can access the horror of the virtual
address of the colonel that we can to

223
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:36,508
handle anything the colonel will read a
writer and other scenes

224
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,490
now we should have said to the it is a
viable in the colonel is a global

225
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:51,629
variable on Android enjoy the linux
kernel doesn't have a colonel address

226
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,158
debates layout randomization for now

227
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,250
so it is the fixed surgery fixed address

228
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:07,230
what can we can extractor inter from the
image

229
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:15,929
put it out put . IMG image so we know it
is and we said 20 to bypass the selinux

230
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:20,279
if we said to the variable to Rivero the
the horse

231
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,139
selinux is it's down Oh use the disabled
it

232
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:29,639
the priests use that we're stopping you
now

233
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:36,990
then i modified the structure crane
intentional

234
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:43,649
that is a look at the secret object and
its into their own or negative or from

235
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:50,969
negative 1 and some more some value here
after you

236
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:59,519
crow modify your credentials there you
can be root your process changes from

237
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,519
will change it to route now

238
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:17,220
now I bring the next the next six here i
will routine now use this exploit

239
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:51,059
yeah

240
00:29:51,059 --> 00:30:00,899
we aren't we are sure using now we are
sure you the name of the cher show the

241
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,809
selinux connects years

242
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:08,158
share use a raw raw raw you the show

243
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,190
yes

244
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,940
maybe I assure the virtual office and
joined

245
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:57,940
is the sixth . o . want sharp some music

246
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,559
it's a nickname and peter has the
februari secreted to punch label because

247
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,119
it is fixedly the match that I submit to
the usual to google

248
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:29,169
it is not one hundred percent success
rate

249
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:37,179
so you may feel sometimes a deal for
them

250
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,679
here it is for our child counterparts
and do some work

251
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,249
find a target it is on the legislature
this or isn't this address these on the

252
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:52,179
package that and I Oh tries to pry data
then

253
00:31:52,179 --> 00:32:01,269
so until it shows that the clothes to
address them and try to get this prior

254
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:04,269
field field and try again try again

255
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:27,700
yeah

256
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,320
sorry

257
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,210
yeah

258
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,620
the sims field where we started

259
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,419
place the weight of a minute

260
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:20,319
yeah

261
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,750
yeah

262
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,050
yeah

263
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:21,070
ok ok ok ok thank you

264
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,600
then you can ID

265
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:38,470
my ID is routine now and the my connects
the changes to the colonel shop here can

266
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:51,399
creative of you can try to create a fire
is the system are the director much fire

267
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,730
yeah

268
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,600
thank you

269
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,220
well how to read

270
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,840
huh

271
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,840
ok

272
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:39,420
oh yeah

273
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,420
right

274
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,879
now we really have the rotor wanting you
the permission

275
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,299
I think I'm finished

276
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:16,629
and what I have questions and come we
can I have a microwave anyone has

277
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,630
question

278
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,900
you demonstrate on the Nexus and my
question is this vulnerability is ben

279
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:35,770
can be used on other devices like
Samsung or other vendors or just stoned

280
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,770
in axis or you didn't check it

281
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,390
I mean the colonel vulnerability that
you exploit it right now is slow

282
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,830
the exploiters should the walk home on
the front that we mentioned generally

283
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,540
out generic is your R is your exploit it
is my question

284
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:05,200
haha

285
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,180
you test it and all those devices and no
no I haven't I'm possibly possibly any

286
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,319
hippies

287
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,220
i believe that i have a test the myth
fun

288
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:37,829
this one and he ok thank you but I
shouldn't have mentioned in the the

289
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:38,609
bargain

290
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:46,950
isn't the exploited not walking all the
I'm 664 because the communicates the

291
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,129
deployment how google google

292
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,549
oh ok

293
00:38:53,549 --> 00:39:03,869
the list . + 2 is the de ad there are
there there's a they're all then to all

294
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:12,960
da dee did there that this address is
the up that the data that's the address

295
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,720
data start for starter with dead

296
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,279
you cannot be you he put a marrow
married to get herself

297
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:29,130
he's a design awful it is a kind of
