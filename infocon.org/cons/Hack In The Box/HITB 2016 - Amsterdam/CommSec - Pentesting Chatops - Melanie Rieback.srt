1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:23,080
okay you guys can all hear me alright
great so i am going to talk to you guys

2
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,459
today about something called pentesting
chat ops

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,070
who here in the room actually knows what
chat Ops is raise your hands

4
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,080
ok so that's about the half of the half
that raise their hand is it because you

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,710
saw my talk before

6
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:48,090
I thought so alright so so chat Ops is
basically a really good idea that i

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,329
stole from github within the company and
it's basically about a sort of a CTF

8
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,220
like workflow that we use for our pen
testing company that works really

9
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,540
incredibly for us and I think also for
those of you who also do pen testing

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,190
here in this room I think it might also
work really great for you guys so but

11
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,190
first eight tiny bit about our company

12
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,820
so we're a bit of a funny

13
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,639
yeah Oh kind of weird thing I what we
are is first of all and nonprofits a

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,700
computer security consultancy company

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,570
sounds a bit strange but basically we're
just a commercial front end for a

16
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,258
non-profit back and the bat nonprofit
back and we support as the end on that

17
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,159
foundation but that's actually not
important for our story

18
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,539
what's important for our story is that
we have a bunch of a pen testers that

19
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,479
are actually distributed around the
world

20
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,539
ok we were purely with freelancers and
the head of my pen test team for example

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,540
is this dutch guy who lives in Brisbane
Australia

22
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,399
that's far away I've got some testers
that are located in a 12-person majority

23
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,530
of them are in the Netherlands and in
Europe

24
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,209
I've also got staff members in the
United States and you know so basically

25
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,660
we've got pretty much every time zone
covered if it you know

26
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,239
first which is both a blessing and a
curse right I mean it's a curse because

27
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,040
you know

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,459
it's really hard to have all hands
meetings not that I like meetings anyway

29
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,819
but you know but nonetheless you know
about and it's a blessing because of

30
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,298
course we can kind of go around the
clock go working on stuff without

31
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,950
overworking folks

32
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,720
so anyway what what

33
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:41,120
oops so the way that we actually work in
terms of a shout out is that you can see

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,840
right here

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,659
basically there is a in a chat room uh
you can see right here a list of a

36
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,030
number of the people that are you know
our staff members sometimes also

37
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,810
customers and basically we're using this
tool called rocket chat

38
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,689
ok raise your hand if you've ever used
slack okay let's have the people here

39
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:10,280
so basically rocket jet is an open
source self hosted version of slack

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,680
we absolutely love you no slack and its
functionality but of course we are not

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,310
planning on giving them our customers
pen test data if you know henceforth we

42
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,760
find a nice open source version so we
can host it ourselves but uh of course

43
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,290
uh well it means you basically have to
set it up for yourself and the but it's

44
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,709
actually been great because it's open
source we've actually been extending it

45
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:40,639
now chat Ops is basically a concept that
was originated by get hub and github

46
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,959
also is a globally distributed company
so I think that I mean they have some

47
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,590
kind of office and in Silicon Valley but
the entire rest of their personnel is

48
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,819
located everywhere

49
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,638
so the way that they work is they have
actually taken their entire DevOps and

50
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,959
they've actually are protected things as
such so that they can do their entire

51
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,930
DevOps operations from their chat room

52
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,379
okay with the idea that they can
literally you know deploys deploy UVM's

53
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,750
patch things basically do all kinds of
different upgrades configuration changes

54
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,769
all the usual DevOps you know chef huh
but Papa danceable you know who usual

55
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,650
them up stuff but the thing is they use
this chat but that's called Hugh bot

56
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,219
HUP OT

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,640
essentially it's just a chat bot to that
you can also use an IRC

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,330
you can also use it you know and
campfire slack you know a whole bunch of

59
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,590
other different channels and the way
that they actually had it set up was

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,479
that you can basically a you know do all
those uh you know operations and able to

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,330
do new deployments to their website i
mean literally they have all kinds of

62
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,570
continued to continuous integration
stuff you know that that's running out

63
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,500
of the chat they have network monitoring
stuff that's going into the chat if you

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,340
know so that a distributed team can
actually have full visibility on what

65
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,900
each other is doing well you know what
when I heard about them doing this

66
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,489
I was like well first of all I said this
actually sounds a lot like how a

67
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,200
distributed CTF teamworks thick because
of course actually a lot of what we do

68
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,080
at our os's is inspired by capture the
flag it and you know the end for the

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,710
rest

70
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,219
you know I figured you know this would
actually really work great for pen

71
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,300
testing if you know you're basically
having a distributed team and trying to

72
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,790
make things visible and other thing also
that is sort of an added bonus is with

73
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,540
radically open security we also have
this this thing that you know we're

74
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,940
really big on openness and transparency

75
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,080
what that means in practice is that we
actually invite our customers to join us

76
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,030
in the chat room now the really nice
thing about Chad Ops is it means that

77
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,590
any time we're working as long as we're
actually launching our pen testing and

78
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,739
launching our reporting and launching
all of our other thing parts of our

79
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,790
operations

80
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,610
it means that if a customer there is
there on the chat room they can actually

81
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,820
observe everything we're doing 50 which
actually has led to a really good

82
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,710
formula that customers are extremely
happy with who you know and that

83
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,739
actually really having this kind of a
chat

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,780
integrated environment really enables
which is actually much much harder to do

85
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,940
if you're just sort of working in the
office

86
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,850
50 you know are using other kinds of
other times of tools so i can give you

87
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,080
guys some examples basically of how this
works and first you can see right now

88
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,128
that

89
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,449
with you box so we basically renamed
this raw spot

90
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,939
of course if you know and we have
basically installed a whole bunch of

91
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,789
different tools all kinds of different
things that you can use from the chat so

92
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:47,009
it ranges from totally useful

93
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:53,219
I mean things like you know being able
to do various kinds of you know look up

94
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:57,629
some different kinds who is mrs. and you
know these kinds of things to you know

95
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,779
you know to to being able to launch
scans

96
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,529
you know four different kinds of pen
testing - you know the completely stupid

97
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:13,139
and inane like I mean you can't have a
chat without like cat photos or XKCD you

98
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:13,469
know

99
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,889
so we've actually got you bot scripts
for all of this

100
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:23,969
so we've also got a also sort of this
raw spot shell commands that we're using

101
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,459
four inputs and physician because of
course yes

102
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:31,800
like the day I installed this the first
thing my guys tried to attack it and

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,249
then the second thing they did was wrong
spot image me go to you at which point I

104
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:45,719
was like stockport the Channel please
put but anyway so

105
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:50,519
ok but but what that means is we can
actually though the way that it works is

106
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,959
you use a coffee script to basically
right to the integrations between

107
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,039
whatever script you would want on the
back end and then the chat bot

108
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,550
you know the actual interface and in the
chat and then essentially you can write

109
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,429
with this your script on the back end in
whatever language you're comfortable

110
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:05,849
with

111
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,378
if so so you know a really simple
example of something that we've

112
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,569
implemented is nmap you know good and
it's basically nothing more than just

113
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,579
being able to feed a certain number of
parameters to and map that are supplied

114
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,809
on the command line of course obviously
we do need to do input sanitization and

115
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:28,139
do other forms of access control because
if especially if customers are in the

116
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,829
channels with us we need to be a little
bit careful about you know who can

117
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,490
actually operate which you know commands
within our chat environment

118
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,080
so what

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,510
yes we thought about that as well so it
but but there's number of really weird

120
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:51,080
and wonderful things that we can do from
the chat now here's a pen tester knows

121
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,170
that the most annoying part of pen
testing is reporting that documentation

122
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,920
you know I mean I you know it's really
time consuming you know I mean we just

123
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,599
want to have the things you know and
then afterwards are like we really have

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,650
to write it up

125
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:12,650
yes you do but so what if you know but
of course us like any other a pen

126
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,819
testing company

127
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,640
we of course build our like a sweet to
automate this because you know i mean i

128
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,980
know that they're still companies out
there that are you know cutting and

129
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,830
pasting things into Word documents but
does it

130
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,280
I could but I tell you

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,459
yeah but i can tell you from like you
know the first couple months of our my

132
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,540
company's existence before we had
automation that doesn't ok cutting and

133
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,719
pasting stuff to open office is not what
you want to do so

134
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,290
so what we did is we wrote this XML
Swede

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,150
so what it is is there's xml templates
and the pen testers can basically just

136
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,079
fill in the templates and they actually
really like this because you know it

137
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,350
provides actually a structure for the
pen testing and sort of reminds them of

138
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,500
what kind of information they have to
write down as they're actually doing the

139
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,690
testing and then the also another nice
thing about with xml as if we have for

140
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,220
example common a sort of what we call
snippets so for example commonly

141
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,410
occurring

142
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,939
things like cross-site scripting you
always need the same description of like

143
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,660
okay this is what cross site scripting
is and this is how you remediated and

144
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,540
you know obviously we don't want to
reinvent reinvent the wheel so we have a

145
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,040
little snippet library which is actually
pretty soon we should be open sourcing

146
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,939
that they were so kind of collecting all
the snippets it together right now but

147
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:31,420
the basically just so we can also kind
of you know toss that you know into our

148
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,599
XML in the right place and so that if
you just need to compile that it just

149
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,180
sort of comes out correctly so another
thing about radically open security by

150
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,089
the way is that we're really into open
source

151
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,350
we love open source and what that means
is every tool and framework that we

152
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,980
build once it's ready for the light of
day we open source it

153
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,639
you know I mean so we basically just
trying to optimize for the amount of

154
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,850
self and you liked give away just
because we can so so r XM l a-- a pen

155
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,589
testing suite is actually in good in
github so if you guys happen to have a

156
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,290
pen testing company and you guys are
still working with Microsoft Word or

157
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,910
what not to feel free to steal our
system and use it

158
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,019
it's actually extremely useful if you
guys also want to do automated scanning

159
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:21,069
within a big huge mega corporation you
guys also need some kind of you know

160
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:25,479
system you can just basically steal our
stuff put in your own corporate logo and

161
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,279
it's actually really pretty easy to use

162
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,740
so this is not yet official by the way
but we're actually having discussions

163
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,360
right now with a loss about potentially
trying to also make it in a loss project

164
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,949
good so I think if it is hopefully will
be happening i think in the next

165
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,750
you know hopefully couple weeks so that
would actually be cool and further help

166
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,470
to spread and canonize you know the you
know the fact that this is sort of a

167
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,220
free tool automation you know for
everybody who does what and testing and

168
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,059
other things

169
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:58,540
so uh there's all kinds of documentation
now that we've written it's actually

170
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,779
quite quite decent and you can sort of
see right now

171
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,180
it explains how the reports are
structured you can actually see right

172
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,569
now an example of how we would be
writing up the findings we've got things

173
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:12,790
like section section ID

174
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,790
you know different cross references you
can see up here sort of like title you

175
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,160
know paragraphs images

176
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,250
you know well anyway set stuff

177
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,100
xml basically descriptions of of what
we're doing and then when we compile it

178
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:33,339
it turns into something that looks like
this yeah if it so that looks pretty

179
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:33,880
good

180
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:41,199
if it so um so what we do is we can
actually we've set things up so you can

181
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,500
actually compile this from our chat
environment

182
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,350
so the way that it works is and now
we're going back to the rocket jet is

183
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,139
you can see now we've got this a raw
spot shell command PDF build a customer

184
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:57,399
named blurred out of course

185
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,730
hey you know a pen test and then at that
point to what

186
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,839
what's happening is it says wrong spot
so first it's actually doing a git clone

187
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,970
i should also mention by the way that we
use a get lab as our primary means of

188
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,529
version control and sort of
collaborative editing it within our OS

189
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,089
on

190
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:19,990
we use get lab for our private stuff we
use github for our public stuff

191
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,889
obviously we try of course to to move
stuff over from get lab to get out of

192
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,809
this as much as possible so but but what
you can actually see is happening is

193
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,469
that when you type in that command the
first thing that it's doing it so doing

194
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,199
a clone from git clone from the gate lab
refill

195
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,410
now what it's doing is it's actually
calling the toolchain so we're basically

196
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:44,019
using a sort of xml xslt fault you know
that that whole system to basically

197
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,809
generate our PDF so you can see that
it's a compiling the PDF and then what

198
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:55,389
is actually happening is it's actually
committing the PDF that was created back

199
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:56,860
into the repo

200
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,189
ok and then what it's doing is its
spitting out a link to the PDF so

201
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:08,019
basically what it means is that
technical writers and pen testers don't

202
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,640
even necessarily have to install the
tool chain on

203
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,939
local machines all i want to do but
nonetheless

204
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,170
what it means is that they can be just
issue a command in the chat

205
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,750
it compiles it spits back a PDF they
click on it they see it easy

206
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,390
ok so so that's the way that we that we
have things set up so so really think a

207
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,420
lot of things are just sort of you know
interactions between you know from

208
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,569
rockets at to get lab handout sort of
and back

209
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,260
another thing i should actually also
mention that we've been doing I don't

210
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,530
have a slide about this but we've been
doing this increasingly often is also

211
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,800
even using Rock rocket chattin and chat
ops things also even more for not just

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,120
like you know also for our tools but
also for project management but and

213
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,120
we're actually using a were using Kanban
internally to manage our workflow for

214
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,230
our entire pen testing procedure well
process because of course we've got a

215
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,830
lot of members in the fire and we need
to like you know if you take care of

216
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,220
them

217
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,250
so what we're doing is we're also we
even implemented stuff you know from the

218
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,790
chat room that also even interact with
our the can board software that we are

219
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,560
using it so we can even be able to get
reminders and this is absolutely awesome

220
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,190
we're implementing right now we're a
reminder system so that if there is a

221
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,300
test on our can board that has been idle
for a week like for example if we sent

222
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,390
in a quotation to a customer and we
haven't heard anything back

223
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,140
it literally injects pings into the chat
room to remind us

224
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,830
yeah I am so it's really just turning
this this chat environment and to sort

225
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,330
of this you know control room if you
know for people distributed online to

226
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,899
just be able to you know kind of do all
this

227
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,569
for the whole pen test process and it's
really powerful and there's a lot of

228
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,248
something you can do that do with that

229
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,970
by the way also the reporting stuff this
is also just as quick screenshot of the

230
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,990
get left

231
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,040
I just you can also see how some of the
XML structure stuff is structured and

232
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,219
busy findings on findings report

233
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:19,369
oh it's probably a little bit less
interesting but in either case of other

234
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:24,769
things that we can do from the chat is
tools so we have already implemented

235
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:29,569
several kinds of tools of course we try
to open source them after we build them

236
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:33,979
one example of a tool that we
implemented the open source is a passive

237
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,910
scanning tool

238
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,519
so basically what it does is it takes
the outputs of showed on and also of

239
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,410
basically

240
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,699
well you see scans on iOS called census
now and what you can actually do is they

241
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,660
basically put in an IP address and then
basically you can spit out the

242
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,149
information that it gets from the
passive databases

243
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,259
you know a sort of passive recon wise to
you know be able to

244
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,120
well who is it I'll tell you you know
before you even start doing an active

245
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,609
attacks you know what some of the
problems might be because this is of

246
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,619
course useful stuff to report customers

247
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,158
you know the great thing about this is
if you can integrate the stuff of your

248
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,520
chat environment you can launch it from
the chat

249
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,949
you know it can run the scan it can
check the results in to get lab you know

250
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,990
and then we're also working right now on
basically some more basic scanning

251
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:31,280
good stuff we actually just a well-made
a partnership with sort of a large IT

252
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,450
insourcing company who also sort of
wants open source basic scanning and

253
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,480
we're actually trying to set up a bunch
of things right now with a whole suite

254
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,160
of the typical compliant scanning kinds
of tools like nmap nikto

255
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,990
you know just a well and SEO is a
checking ssl certificates you know these

256
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,740
kinds of things so that we can basically
do the scan checking in to get lab

257
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,160
trying like script you know right rights
and scripts to actually extract the

258
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,050
stuff out that we need and then put it
in the XML template so that when we

259
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,990
compile it can sort of put the right
thing into the right ways

260
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,070
so this is sort of the the automation
that we're busy yeah is he working on

261
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,970
it's a work in progress of course but
this is basically the direction that all

262
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,340
of our stuff is is going

263
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,730
and of course once its belt we're gonna
we're planning on open sourcing it

264
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,580
Oh another really novel thing that you
can do with this kind of a pen test

265
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,800
shadow ops environment is you can do
something called red blue pen testing

266
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:35,178
so what this is is I took with one of
our customers a development team for a

267
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,850
basically a software development team
for a product

268
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,980
ok and the software development team was
a number of coders number system mins

269
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,780
some dev ops people and what I did is I
split the team in half and I said okay

270
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,559
have fun you guys are the red team have
you guys in the blue team and each team

271
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:58,639
is basically guided by one of our
professional testers and we actually had

272
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,679
the customer do their own dentist

273
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,320
so we basically turned into kind of like
a CTF competition we gave a fight it and

274
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,909
we actually wrote our own scoreboard
that we use of course you bots for you

275
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,480
know the chat bot for so that if for
example somebody scored you can see

276
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,710
right now

277
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,480
like for example here a point for blue
for finding missing input validation

278
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,960
you know and so and then what we had
this thing is you could go good job blue

279
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,150
and then you can see now it says
incremented blue 24 points and then it

280
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,400
you know show you this like freaking
awesome

281
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,880
no rainbow unicorn I just perfect

282
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,300
you know and we basically had a pool of
images you know from the interweb so

283
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,510
does of silly stuff that we could spit
back to them you know what kind of a

284
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,410
game of light you know for what they
actually did something and we basically

285
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,890
it was a one-week contesto that we did
with the customer

286
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,430
we had 10 10 of their folks which of
course is a huge time investment for

287
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,090
them but you have to remember this is a
CTF exercise for them actually could you

288
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,720
know it's kind of like it's secure
coding training it you know in a way it

289
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,520
and at the end of the week they had
found 40 findings in their own product

290
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,070
they had found a full attack chain
through their own product ticket

291
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,850
you know and the best part about it was
they did it themselves

292
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,830
you know and and during the wrap-up
session with you know these guys

293
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,390
one of them literally said I am never
going to look at coding the same way

294
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,960
again

295
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,030
you know and that is precisely what we
want and we were able to do this

296
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,149
basically for the cost of a two-week pen
test for them you know one week of

297
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,540
actual pen testing of course one week
cleaning up the report that they made

298
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,540
because they made it incredibly
humongous mess out of it

299
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,729
it's not actually of course I just took
us a week to fix up the xml so we could

300
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,040
you give them a decent-looking report at
the end but you know that that's I mean

301
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,800
of course the real time investment for
them of course is that is the time of

302
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,810
you know 10 people for a week

303
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,020
if but you hope that the education that
they get out of it of course is it is

304
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,290
going to bear its fruits you know rather
continue to software development process

305
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,200
but this is really the great thing about
with the whole channel

306
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:17,130
I mean it really puts you on an equal
playing field just on an equal level you

307
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,490
know with your customers and especially
if you're online

308
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,620
geographically distributed team like my
company is it means that you know the

309
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,520
customers aren't even outsiders it's not
like were crowded in office working

310
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,090
together you can you know it's like you
know because our chat is our primary

311
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,699
communications platform it means that we
can actually fully adult and fully be

312
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,640
able to take along you know the customer
in a way that it's almost like

313
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,150
integrating them with our team and
that's only possible if you're working

314
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,090
online in this kind of chat environment

315
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,850
I mean even you know if you're working
in an office you tried inviting the

316
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,760
customer to your office i'm not even
sure you know to what extent that would

317
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,470
really be practical

318
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,250
you know but with this you don't you
basically all they need to do is just

319
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,270
have to have rockets at open and they
need to passively observe or actively

320
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,860
participate

321
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,469
so this is all really pretty great so
what else can we do

322
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,860
well you know there's a whole lot of
different things that you can integrate

323
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,899
with with chat

324
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,040
one example for of something else that
we did for our customers we actually

325
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,639
implemented a a spearfishing sweet

326
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,750
we're still cleaning it up at some point
when it's ready of course i also want

327
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:34,500
open sources as well but the point is
that what we're the way that it works is

328
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:41,310
that we had this number of scripts so
that we can do is actually instrument

329
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,710
create instrumented phishing emails and
then what would happen in

330
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,200
so the phishing emails would then have
links of course to something on a web

331
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,299
server Beckett clack click the track
interviews and of course also that could

332
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:03,830
attract a place and we actually had that
tied in with our chat environment so and

333
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,460
also the customer can even observe this
in real time so that every time one of

334
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,559
their employees either did an image of
you or click we were able to see it in

335
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,428
real time

336
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:19,700
so who you know and again instead of
giving a level of visibility into what

337
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,980
we're doing that is you know

338
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,510
cool quite frankly you know it's
actually it's fun because you can

339
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,020
basically launch launch it and then you
can basically just sit there and watch

340
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,000
you know the clicks come in

341
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,450
you know and watch the image of you to
come in so that's a that's actually

342
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,980
really pretty pretty fun

343
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,029
other things that you can launch of the
chat environment

344
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:43,850
I mean of course i already mentioned
they like scanning and exploitation

345
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:50,090
tools so any of your standard you know a
scanner scanning tools basically that

346
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,230
you would use your pen testing you can
probably automate it with rock with you

347
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,179
bought so that you can launch it from
the chat

348
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:02,179
so an absolutely three a sequel map I
drew for brute forcing stuff you know

349
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,789
this is all within the realm of
possibility

350
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:08,779
some of the stuff we've already
implemented from the chat other things

351
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,100
are on our to-do list

352
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,120
you know we're working on it but in
either case is what we envision things

353
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,418
like recon so who is google also as a
joke we implemented

354
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,950
let me google that for you but that
wasn't good enough then we had to

355
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,070
implement to let me . go that for you

356
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:33,860
so yeah and are passive scanning sweet
things like her biography

357
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,389
I mean things like hash cracking I mean
why shouldn't we be able to launch

358
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,649
you know hash cracking from from the
chat you know it's just convenient

359
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,540
so are other things that we can do email
and

360
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,350
SMS integration a wide region
spearfishing already

361
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,730
I mean basically anything in your in
your operations where you would need to

362
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,210
launch it and it makes it sort of
helpful you know if you can

363
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,080
another thing also is that if you have a
team working together

364
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,419
you know you're not going to get the
question of like hey what if you don't

365
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,470
already know and that makes also
coordinating a team really really easy

366
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,650
because they can each just look in the
chatroom see what the other person is

367
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,660
done looking get lab

368
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,960
another thing i should mention is we
also have to get look get hooks in the

369
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,830
chat room

370
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,939
so every time somebody doesn't commit to
get lab we basically get a report of

371
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,630
that

372
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,280
so both the you know the pen testing
team members as well as the customer

373
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,000
basically can see sort of blow by blow
every single check in that we're making

374
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,930
which means that we don't even
necessarily need to ask the question

375
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,130
have you already

376
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,310
you know done whatever because it's it's
just you know it's obvious from looking

377
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,690
fit

378
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,680
you know if so yeah so it just make
stuff really easy

379
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,410
anyway so this stuff is really at the
core of how we work

380
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,100
I mean I think it's a new workflow it's
an innovative work flow and it's one

381
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,469
that really is working extremely well
for us I hope you know hope we can

382
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,760
continue to you know be able to sort of
package these things up nicely and be

383
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,940
able to put it out there and get hub so
hopefully anybody can use it

384
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,570
I mean I would absolutely love to help
my competitors

385
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,889
ok you know that please use our tools
they're actually really quite awesome

386
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,300
you know if if if we as radically open
security can also help to make you know

387
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,120
the rest of the industry including our
competitors more awesome than that

388
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,199
that's even better

389
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,850
so I so please a you have a look at our
tools of you know and it's also open

390
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,899
source so if you guys do happen to use
it useful for you and you think hey this

391
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,550
is great but i really wish there was
also liked you know that are you put in

392
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,360
the future requests or even you know if
you do implement it you know

393
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
share the love and you know they can
give it back to us you know with a

394
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,189
suitable open source license as well

395
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,820
I mean it's basically just open source
so anyway this is going

396
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,169
I talk I hope you guys have thought it
but found thought provoking and I would

397
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,170
be extremely happy to answer any
questions

398
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:09,530
nope

399
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,700
how do we deploy it to ya

400
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:29,179
uh all right now I mean oh yeah I mean
we we just installed it there basically

401
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:35,630
on a vm so I mean it's not that we have
set up things have optimized yet to kind

402
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,650
of package it up so you can just at some
point that would really like for us to

403
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,220
use some kind of you know docker chef
and simple

404
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,450
you know that you know things so that we
can basically make it easier for other

405
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,010
people to set up of course right now I
mean we're still sort of innovating and

406
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,920
figuring it out so I mean right now
we've still been installing everything

407
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,680
manually several civilian and trying to
what Smith is ok sure

408
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:07,250
yeah contact me after please so what if
anybody else is actually interested in

409
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,430
trying out this stuff and working with
you know it i would certainly be very

410
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,480
happy

411
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,320
you know to work with you guys and think
along with you guys because you know we

412
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,620
ultimately it's better for us to do and
the more brains you have you

413
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,399
cool yourself one that being so are
there any questions

414
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,850
nope

415
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:32,330
ok oh yes I'm not as easy I'm just
wondering why I'm sure you know why

416
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:37,730
would I make it a non-profit oh I didn't
mention that because I was trying not to

417
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,960
make this is a you know a sales pitch
but doesn't know in a in a nutshell the

418
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,910
reason why i made our own is a
non-profit is because the market leaders

419
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,850
at least in the Netherlands for the
security industry are quite commercial

420
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,530
and not everybody in the hacker
community like that it you know because

421
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,418
hackers are very idealistic

422
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:59,600
I mean much like the open you know the
hacker community has a lot of close ties

423
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,889
with the open source community

424
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,220
we just want to make stuff better we
actually don't really care about money

425
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,480
not usually if you know you're making it
for our bosses that's completely years

426
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:18,380
so i think it is seriously so I wanted
to set up something that basically if

427
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,490
anybody got rich i really wanted it to
be a charity

428
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,270
you know something for the community so
I decided that we would support the NLF

429
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:30,168
foundation the internet foundation is
basically a foundation that's been

430
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:36,590
around for 15 years I have supported
projects like tour and eff & goo & jetty

431
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:40,549
and academic research and you know all
the kinds of stuff like makes the

432
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:41,690
internet better

433
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,470
good you know and we set ourselves up as
this thing called a fiscal fundraising

434
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,159
an institution and touch of disc golf
balls barefoot in spelling which means

435
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,309
that contractually we have to give
ninety percent of our profits to a

436
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:56,240
foundation and L that is that foundation
is actually a construction we stole from

437
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,630
the church's perfect seriously

438
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:05,340
because churches sometimes want to do
commercial spin-offs and then and then

439
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,678
they want to get the money tax-free back
to the church again

440
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,129
a famous example of this in the
Netherlands is a language institute

441
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:15,928
called a regina coeli and there's these
a nun's that are called the Nolan fun

442
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:16,559
food

443
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,158
it is actually this is actually the
language institute where queen maxima

444
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,840
learned and very much improved her Dutch
you know this is this is actually an

445
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,230
example of a fiscal fundraising
institution in the Netherlands

446
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,580
so we basically stole that idea but we
just decided to make an L met our church

447
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,389
so that that's a that's basically how
we're how are set up and you know and as

448
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,689
as for the rest of it openness
transparency open source i mean this is

449
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,759
definitely just like an attempt r OS is
an attempt to reclaim if you know

450
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,590
security consultancy for you know the
purposes of really making the world

451
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,189
better

452
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,309
through security because security is for
the common good

453
00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:00,418
it should be for the common good you
know if we can optimize for helping

454
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,360
customers you know our employees and
society instead of optimizing for

455
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,350
shareholders and investors and founders
and you know I mean ultimately you know

456
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,039
we hope to create a vehicle that will be
better for society in the end also want

457
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,399
a meta-level the whole concept of a
not-for-profit company we figure if we

458
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,428
can make this work in the computer
security space

459
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,749
who knows median like four or five years
we might be able to also teach workshops

460
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,580
you know explaining how other people can
do physical fundraising institutions in

461
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,749
other fields like healthcare agriculture
but you know so if you can just

462
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:39,929
demonstrate this as being a new kind of
social enterprise

463
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,039
you know maybe it'll be a cool idea that
other people can run with surprisingly

464
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,429
enough

465
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,059
actually as strange as this all sounds
because this is all really strange and

466
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:48,990
weird and different

467
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,539
this is actually really been taking off
r OS is now two years old but we already

468
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,590
have 40 freelancers working together

469
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,480
and we've already had more than 30
customers but that a third of which are

470
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,529
repeat customers could you know and at
least that probably you know two-thirds

471
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:10,789
of which are sort of the usual suspects
in terms of light touch a corporate life

472
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:15,140
government you know you know the other
30 days are like little not-for-profit

473
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:20,510
hippie organizations that are willing to
help for Ospreys physically so yeah so

474
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,700
that's kind of how it's a gone

475
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,419
you know we're hoping to shake up the
industry you know with the way that

476
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,890
we're working because what we hope is
that when the customer can look over our

477
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,710
shoulder we hope that they're going to
get so spoiled

478
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,460
but if you know by having that kind of
view that kind of visibility that amount

479
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,210
of knowledge transfer into their
organizations that i am hoping that they

480
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,049
are going to go

481
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:45,889
they're going to go back to our
competitors and say hey radically open

482
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,669
security is offering this people for our
shoulder service

483
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:53,360
can you guys do that - yeah and then
there

484
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,750
of course gonna have a choice you know
they can offer it for their customers

485
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,799
might walk away you know and in such a
way

486
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,570
we're hoping to make the entire industry
fit more open and transparent but you

487
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,970
know we're trying to offer that
alternative and raise the bar for

488
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,789
everyone you know and I hope that we can
do it

489
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,530
so maybe that's it that's enough about
that

490
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,970
the company anyway thank you so much for
your time and if anybody has any more

491
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,970
questions for me to be happy to take
them afterwards

492
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:27,030
so thank you
