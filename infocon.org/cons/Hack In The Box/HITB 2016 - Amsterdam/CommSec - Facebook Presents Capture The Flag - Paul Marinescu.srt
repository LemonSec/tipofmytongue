1
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,820
thanks so yeah I'm part of my

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,770
scientists that facebook in London I
work on infrastructure security which

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,680
means that sometimes I get involved in
organizing or helping organize capture

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,720
the flag events and a CTF is going on as
we speak

5
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,680
downstairs but I want to make sure we're
all on the same page so just briefly a

6
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,199
CTF he is a hacking simulation is a
competition where people have to solve

7
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:58,539
challenges which roughly fall into one
of these categories here and CBS our

8
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:06,789
Facebook Likes ETFs actually the month
of october at facebook is hacked over

9
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,789
which wear my t-shirt comes from

10
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:16,780
it's a month-long CTF kind of thing and
and people have a lot of fun

11
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:25,210
so what happened two weeks ago is that
Facebook released the CDF platform that

12
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,770
we've been using for a while now to
organize contest and well as you can see

13
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,259
we got pretty good

14
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:44,950
media coverage and from the headlines
you can see it's an educational tool and

15
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,079
i'll get to that in a bit

16
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,479
so you might be wondering why facebook
is investing in in CTFs and why facebook

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,329
has open sourced the platform after
after what we've built it and it's

18
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,320
actually

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,100
it makes a lot of sense if you look at
the market intelligence reports

20
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:13,720
this is from from last year the demand
for information security specialists is

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:21,190
growing faster than the demand for
general IT jobs which in turn is growing

22
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,570
faster than than the demand for the
average job market

23
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,930
so the demand is growing fast

24
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,570
but the supply is not growing as fast
and the US bureau of labor statistics

25
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,040
put up some numbers some predictions
that in a few years we'll have a lot of

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,970
this positions in information security
on the field and Facebook will be

27
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:59,709
affected by this because we employ a lot
of information security specialist

28
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:07,780
so at facebook we have security
engineers and not only that we have this

29
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,450
white hat program also known as the bug
bounty program where third party

30
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:20,140
security researchers can send bug
reports and we verify them

31
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:30,420
we hate them for that bounty and as a
random fact facebook page about one and

32
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,880
a half million dollars per year on one
bug reports in bug bounties

33
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,460
so why do we have this shortage of
specialists well partly because there

34
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,040
are not that many courses in school

35
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,630
there are not that many educational
tools for security and we're trying to

36
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,109
contribute to make the things better by
using CTFs as an alternate teaching tool

37
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:13,770
and CTS can actually have an impact on a
person's knowledge there's a lot of

38
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,270
hands-on work

39
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,329
there's a lot of technical skills that
you can get by participating in in cts

40
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:29,940
so in in 2013 facebook started building
a platform for capture the flag and this

41
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,730
is a picture from the archives

42
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:43,350
that's the the initial platform that we
had and this is the team that started

43
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:50,730
this and they've organized a lot of cts
in various places starting from middle

44
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,190
schools to security competitions like
the current conferences like this one

45
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:04,110
and many places in between and they had
so much success that they

46
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:13,188
I wouldn't essentially handle the load
of organizing all this so it became

47
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:24,020
clear that we have to take ourselves out
of out of this and provide a way for

48
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,498
people to organize city of them do it
themselves and at the same time around

49
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:38,059
2014 the open source movement was
gaining traction

50
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,110
more more traction at facebook so that
was the natural thing to do to open

51
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:51,860
source the platform and one year later
after a complete rewrite of the whole

52
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,699
system

53
00:05:52,699 --> 00:06:00,050
we are here i'll get back to this to
this in a moment face because the github

54
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,669
repository there are tens maybe hundreds
of projects there by the way

55
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:09,649
so here we are this is the new platform

56
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,149
this is from a competition that happened
in cambridge one month ago

57
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,609
I'll talk about that a bit if we still
have time

58
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,180
so yeah I had I had the movie here and
then I had some

59
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,620
some screen shots but i'll try to do a
live demo and see if that works first

60
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,759
so one it's fairly easy to get
everything set up

61
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:45,159
you clone this repository and you do a
vagrant up that reads the configuration

62
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,770
file and creates a virtual machine and
then provisions the machine as in it

63
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:57,219
installed everything from the web server
the database server that's needed to run

64
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:04,810
that and then you just point your
browser to to the to the port that was

65
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,849
open on the virtual machine

66
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:13,630
so let's see I've already done that
because it takes it takes a bit to set

67
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,409
it up p

68
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:22,210
there's a lot of stuff that needs to be
downloaded and yeah here we here we are

69
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,060
this is this is the login page d admin
account is already created

70
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,150
and

71
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,719
well I hope you can you can see most of
these the text is a bit blurry on the

72
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,580
projector

73
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,830
so you see a registration is on and we
have open registration which means that

74
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,340
anyone can register but for the purpose
of this demo let's do a tokenized

75
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:10,479
registration and this means that only
people who have tokens can register and

76
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:20,560
let's create some tokens and that's
register so this is team whole password

77
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Paul and i'm just going to paste here
the token

78
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,780
yeah i'm going to be this guy and I'm
going to sign up and the the contest

79
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,010
hasn't started so the game clock isn't
running you have various widgets here

80
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,429
and that you here you see the teams and
the rankings here

81
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:49,630
well again the team logos you can filter
you can filter the challenges by by

82
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,400
different categories but since the
contest hasn't started there are no

83
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,590
challenges on the map

84
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:03,760
so on let's just start the game and it's
well you can select here how long the

85
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,790
game should last three hours that's
enough

86
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,980
and yeah let's start

87
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,880
so now if we go at the same page you can
see that the clock is ticking

88
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:28,120
we still have no no challenges on the
map the map is black so of course you

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,900
need to add challenges and i've added
one but it's turned off the intensity is

90
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,130
usually don't want to put all done all
the challenges at once at the beginning

91
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
so let's turn this on and now

92
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:52,780
well ukraine became mom light gray and
yeah we we have this challenge here

93
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,720
it's 20 points and I think the answer
was back in the box

94
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,630
there's a need more points here this is
the hint system you can buy hints with

95
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,300
points but since i haven't solved any
challenges I have no . so i cannot buy

96
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,520
it and yeah it's green is good and I'm
the first now with 50 points

97
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,600
so this was a quiz this was a very
simple question that didn't require

98
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
solving much

99
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,260
there are also flags flags are a bit
more complicated

100
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,479
so usually you

101
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,620
you provide the contestants with the IP
of a machine where they have to that

102
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,370
they have to hack where you give them a
file that they have to download so well

103
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:57,970
let's see let's turn this on this is
Canada and yet Canada just became active

104
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:06,070
and you have to extract the text from
the attached file well there is no

105
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,240
attached file because i haven't attached
to it yet but i will now

106
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:23,719
and i will select the file and let's
just use a random file and now going

107
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,830
back

108
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:33,770
yeah here we are we can we can on
download the file attached and somehow

109
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,569
extracted the text

110
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,470
well this is just an image so it's going
to show up as an image in the browser

111
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,350
because that's what i've uploaded

112
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:50,839
we're going to extract the flag and well
maybe the flag that i found is flag but

113
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,100
this is not right

114
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:01,970
this and we can look at the answer the
answer is well and you submit it and

115
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,560
here you go

116
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:11,689
we have conquered canada and there are a
few other things here and there's even a

117
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,900
tutorial which is kind of aligned with
our target audience

118
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:22,970
they gives you a very quick overview of
the various parts of of the platform the

119
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,870
clock

120
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,730
what do the signs on the country's mean
that you can you can zoom and there's

121
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,329
even a command line that I've never do

122
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:43,238
I've never reduced so yeah that's that's
the gist of it

123
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:49,299
oh and there's also scoreboard which
hear it well looks kind of boring

124
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:54,879
because they're just one team and
there's not much to see but i'll show

125
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,420
you the scoreboard from from the
cambridge competition and that looks

126
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,649
more interesting

127
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,360
so let's get back to the slides

128
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,679
yeah so you can you can do it yourself

129
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:15,860
it definitely is definitely works on OSX
and definitely works on on

130
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:23,360
some linux's you might run into trouble
on other than access for reasons that

131
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,810
are not exactly clear but we're getting
to that

132
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,950
so as you've seen you also need
challenges to run a CTF and we do have a

133
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:40,519
library of challenges that we've used
since we started organizing them and

134
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,570
where we were

135
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,910
we're not making it public for obvious
reasons but if you want to organize the

136
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,449
cpf we can we can give them to you to
bootstrap

137
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,769
but of course any any serious
competition will want some new

138
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:56,630
challenges as well

139
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,260
tom so two weeks later

140
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,569
two weeks later from the moment when
when we open source this the the github

141
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:14,149
repository has I would say very good
community around it

142
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,230
well for him the Stars a lot of forks

143
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,079
there are third-party contributions
there are people who have written more

144
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,079
detailed tutorials on how to set this up

145
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:32,870
well they've also put their affiliate
link to the hosting provider but that's

146
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,220
fine

147
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:42,500
so I think this is going in the right
direction for what we want to do and

148
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,570
under the hood

149
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:50,779
there are a lot of Facebook technologies
these doubles as a technological demo

150
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,529
for some of the other projects that
we've open sourced it's written in hack

151
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:57,019
hack is the same thing that

152
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:04,160
facebook.com is written in and runs runs
on this virtual machine called HTM xhp

153
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:12,290
is the template system and flow is a is
a JavaScript type checker that they all

154
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,099
come from

155
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:21,050
they'll come from facebook i did mention
before the bug bounty program so we may

156
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:26,540
researchers security researchers
bounties for bugs that they found in I

157
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,760
that they find in our systems we also
pay bounties for bugs that they find in

158
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,300
the city of platform and yeah we've had
one so far

159
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,890
and that's about it about regarding the
regarding the platform manager is going

160
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:52,699
to spend a few more minutes telling you
about what we've done in cambridge one

161
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:01,940
month ago it was captured the flag
between well in the in the UK there are

162
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,670
this academic centers of excellence in
cyber security research 13 universities

163
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,270
have been blessed with this title by
while the government essentially and

164
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:22,730
none of them participated at a CTF in in
cambridge in the University it

165
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,730
the local organizers did a great job

166
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,820
there was a big cup not sure if you can
tell from the picture but it was pretty

167
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:40,490
big and there were medals and there were
actually two parallel CTFs that with

168
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,020
we've done because not everyone could
fit in the room that we had there so we

169
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:56,360
have done a parallel one that was
happening online and well you'll see at

170
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,030
the end who was the winner

171
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:08,030
um and regarding organization the local
organizers also had a very good social

172
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,280
event after that and I was I was pretty
surprised that a lot of people were

173
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,000
there including the press including the
industry including even the the GCHQ the

174
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,480
GCHQ is the UK equivalent of the NSA

175
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:31,610
so I would say that that's popular at
least

176
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:41,389
yeah so it it was a five hour event and
we had 30 challenges or we prepared the

177
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,310
challenges at Facebook we had quizzes

178
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:52,970
you've seen the quiz in the the simple
kind of question we had the same number

179
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,920
of flags the flags are things that you
have to work a bit too to get the answer

180
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,760
and we had one base which is a king of
the hill kind of thing

181
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,020
it's it's different than the two armed

182
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:14,060
there is one box that teams can
compromise and only one team can be the

183
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,820
king of the box at any given time and
they get points for every second that

184
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,929
they own the box and of course other
teams can get not

185
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,440
ownership if they managed to bypass

186
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:35,280
well whatever the first input on to
protect the box in the first place and

187
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,410
what we also had and turned out really
well where guests challenges so each of

188
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,150
the teams were allowed to send one guest
challenge which was kind of fun because

189
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:56,040
you are you are conquering one of your
adversary's and we were pretty impressed

190
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,310
that from all these challenges just to
our left unsolved

191
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,680
we've also organize the same thing the
year before and I can definitely say

192
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,200
that the level has gone up quite a lot
and they will do that were left on slov

193
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,410
were pretty hard

194
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,590
we used amazon ec2 to host everything it
makes a lot of sense to use Amazon

195
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:30,090
because well they were up for five or
six hours and we use three instances for

196
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:38,010
4h cpf and yeah this was the this was
the final ranking there

197
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,000
as you can see cambridge one well quite
by a long shot

198
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,740
and well some of the teams picked up

199
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:59,540
names that are not very revealing as of
what university it is number three is

200
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,420
southampton number four is royal
holloway well it doesn't really matter

201
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,160
that much

202
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:22,340
so yeah that that was that was it thanks
