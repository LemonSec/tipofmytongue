1
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,439
good afternoon everyone thank you so
much and you are waiting until now for

2
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,590
the last presentation in this afternoon

3
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:31,869
um my name is hauling come from achieve
with three succeed and our team is it is

4
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,869
focusing on the radio and hardware
security

5
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:45,099
ok on my presentation today is about the
the LT security about a a kind of attack

6
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:53,680
to really react to the cell phone in to
downgrade into the a week secure network

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:07,479
ok and we know that on 14 I work IE the
LTE network is more advanced secured but

8
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,420
it doesn't mean it

9
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,220
absolutely safe so and in last year in
the black hat Europe some there

10
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:25,929
there are presentations introduce the
LTM see character and does attack over

11
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,550
LTE network

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:36,310
this picture shows the tool that you use
a laptop + usrp we will also use such

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,760
tools to do further attack to do

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,170
re direction ok let's first to see the
two

15
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,320
no one attacked types

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,350
the first one is about NC catcher

17
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,070
you can see the Left Party is the real
LTE network controlled by operator and

18
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,759
the attacker can be used out of apt
network

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,879
the smaller one which covers a narrow
coverage area

20
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:18,640
ok once is the iphone enter into this
area it will try to attach on this fake

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,869
network and

22
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,110
that work we asked the cell phone to
send it

23
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:33,379
imsi number this number will be reported
to the fake network then we can get the

24
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:41,569
how to say the unit energy and a
identification about yourself though

25
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,780
mmm

26
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,170
as I know there are some National
Security department's are using such

27
00:02:51,170 --> 00:03:01,220
device to trike some criminal suspect
and i also heard some rumor that there

28
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:09,019
there are some under casinos that you're
such a device and putting nearby the

29
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:16,909
casino to know if there are strangers
come near body and then we'll get an

30
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,599
alert

31
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:29,899
so anyway from the network side we don't
wish such active equipment to influence

32
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:38,599
the existing network right no matter its
by government or by some illegal

33
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,599
entities the second attack example is
voted

34
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:54,440
that's the type in this case yes we also
use the fake out in our world and after

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,970
after the cell phones standards MZ
number to the network network will send

36
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,780
back to as attached reject message

37
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,040
this national message will carrier some
special courses this courses will make

38
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,909
the cell phone shut down his model and
they not connected to the network for a

39
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,660
very very long time so it is court at .

40
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,720
mmm for me

41
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:39,210
we do we will i did a further step after
we send the attacker rejected message

42
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:46,890
I added some further information that
course redirection message

43
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,969
this message will tell the cell phone up

44
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,390
ok you come into my gps gsm network

45
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,760
what is this just a network it is also
be used by the attacker

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,080
it can be a a fake network

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,680
I mean it may be built by open BTW
software but also can be other militias

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,770
2g or 3G network

49
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:21,570
so in this case when out as long as the
cell phone enter into this week network

50
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:28,770
to 2d or 3g the boys or data traffic can
be enjoyed by the attacker

51
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,849
this is the risk of this attack

52
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:43,530
mmm usually people will argue that we
could use some other simple way like

53
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,409
Jamie Jamie signal right you can

54
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,390
german the existing 40 network and then
the cell phone will automatically for

55
00:05:51,390 --> 00:06:02,099
some grated to 2d or 3d right but the
advantage of this attack is you can

56
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,419
choose the target

57
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:12,150
you can choose to tell this cell phone
go to that level and tell other cell

58
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:19,289
phones go to operators 4g network so the

59
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,770
the other people will not will be not
influenced by your attack right

60
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:36,789
hmm i will show a demo to you but
firstly I want to introduce the the

61
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:47,949
system that the platform we use the left
part is a fake gsm network we use one

62
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,860
laptop and plus the u.s. RP

63
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,250
this is usrp be 200 and be 200 mini type

64
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:06,580
ok we run the open be 10 software on it
and the right one is the desktop or mini

65
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,219
size the bigger bite you

66
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,610
and we then also us simply be

67
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:22,030
- 10 this computer runs the open LTS of
the where it creates a fake LTE network

68
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:33,940
here is a short video and because then
the whole procedure for the cell phone

69
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,669
turn from the real network to our fake
40 network then to the fake to the

70
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:45,010
network is the very very quick process
right so the video is very short

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,659
only one minute so please watch it
carefully

72
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,729
this computer created for the network

73
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:06,520
we sent attached to direct reject to the
this MC number that we rented to a given

74
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,620
frequency

75
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:18,970
this is an iphone he received a message
and keep staying in this in this fake

76
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,840
network cannot go back to the real now
let's check the computer to defect

77
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,869
network the cell phone

78
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,340
MC blah blah blah is in this to defect
network

79
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,209
ok

80
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:49,209
yeah

81
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:04,580
these slides on I want to discuss the
risk of this attack as i said before we

82
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:12,830
can use fake base station and we also
can use a Rob base station

83
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,370
what the difference if we force the cell
phone into a fake network the cell phone

84
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,590
will have no service

85
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:30,350
this means the cell phone cannot connect
to the real internet but we still can do

86
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:39,080
something we can make militia score and
make to send SMS with any cording number

87
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:50,900
this is quite used for and in another
case if we beauty & rug network like

88
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,860
this picture

89
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:59,810
this is the femtocell we have to last
year our team happied we also give the

90
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:06,680
presentation last year's . com to
introduce search how to having a

91
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:17,180
femtocell so this is the authorized them
to sell and it can connect to the the

92
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,469
operators network

93
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,040
so if we force the cell phone into a
surgeon them to sell or the traffic

94
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,819
the real traffic can be be dropped by
the attacker

95
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,820
this is more dangerous

96
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:46,089
and from this life are i will introduce
the principle of how the attack realize

97
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:57,040
we can see here this is the basic
procedure when the cell phone a power on

98
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,800
and then could connect to the network it
will firstly search the neighboring cell

99
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,760
and find a cell has passed a signal

100
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:15,220
mm and try to connect with it it will be
built RC connection and sent RC

101
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,600
connection res request and then set up
the connection server will firstly sent

102
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,220
attach your request

103
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,399
I mean I want to attach this network and
then the self the network will give

104
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,329
feedback

105
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,989
ok if this is then normal cell phone and
normal network the authentication

106
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,459
procedure will be successfully completed
right

107
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:52,390
so from this red line the below part the
the green part are the faith part and

108
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,069
about this green line here is the attack
space

109
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,899
this part has no encryption so we can do
many things in this space

110
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:09,310
the three attack in the catcher

111
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:19,349
does attack and also LT reduction re
direction are all happening with space

112
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,380
let's see the the first check in the
catcher

113
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,700
how it realized can you see it

114
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,430
um here firstly the RC connection is
beaut

115
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,599
and here you can see it's the cell phone
standard training area of the reject

116
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,350
message

117
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:50,100
what does it mean usually the cell phone
staying in the operators network and he

118
00:12:50,100 --> 00:13:02,220
it it it will not directly send its MZ
number to a new Playstation because it

119
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,550
want to avoid expose his ID

120
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:12,030
so usually it will send a temporary ID
to the network by this training area

121
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,420
update message through this message

122
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,770
the network will know oh ok the cell
phone is moving into another base

123
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,470
station and his position is updated

124
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,310
right so cell phone will firstly send
this tau request message

125
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:38,280
our fake network has received this
message it will send a Tau reject this

126
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:47,160
message will tell the the cell phone
with the very specific reason

127
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,819
tell the the cell phone I don't know
your ID

128
00:13:51,330 --> 00:14:01,710
okay i have no information about you
please tell me who you are and so the

129
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,920
cell phone receive this reason he
started a attached procedure in this

130
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,380
attached here

131
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:18,330
the attached request the MZ number is
included and then are in the catcher is

132
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,870
realized

133
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:28,900
ok the second the second example is a
dozen attack right

134
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:37,900
and after this step here after the
attached request and stand out the fig

135
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,560
LTE network will send back the next
message is attached to reject this

136
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,589
reject message also can bring some
courses

137
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:54,670
the reason why I reject you i tested
many of the courses i found the four of

138
00:14:54,670 --> 00:15:00,880
them are very useful for example number
three number seven eight and 14

139
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:08,080
what what does this mean for example for
number three

140
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,190
it means you are illegals helpful

141
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,770
tell the cell phone you are illegal so
the cell phone stopped connecting to

142
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:26,949
network and to end to do nothing and for
seven eight and 14

143
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:35,529
they are all related to like tell the
cell phone here i have no service no GPS

144
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,890
no 3g and no 2g network available

145
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,459
no network tell the cell phone so
selfish a dice model do nothing

146
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,410
then toss attack realized right

147
00:15:54,449 --> 00:16:02,160
the third attack do the first step after
after attaching reject the message when

148
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,129
we ascended the attached reject message

149
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:15,959
I add a see the red worse redirected
carrier in for added to the rrc

150
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:23,729
connection relief message in this
message we will tell the cell phone

151
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:32,250
okay you should go to frequency blah
blah blah blah and a GS n or r wcdma

152
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:41,430
problem then the cell phone will follow
the command and enter into your target

153
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,430
Network old

154
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,560
ok and after I introduce the the
principal

155
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,670
I will tell you how to build it

156
00:16:53,670 --> 00:17:03,000
it's not difficult you just use the
computer and a usrp or played I've the

157
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,530
airport's ok

158
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:13,349
we use a small size the desktop and us
happy b - 10

159
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,900
there are some popular open source

160
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,559
LT project two of the month

161
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,149
Barry favors the first one is open air
interface by ear come

162
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:35,639
france this is the most of completed and
open source out he software

163
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:43,640
and it can support connecting cell phone
to internet it means if you build an OA

164
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,630
I network in your lap in your lap

165
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,920
it can be a privacy network for you

166
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:59,570
I it really can connect to the
commercial cell phone but the short time

167
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,149
you have this projector is alway I have
a complicated software architecture

168
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:12,350
so it is a little difficult for new
starter to reprogram it to modify the

169
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,090
code

170
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:22,580
the second project named open LTE region
by been written by only one person

171
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,090
because it made him buy only one person

172
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,899
so the cold architecture is very
beautiful and I like this color motor

173
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,100
action

174
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:43,159
mmm so it's more popular in the security
researchers and but but there should the

175
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,050
disadvantage of this opening out he is
it having to achieve stable

176
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:56,330
LT data connection but for fake network
its functional enough so we finally

177
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,330
decided to use open Lt

178
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:07,040
I show you the detailed cold here if you
want to try this test

179
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:16,670
please remember we're to modify the code
in current open LT release the Tau

180
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,060
taking our update request isn't handled
you can see here is a red red red red

181
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,040
sentence

182
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,379
where's my mouse not handling training
area update request

183
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:38,480
the bad part but the reject message
packing function is available

184
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:45,290
so what we need to do is just the simple
learning use this function and added

185
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,780
some handling code to handle this tau
procedure

186
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,399
it seems all right

187
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,690
oh here is the eye

188
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,760
I mean you can handle the T you reject

189
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,600
ok for the seven to attack

190
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:17,570
I mean the doss attack remember how how
we realize that we sent to attach

191
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:25,250
rejection with some special courses
right let's see the source code here the

192
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,520
function is send attached reject

193
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,800
ok this function has a parameter is the
TMM course

194
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,470
you just need to feel this natural
causes here then the cell phone will

195
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,470
really

196
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:50,539
we test allowed to our cell phones
especially iphones almost all the

197
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:57,710
iphones will is influenced by this
attack and some of the android cell

198
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:05,059
phones are you influenced and for the
third attack it's a little complicated

199
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,280
you have to read this region vp
specification and to know how to

200
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,178
construct the redirection that message
here

201
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,440
you need to write every the redirect to
camera in for message and inserted into

202
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,720
the RC connector release message

203
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,120
this this Factory is here are CPAC
connection release message

204
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,830
we need to add something here below for
this missing the rice the right picture

205
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:52,280
you may not see it clearly is a
screenshot from our test to cell phone

206
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,600
this emily is

207
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,949
for debugging purposes see it has
logging logging function

208
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:04,850
so here is the log I can verify from the
log that the cell phone

209
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:12,260
t to receive the direction for for
example here this is a GE ren that means

210
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,910
a gsm and starting a rfp and number is
42

211
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,090
this is the frequency number so the cell
phone we're following the the come on go

212
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:31,760
to the frequency 42 self cell into that

213
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:47,178
ok before they'll slide or the the
previous part i introduce how to do the

214
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:47,960
attack

215
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:59,780
okay but I'm not a very how to say and i
have not very strong attack capability

216
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,658
and I I i I'm a lack of the imagination
how to do bad things

217
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,960
so usually I i will stand at the
defender side and to think of why why

218
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,270
there is some vulnerability

219
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:24,590
why is ours the redirection masuk not
encrypted if there are some reason i

220
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,020
asked some of those three DP
standardization experts and I'm fine

221
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,530
my phone is not new

222
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,960
this is not a new problem problem and i
found a very old document in almost 10

223
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:51,140
years ago in generate 2006 gdp has a
document here they introduced the forest

224
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,580
and over attack

225
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,740
so this part a compromise the

226
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,850
a network an initiate a reconfiguration
procedure with the ue directing it to a

227
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,580
ser or network chosen by the attacker

228
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,059
this could function as a denial of
service

229
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:16,960
if the target Network a not or will not
offer the US service or too low a chosen

230
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,400
network to capture use this is exactly
what we did but just at that time they

231
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:33,070
they theoretically say there is such
attack but nowadays we realize it by

232
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,159
very low cost of equipment and open
source software

233
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:42,700
mmm

234
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:51,130
and i also find just a 10 months later
in november two thousand and six three

235
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,050
we made the decision

236
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,480
how to handle such attack

237
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,890
let's see the two points the first one

238
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,950
RC signal in creepy and ciphering
suffering will be starting only once

239
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,670
during the attack that attach procedure

240
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:23,080
I after the AK has been performed and
cannot be d attack the active later but

241
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,530
notice the second . are the integrating
and suffering algorithm can only be

242
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:38,320
changed in the case of the ill be hand
over 30 people give the exception on the

243
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,260
encryption algorithm here give a
exception

244
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,830
why why do such while I made such a
decision

245
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:59,300
the Act the standardization act for told
me in sums better cases for example in

246
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:06,200
earthquake ordering some hard events
that we will there will be too many cell

247
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:13,130
phone try to access one playstation like
this picture showed a lot of the base

248
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,929
station is for loaded

249
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,870
maybe only one or two a station is like
loading so they need some scheme to tell

250
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,800
the cell phone

251
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,070
go to the light loaded cell phone

252
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:31,220
this compound what why it it

253
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,730
ignore the authentication procedure
because the heavy loaded playstation has

254
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:49,040
no more resource to complete the
authentication so they wish they called

255
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,300
tell the cell phone

256
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,540
well go to the light go to the green one

257
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:58,520
it is light and loaded mmm

258
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:10,460
if someone argue that why the cell phone
can not auto select another base station

259
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,879
if you don't tell the cell phone which
position is loaded the cell phone where

260
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,950
blindly and inefficiently search one by
one and this action will increase the

261
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,300
whole network globe

262
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:32,780
so this is the reason why such RC

263
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,810
re Direction signal is not encrypted

264
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:50,090
ok this light I i show a show not only
the redirection attack reason but also

265
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,290
the other attack the reason here to the
left apart

266
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:06,350
the first one is global room roaming the
most the best advantage of cellular

267
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,830
network is it has global roaming
function right

268
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:20,780
mm that's this y MC character is always
successful because i can give another

269
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:30,800
example the you know Wi-Fi in Wi-Fi
system attacker can tweak your mac

270
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:40,129
address right to know your position and
we also know after iOS 8 and Windows pen

271
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:47,360
there's some method to randomize the
marker dress to protect your privacy

272
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:57,110
right but we also know this random
randomized Michael dress only happen

273
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:08,120
under a very strict conditions and there
is an exception if you want to use let's

274
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:17,270
say Wi-Fi hotspot 2.0 specification that
hop hardest part 2.0 is a Wi-Fi roaming

275
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:23,540
specification as long as you enable
Wi-Fi roaming the market address

276
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:32,179
randomization is disabled that the
reason is if you want to row me you need

277
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,610
to tell the network who you are you need
to first give your ID and then the

278
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,820
network can authorize you right

279
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:51,340
so the roaming and MC catcher is
conflicting the designer has to make put

280
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,629
a trade-off between that and also for
does attack

281
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:06,970
this is considering to save the battery
energy suppose if it is environment

282
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,380
there's really no network the network is
broken

283
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,810
no service so if your cell phone is keep
searching searching that that that that

284
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:26,530
work and try to attach the battery
energy will quickly consumed out so the

285
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,700
designer use such a scheme to save
battery energy

286
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,070
ok so the the third Lyons

287
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,710
this is a completing pair and load
balance every direction

288
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:51,070
attack um I i want to say that when we
designing a network

289
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,939
we are firstly consider its basic
requirement to provide network

290
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:07,630
availability to user and privacy is a
little higher level requirement right so

291
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,630
it's difficult to make the trade off

292
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,640
but that's reading mmm we can do nothing

293
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:27,670
No for example i discussed there with
this because the 360 also has a cell

294
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,530
phone making cell phone ok so we
discussed with the cell phone and

295
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:40,600
engineers we think for the self many of
factors side we could use to matter

296
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,990
for example scheme 1 let the cell phone
don't follow the direction come on

297
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:54,430
but Otto search either available base
station and for a and and the second

298
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:01,060
method is let the cell phone follow the
redirection command but raisin alert to

299
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,399
the cell phone user for example you can
see and a red alert on your cell phone

300
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,030
are you are hungry day too low security
network

301
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,220
do you accept it you can manually choose
accept or not

302
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:29,110
and we know the root of this problem is
due to the weak security of legacy

303
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,260
networks 3g and Turkey right

304
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:43,930
so from a standardization side they
think it's it it should fix the week

305
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:50,200
security of legacy network it that means
the gsm they want to want to fix it

306
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:57,460
how to fix it this is a very old Network
and there are many old network equipment

307
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,130
is very difficult to do upgrade

308
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,310
so how to do mmm

309
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:10,090
here is a very very very very fresh news

310
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,000
this meeting happen just in this mouth
to wisco two weeks ago

311
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,169
there is a 3gpp as a meeting in this
meeting

312
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:34,120
gsma sand and lion statement to 3gp this
document gives some proposal for legacy

313
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,750
security issues and mitigation proposal
for this proposal the basic idea is they

314
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:48,520
want to upgrade the self inside that
means for example the future self on the

315
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,000
future self from chip that will have

316
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:02,149
he has security scheme here here are the
two examples example

317
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:11,328
the first one is the future cell phone
may refuse one way authentication in gsm

318
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:20,149
for example 1 a cell phone is in the
visited at work and you know this

319
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,230
visiting at work has 3g of the
capability for example we visitor

320
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:32,929
absolutely amsterdam here and you know
he appear has 2g 3G and 4G right and

321
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:41,210
this cell phone should use 3g or 4g to
do the the two-way authentication

322
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:50,990
it must use that for bio refuses one way
with education on this visit in our but

323
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:58,368
when it is a cell phone in some very old
Network like

324
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:06,440
africa africa area there is only a very
old 2g network then the cell phone has

325
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,690
to be used the one where your education

326
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,760
so it guarantee the network at a capable
network availability

327
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:23,569
the second the master is to disabling
the compromise encryption mobile

328
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:35,328
that means we know that in gsm network
the a 5-1 algorithm is already broken by

329
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:36,050
hacker

330
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:45,230
I so this method means the cell phone
should not use a 5-1 but use better

331
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:57,290
encryption algorithm in the mobile so we
can see this is a good start good start

332
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:06,619
for standardization entities they are
trying to fix the problem okay

333
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:13,940
that's all my presentation and finally I
want to say thank you to some friends

334
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,280
from our way

335
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,340
Peter with Lee is also here today

336
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:27,680
mm and two to three DP standardization
explore score e is murdering the rent

337
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:34,069
generalization and changing is a siii
expert and also sends to call home

338
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:42,290
go away he discussed with me
the-the-the-the security a problem on

339
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,210
the cops chipset and also thanks to the
apple productive security team

340
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,350
ok thank you order

341
00:36:51,350 --> 00:37:01,190
thank you for your patience thank you we
have some time for questions

342
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,420
I think it's clear very clear right

343
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,780
yes thank you the technical details were
really good i guess i'm curious to do

344
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,340
the LTE protocol do you have to have
higher bandwidth and what hardware

345
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,350
platform you're using a lot of the
consumer-grade stuff like radar radar f4

346
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,830
sorry could you slow down and use a
simple english worse

347
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,790
oh ok so uh what hardware platform are
you using

348
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:46,700
and as the LTE emulation require higher
bandwidth than the gsm ah doing the u.s.

349
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,480
RP

350
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,920
yeah yes I I think us happy to a date
this board has very wide band wife

351
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,950
so it's be 200 yes no problem

352
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:08,060
ok thanks any other questions then thank
you very much thank you
