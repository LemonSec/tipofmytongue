1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,930
thank you very much my name is

2
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,700
Mary or most of the people know me by
fish I do have a few logos i got a lot

3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,450
of more but one of the logos is random
data which is a hackerspace in Utrecht

4
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,000
and since i'm also a dad

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,170
I was involved in the past five years
when my kids growing up doing more

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,590
technical stuff and I'm making my uh i'm
gonna i got a job with the s unit which

7
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,790
is the company's doing offensive stuff
and we break a lot of things and with

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,280
this we are also able to do these kind
of things

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
and as i said i'm part of the heb core
crew

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,530
i'm not i do we did not did not did not
start this project alone

11
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm actually I spoke with with hero
which is over here

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,110
hero and I had a chat we had a phone
call

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,220
actually was not that phone wasn't here
ok

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,270
and we were talking about our kids about
that they are in school

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,479
well what kind of technical stuff do
they learn on schools and it was kind of

16
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,039
sad actually we had the conclusion that
hacking was not in a close yet so we

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,950
came up to the ID at the school fair 02
to run a pilot and we call it hack in a

18
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,619
class and during our journey we spoke
about with a lot of people about his ID

19
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,400
and everyone here

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,979
hey but this is cool i also want to want
to know about it and and so we are on

21
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,060
the beginning of a journey at a clause
is still very small but we have a lot of

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,140
people who want to have attention for
this and to organize a little bit you

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,590
know it's just it's not an initiative if
we just are starting on the school

24
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,790
running running a hacking class now you
have to think much different in their

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,390
way

26
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,200
like okay how we're going to do it
responsible responsible for example and

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,399
and how we're going to extend this and
and is it even our tickets waiting for

28
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,459
this or they are just bored and they
want to play there on the playstation or

29
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,970
whatever so and and this journey started
a few weeks ago and during this during

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,010
we thought about we need to grow this we
need to make this bigger and and and see

31
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,560
if we can launch this at least in a way
that is sustainable and more people can

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,430
use it

33
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,300
so what I'm going to give you I'm going
to give you an introduction

34
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,740
what about hacking a clause but we're
still in the it's still an alpha project

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,010
so we are on the beginning of the
journey and we need a lot of people

36
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,500
joining is and this will be the formal
announcement of hacking class but we

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,800
don't know where it's going yet and I
think that's a good happy way to at

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
least bring hacking to the classroom

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm one of the things i will we were
working on is our vision

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,460
first of all we do see a lot of schools
trying and and see how they can extend a

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,510
lot of things but they don't know how
the second thing to get

42
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,600
it's also that we see lots of schools
are are are not able to go out of the

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,989
standard curriculum which means that
they are trying to give everybody a 6

44
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:26,030
plus or something like a 22 to gain
their to fix their access etc and and

45
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,920
packing is actually just outside these
borders it's it's behind by his lines

46
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,489
the second thing is we see the amount of
kids who are doing signs the amount of

47
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:42,380
it is really dropping at the moment and
we did a little bit research on my n one

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,579
of the main courses about this and don't
get me wrong on this but we do have a

49
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,200
lot of female teacher in primary schools
and these are very good and have very

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,540
good communication skills but usually
the dads and the men are usually more

51
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,250
into soldiering and breaking things and
and and and fixing your bikes for

52
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,090
example

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,989
it's not about all the women I want to
say but i would just want to say that we

54
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,209
do see a trend over there

55
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:11,750
so this gets actually two problems

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,180
first of all there is not enough cyber
hygiene in the in the classroom

57
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,209
kids are not going to beat each what's
good and what's wrong

58
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,290
and second to that is where were these
junior hackers are not activated enough

59
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,720
and its activation is needed

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,880
so this is the reason why we started
this journey so one of our missions is

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,190
to bring cyber hygiene to schools

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,540
you know i'm talking about using good
passwords I'm talking about not putting

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,669
everything on facebook you you don't
want to share in the future or and even

64
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,690
about thinking about what you think what
is security and think about do I want to

65
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,080
share this is this secure yes or not
this is not the real thing about

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,400
bringing hackers to classes but it is an
important subject and we also want to

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,210
cover this

68
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,370
so by teaching the teachers at least
with cyber hygiene is and so the kids

69
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,300
can learn it they can at least teach
others and even the parents what cyber

70
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,110
genius

71
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,039
what do I make a little bit clearer what
cyber hygiene is my way ok if you've got

72
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,229
questions just just breaking please

73
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,200
our second mission is to bring more
hacking tool kits and activate is in in

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,580
in these little brains

75
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,400
we are searching for those those boys
and girls who are exploring the world in

76
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,630
a different way

77
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,990
sometimes they're even one in a
classroom and they don't know how to

78
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,979
handle their selves and even after
teacher doesn't know how to handle them

79
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,349
there usually are are one of the the the
boys or girls who are difficult and we

80
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,140
don't know how to handle it and
sometimes they even go to different

81
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,719
schools for special kids

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,860
well I also think they're special but i
think there were full special instead of

83
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,950
you have to handle them with with
different hands or something like that

84
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,710
so if we take these two missions cyber
hygiene and go and and and our mission

85
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,560
is to bring more hacking to classrooms
we we defined a few goals and as I said

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,360
we are still in alpha phase and going to
a better face soon and it is better face

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,760
we're going to bring we going to outcome
a little more to to the world in the

88
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,800
alpha phase we are learning a lot of
these kits when the first time I went to

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,080
the classroom and I show these kids how
you have to Howard it's possible to

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,400
break the system and I saw the smiles
and if it are as possible and I

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,690
understand why I can this be scared kids
were really getting and lighted by the

92
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,280
fact that somebody was over sending in
front of the classrooms and and giving

93
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,690
them a lot of energy

94
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,610
i think the the first Clause we
reschedule about one and a half hour and

95
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,389
after three o'clock we had a story after
three hours really it really had to stop

96
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,500
them because i have to go home and they
also because they were they were going

97
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,240
home late but you were so much it would
they gave so much energy on this and

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,830
I've learned one thing about this

99
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,099
this is really important for me and I
want to do this I want to see those

100
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:09,650
smiles on those faces and having to feel
about uh the the energy growing in

101
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,270
themselves and see more future instead
of only having the feeling okay i'm

102
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,120
special and they don't know how to
handle me

103
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:26,120
ok also thing is we are doing and yes we
can make a lot of plans and and do

104
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,250
everything through through a project
system or whatever but do I have has

105
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,090
been a lot of initiatives already in the
Netherlands who are not making it this

106
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,469
way if we want to change the school
system it takes about 40 of six years to

107
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,009
change the school system and bring new
information and technology

108
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:49,039
- - to school of course there are more
initiatives and we also want to want to

109
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,690
bring these initiatives

110
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,900
- - to hack in the claws we want to work
together

111
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,370
you know i'm not saying we gotta we know
everything but I at least want to say

112
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,389
that we need to create a certain point
where all these schools and all these

113
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,080
teachers and all these kids can come to
and and learn from each other and share

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,430
it all this information

115
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,029
there's the community started balls are
coming

116
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,690
I would like to work together with a lot
of people and bring these initiatives to

117
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,060
do it with more people to these kids and
you know i'm working a lot of hardware

118
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,330
but maybe somebody else is really good
in fighting and can teach python schools

119
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,680
for example third thing is we need to
start of communication and this is where

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,539
where the goal is for me at the moment
we are starting up communication and

121
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,620
also going out reach the world and see
how who's interested to join hack in the

122
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,529
claws and see if we can can make this
pilot into really something else I want

123
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,970
to grow this community because I know a
lot of moms and dads who are hacker also

124
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,250
want to help out and bring this to kids

125
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,990
ok that this was the alpha phase and now
we're going to be bad at beta program

126
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,019
and is beta program is going to be a
little bit more outreach already

127
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,069
and we want to create the tools and
resources for schools to use it could be

128
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:06,809
it should be very nice if we can think
about creating tools and and or maybe

129
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:12,509
hardware which can be used by other
teachers for example and weak I'm sure

130
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,179
that we can make this information

131
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:19,619
easy enough so teacher can handle it in
the basics you know the teacher doesn't

132
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:25,019
need to be a guru on raspberry PI's for
example now but if I you know if he or

133
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,319
she knows how to bring this very Park
raspberry pi so the kids

134
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,679
these kids are going to be enabled at
least on these technology

135
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,399
if we bring arduino do them you know
maybe maybe they can start up to do

136
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,209
blink

137
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,359
but if they're if they wanna run a
program that shield is something

138
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,970
different and there is is is that's the
reason why I'm calling it resources not

139
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,269
only want to bring tools and and
standard ways i also want to bring

140
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,350
hackers to these classrooms and so if
hackers coming in these classrooms and

141
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,799
he gets already were playing around with
arduino in this case hackers can at

142
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,350
least say hey yeah but if you can also
try this

143
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,339
so I want to extend these classrooms
with external actors for example and

144
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,889
when I'm talking about hackers by the
way i'm talking about the good guys but

145
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:10,290
you probably know that the cyber hygiene
and hacker classes is is also one of the

146
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,769
things we want to put on but cyber
hygiene needs a different approach

147
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,910
because it's also approaching the other
kids and the other kids they may be are

148
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,019
not interested in hacking at all working
computers but it's still an important

149
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,309
thing and this is more we need to change
the curriculum of the dutch school

150
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,149
system with and this is going to take a
lot of more time but if we are not going

151
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,990
to show the people that it's possible to
bring it to the kits that we don't have

152
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,959
a sample to bring it to change the
school system in the Netherlands

153
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,109
so this can take some time and it's the
reason why I'm going back to my second

154
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,160
point again over there

155
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,160
we just have to do and talk to the
schools and bring it over there

156
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,079
the third thing teach the teacher we
already spoke to about a little about is

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,270
and teaching the teacher is about

158
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,560
it's all about you guys know the
Raspberry Pi academy for example for

159
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,969
those who doesn't Raspberry Pi Academy
is enabling teachers to play around with

160
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,960
his red berry pies

161
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,890
they're bringing the basic recipe for
information in the UK to these teachers

162
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,449
and his teachers are at least able to to
play around a little bit with it and i

163
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,680
think this is also a way to go in the
Netherlands but I as i said i want to

164
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,479
have these hacker extensions to to have
the kids who want to go further

165
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,710
at least you have the possibilities also
i want to share and improve i'm really

166
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,070
into open source of these kind of things
you know I don't have all the knowledge

167
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,300
and I think if we can make this open
sores people can at least improve it

168
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,219
use it and reuse it and create a Dutch
school curriculum

169
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,360
all I put it on the loss because i think
it's most important we just start doing

170
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,560
with each other but we still have to
handle a lot of formal stuff

171
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,599
okay where are we what we're currently
in the pilot face and I just took this

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,980
picture just for fun

173
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,540
because this is also a pilot that we
want to be a hat and we started already

174
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,140
with a school in him stadium and these
are this is just a small part of the

175
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,420
classroom who started working on
unpacking in the class who was that hack

176
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,040
in the box yesterday

177
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,569
ok i will spoil some kids walking around
and playing around and pulling

178
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:22,860
yeah we we also brought the kids to to
hack in the box and to show them how big

179
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,740
this world actually can be and how fun
it can be

180
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,940
they play around a little bit with
Arduino is on the hacker spaces

181
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,100
some of them went lock-picking and i
think one even state until seven o'clock

182
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,270
in the evening

183
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,319
of course we found his dad or mom to be
sure they was allowed over there

184
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,930
so which is coming me a little bit to a
timeline and and you know we are

185
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,780
focusing on on a longer timeline as i
said this alpha phase is 4 2016 to the

186
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,270
way to go and learn how we have to
handle this even further

187
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:01,480
in 2017 we on to roll out its beta phase
and at least be on at least 10 or 20

188
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,200
schools in the Netherlands with this
program and we need a lot of people for

189
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,490
that is so if you're a hacker or at
least technically oriented and you want

190
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,580
to go to schools with his knowledge and
and want to teach kids please let me

191
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:20,050
know because we need people 2017 2018 I
put it on the curriculum mainly because

192
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,490
we need to put a goal and I don't want
to have this six-year-old six years a

193
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,670
time off of changing the curriculum

194
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,930
I want to be positive but i'm not sure
if you're going to make it in 2017 2018

195
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,880
if we're going to start over there

196
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,220
I'm a really happy guy but we can start
teach the teacher teach the teacher is

197
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,960
is we already spoke spoke to a teacher
who was not that technical but X we

198
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,820
explain some things is it ok but I'm
able to tell this to two kids and I can

199
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,090
help this gets you to work on around
these types of things

200
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,350
so our teaching a teacher is something
we should focus quite fast on because if

201
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,910
we are able to teach these teachers we
can we can go more abroad during our

202
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,230
journey we also came through the
question what is good and what is wrong

203
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,100
and this is a difficult part maybe
because we have what

204
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,600
what's good on an ethical doesn't need
necessary to be good for a kid you know

205
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,170
main goals we don't want to hurt kit we
just want to give them more

206
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,240
opportunities and enable them

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,480
so um but by at least by discussing this

208
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,560
they are getting more rich they are
understanding

209
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,380
so I have to ask myself the question is
this good as his rider is wrong and

210
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,810
what's the good way but we also do
understand that you can't give the full

211
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,880
responsibility about ethics and these
kind of things two kids and this one of

212
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,600
the reasons why I was hacking a clause
to get over here oh we want to take the

213
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,810
responsibility and help these kids at
least discussing this

214
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,719
so one of the things we we we we just
started is to junior hacker hotline and

215
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,040
if these kids have just asked questions
yeah just dialed his number and they got

216
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,110
a they got me or hero on the other side
and they are able to at least talk about

217
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,380
the issue they have for something like
that you know it's mentioned as a hard

218
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,170
line so i hope they're not going to call
me in the middle of the night

219
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,290
but on the other side if they were going
to call me in the middle of the night

220
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,439
before they are going to because
convince a crime or something like that

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm really glad to pick up the phone
maybe with my sleep he had a little bit

222
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,740
you know we want to be there for those
those kids

223
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:35,790
so yeah - come a little bit more - D -
the final stuff where we are now and

224
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,019
what we're going to do first we want to
continue our lessons you know if we

225
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:41,040
don't continue this

226
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,969
we're not learning and at least we're
not keeping the ideal life for the

227
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,709
moment we we we already broke some alarm
systems for example and show how radio

228
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,119
communication is working

229
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,290
we also want to go play around with
microcontrollers and let's show them how

230
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,360
easy it is to program these some of them
already played with arduino so we might

231
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,620
bring in some other stuff around that
maybe even bring some 3d printing in and

232
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,690
bring it to bring technology to these
kids

233
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:12,209
also one of the things we we want to do
is we are going to open a call for

234
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:17,310
volunteers and bring more volunteers to
pack in a class and see here we can

235
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,689
start of this community and and bring
more more people and get more

236
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,130
fully involved with this wood with the
project and for this we also need to

237
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,660
build some communication

238
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,280
so yeah accurately we have a placeholder
page on hacking a clause don't know

239
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,300
you know it needs to be filled and I
thinking about at least starting a wiki

240
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
so everybody can can change and enable
and started

241
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,730
also we we need to enable communication
of course in the form of twitter which

242
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,210
is going to happen actually today
because this is the first moment we're

243
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:55,770
going to outreach the outer world then
we also want to build a content and and

244
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,329
and charities content

245
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,630
you know the content i'm building i'm
going to share it anyway everybody can

246
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:06,209
use it and wants to use it but I hope we
got a lot of more people wants to wants

247
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:12,270
to join the initiatives and also want to
build content and share it and of course

248
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,129
we're going to share this information on
a CC license and you know the only thing

249
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,170
is why I'm not making a commercial is
because I think maybe a lot of hire

250
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,230
people they also want to use the
information in the boardroom and you

251
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,650
know which is fine for me but if they're
going to sell it you know i think it's

252
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,800
fine but I need to contribute a little
bit on hack in the class at least

253
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,890
so I'm coming to the end of my
presentation and the opening of hacking

254
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,250
class we did organize something which is
not in yet but we can at least at least

255
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,560
check because i want to thank you for
for listening and I hope you have some

256
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,720
questions and then and maybe you're
interested to come over and so we can we

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,690
can really launched a clause in the in
the right way so Cooper is a somebody

258
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,310
out there with something or not

259
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:08,520
ok they can come in to open hack in the
class I thought about affect you you we

260
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,820
should have a formal opening and we can
do this of course with champagne

261
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,250
what we are back in the class

262
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,820
and we are working with kids so I
thought about the fact well we should do

263
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:28,870
this at least with kids champagne so I
got alcohol free champagne and that the

264
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,850
bear will be available later

265
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:39,610
so I'm i see a lot of faces looking at
me and if you have any questions please

266
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,399
come over please show your hand and we
will the desert in the back

267
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:15,790
I i totally agree on you are on kick
starting in a way and work together

268
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,420
because there are already a lot of
programs and i want to i just want to be

269
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,720
the one to support all these programs

270
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,960
and also let me take one things

271
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,530
yep yeah

272
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:41,490
so let me repeat hero what we already
started and a half of a local agent

273
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,140
named state and and this is our pilots
or alpha class at the moment but we

274
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,740
already have two other schools who just
want to want to start with it so yeah it

275
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,060
does that answer your question

276
00:19:51,060 --> 00:20:19,980
thanks for the lady in the front over
here and I'm definitely sure we will be

277
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,240
in touch and we also i work with your
internet the only one of those who curse

278
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,720
for example in and I'm a sport is also
one of them that there are more

279
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,040
initiatives but the problem I have is a
for the moment i do see a lot of

280
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,830
initiatives but there is no central role
yet and i think when we are if we were

281
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,350
able to create just sharing platform and
extend all these CDs these possibilities

282
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,620
together then at least a ladder is a way
to go

283
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,600
the second thing you spoke about your
female teacher yourself and i'm not

284
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,600
talking about all female teachers so I
hope

285
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:02,370
yeah I I was not meant to be offensive
but i just wanted to be clear on the

286
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,889
fact that we are losing bad ass and it
it's not pointing out to somebody bad or

287
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,120
something pretty good we just want to
change the system in a good way so and

288
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,280
so well for the moment we are not aiming
on primary or secondary school mainly

289
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,170
because we do see a lot of difference on
ages on the inner battle claws

290
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,460
we got a girl in their ages it's 10
years old she's already on the secondary

291
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,540
school but she's good enough to at least
play around already with these kind of

292
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,290
things

293
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,200
so I think you're ready when you're
ready and if primary school also want to

294
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,720
start already with it that i would be
happy

295
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,500
mainly because if we can bring all these
these information already two younger

296
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,800
kids they can already start growing from
a young age yet

297
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,930
yep yeah it's a secondary schools is
first I do have to say because it's also

298
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,070
about us learning

299
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,590
you know I is seriously don't know a lot
about how to teach for example and that

300
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:12,770
there's where there is where my learning
curve starts actually so so I

301
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,370
think we we do we're going to have to
make the toast at least on a cloth to

302
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,699
thank you all for listening and I hope
you're all going to support initiative

303
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,700
so cheers on a clause

304
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:30,470
not bad thank you very much thank you
all
