1
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,020
what's about

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,550
speakers it is

3
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,310
developer to offer dynamic analysis of
android applications by applying hooks

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,599
of the Android API this package will
help you to understand the water on the

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,079
application is doing at some time and
the audience is not only security his

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:46,809
socialist or contentious but developer
status on rides if you install one happy

7
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:54,159
and the you can and you can need know
about more design app you can use this

8
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:02,350
package and the low-k what the app is
doing in what wrong time

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,289
ok my name is Antonio College Matins

10
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:20,800
I'm from sav as you and you know in
Brazil we speak part of it is so I'm

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,560
sorry I him my for my mistakes

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:32,049
ok and I up secret concerted at Temple
Security Intelligence the biggest

13
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,500
company of security in Brazil

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:43,270
i'm a member of farmer yourself inside
the tempest is a group of researchers

15
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:53,289
and let's start our agenda is very short

16
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:00,399
I'll talk a little about mobile testing
methodology about black box analysis and

17
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,259
the inspector g and do our demo
demonstration

18
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:13,420
ok then my bio testing methodology we
can divide a simple way

19
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,230
three phase information battery

20
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,769
what the network's protocols her news
app this is the application perform

21
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,890
perform commercial transactions

22
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:36,250
what different York our use and the
another questions we have the face of

23
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,380
static analysis

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,530
so if you have the source

25
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,890
you can do this analogy field but not
have the the sauce

26
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:56,410
you need to compile the application and
the local for birds for hard-coded

27
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,079
informations and the dynamic analysis

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,590
you need to monitor the messages log by
log by the apps android is specifically

29
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:21,850
sometimes the lock get help and you need
to observe the process communication

30
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:30,100
between the target application in the
other applications and the components

31
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:38,170
and you need the cash and the burger
like a gb to step through the crisis

32
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,160
situation

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,700
ok

34
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,940
yeah like about analysis yet i'm
frustrated

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:58,989
we most the answers for example how the
app works without the source code how it

36
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,540
interacted with the others components

37
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,560
ok and ready we have actives we have
providers and we need know how these

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:17,048
this interaction is and if you are doing
one on

39
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:23,378
analogy you we have no what

40
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:30,129
what are the security issues about this
app and this package you can happiest

41
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,530
with this

42
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,568
okay but how it works

43
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:50,379
this package the simple application and
ride with I the Naga HTTP server so we

44
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:59,440
have our friendly web interface in the
provided one web interface and its

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,710
development as on xposed framework model

46
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:15,520
ok but you can roam it without exposing
so many functionalities is not real not

47
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:26,889
work without the explicit but you can
use Spanish have many features and

48
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:36,159
desires the groups of features and then
we have information gathering actions we

49
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,759
can

50
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:44,830
tirage with the that we can call active
first for example we could take

51
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,919
screenshot download files

52
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,759
this package has some pride the final
hooks

53
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,009
ok and then the Tab A plus hurt

54
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:10,990
we can add new hooks at runtime and the
last is one is is what I be locked getty

55
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,840
on for the show the information is
collected by the locket and showing

56
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,229
showing the

57
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,170
inspector ok now the demonstration

58
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,600
okay here we have the package

59
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,130
when we start this package

60
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:58,130
the website is started so we can now
access the web interface the browser if

61
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,800
you are in the same it if in the same
network

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:13,580
the notebook and the cell phone you can
access through this your hair or if you

63
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,990
plug the USB USB you can access through
the adb forward option

64
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:40,479
and of course you can change the depart
the set apart and for this demonstration

65
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,380
I develop one app called keep acts

66
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,380
it's a password manager

67
00:07:50,290 --> 00:08:10,540
ok and now in the package e we can
choose the target the key packs now

68
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:21,610
where we are we making a fresh in the
browser and some information pops up

69
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,610
gauged

70
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,799
one minute

71
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
ok

72
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,560
and in this area we have some formations
about the gap

73
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,250
so we have the passion

74
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,969
yd and the package name

75
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,930
the components of the depth we have the
exported activities knock spotted this

76
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:28,019
out these informations you don't need
hope the app so if you install the

77
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,990
inspectors we can we can obtain
attenders information without the

78
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,990
explosion

79
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,310
but the application is not run yet

80
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
ok

81
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,510
now that launch the that and he first
the browser

82
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:14,670
the app is running and the hooks are
applying for

83
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:25,560
we can download that through this
package we can download to the files

84
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,560
generated by the inspected the logs

85
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,250
we can take a screenshot

86
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,110
yeah

87
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
ok

88
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,939
yeah

89
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:14,299
we can see the files in the data folder
of the application you can navigate and

90
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:22,189
we can show download this fires

91
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:44,920
we have a settings option that we can
finish the app start yep and his start

92
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:52,449
yep in some cases we need to start the
app for 24 apply new hooks

93
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,709
ok

94
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,700
and we have read the final brother final
tabs

95
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,910
ok brother finally hooks trade
preference civilization

96
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,780
crypto has collide it be

97
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:29,980
precision many information is collected
some miscellaneous webview tipsy and

98
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,660
plus hooks this last tab we can add the
new hooks

99
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:54,389
when its young know the class the the
package in the class and the method we

100
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:00,540
need to hook and there on time this
hooks that are applied

101
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,779
and

102
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:19,239
if you don't specify the the methods all
the methods of the this class are who

103
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,670
can and you can show

104
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:29,498
check this these BOTS and hope the
Constructors ok

105
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,840
yeah

106
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,220
ok

107
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:52,629
back to the our appt the keep bags and
let's try login

108
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,370
so

109
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:25,330
how are you as a not exist and here we
have the carry it by the applicant happy

110
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:33,550
and the we can see the passwords is a
fresh format and then that I be hash

111
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,880
we can see that the password

112
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,300
and this Carrie it's not a not a hazard

113
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,300
but of all the hazards

114
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:06,579
now let's has that is user and in this
package we have more information

115
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,189
now they reset the hash again

116
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,730
and if you if we tried logging again

117
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,650
the informations are color collected and
here we have the idea of the new user

118
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,680
here in the shed preference tab we have
one another

119
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:06,410
put with information active user for ok
we can see to the fire

120
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
sherrod presence the file formats

121
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:24,880
and now let's add new int hopes black
screen black screen is not a bug

122
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:34,270
wow it's a protection colored flag
secure and and through this package we

123
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,050
can bypass this flag secure

124
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:50,829
ok in the settings options we have this
option is disabled for security

125
00:16:51,580 --> 00:17:01,900
now we can access the new enter and this
is screen and activities show it

126
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,180
this product actions is for the screen
capture

127
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,180
ok

128
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,740
ok

129
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,750
yeah

130
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:42,310
ok when we add em and your password in
the password manager in the tabby sharp

131
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,090
reference

132
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:53,679
we have one get for the s key and the
hazards of this get for the short

133
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,990
preference and interesting the time that
I be ripped off

134
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,990
we have formation

135
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,639
yeah

136
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:26,820
here we have the secret case pack method
and the of the informations collected

137
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:38,040
decipher the password in . test and the
permission encrypted in the scale light

138
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:47,159
we have a new is set now in the table
key with the facebook and the password

139
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,360
encrypted and the user number four

140
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,930
ok

141
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:20,629
in the options show out password the
password is show it

142
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:27,380
the facebook password encrypted and ask
a lighted we have a new query

143
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,490
and look in the plus hook

144
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,970
we have the information about the hour

145
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,129
getstring Geisha is a path for a backup
file

146
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,850
the file system tab we can see this that
this fire is using

147
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,800
and in that we have touched to copy it
takes past 12 clipboard

148
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:30,080
then when ok and other informations and
clip the type of collagen and the

149
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:45,740
information Krypton and the information
. text the inverse of this imbecile

150
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,460
manuals

151
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:56,030
we we have a look at the clipboard
function so the clipboard string is is

152
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,928
show it there ok

153
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:18,399
ok now I I to the log in with another
user with more information

154
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,440
the user number 1 and in this step we
have this option is colored care provide

155
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,390
that we can hit Reformation about it

156
00:21:46,390 --> 00:22:02,470
the providers use it by the sqlite for
example the provider users and we can

157
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,470
three

158
