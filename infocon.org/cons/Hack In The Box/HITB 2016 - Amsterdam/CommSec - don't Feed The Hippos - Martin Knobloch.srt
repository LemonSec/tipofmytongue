1
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,240
the top

2
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,250
we went java programming and I see that
a lot of times people do

3
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,110
hacking and security guys think they're
super smart I've been I back then taught

4
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,700
myself plc programming wasn't able to
find a weak spot in a complex system

5
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
how hard is it to heck and how easy is
it

6
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,530
how hard is it to protect this is my
talk about

7
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm like for some soy four years ago I
had a timeout

8
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,710
I put my wife two weeks of vacation and
she finally called them and i took

9
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,178
motorbike up to North carp and the good
thing is then you're not connected to

10
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:48,799
our spot AF note is a connection no
cellphone connection nothing

11
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,810
so I was in this void and enjoy a nice
view of Norway and on the water by in

12
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,909
the corners it's a really great time and
come back two weeks later and guess what

13
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,709
nothing changed not too good every
screen problem solved not too bad not

14
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:09,229
diverted and stopped existing so I think
what what is different what is how can

15
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,310
we achieve something happens existing
seventies but what is a problem and how

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,600
can we achieve it to make it really
better about breaking it but it talks

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,570
actually about thinking out of the box

18
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,130
I know several years ago was it like big
hype out-of-the-box thinking I got to

19
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,540
hear about this anymore

20
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,350
what's actually good because there is no
out of the box and get the box this

21
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,970
context is what you are

22
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,049
it's your back to our language is that
what you experience your education

23
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,410
everything your ex received as knowledge
in the past and you cannot look at

24
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,590
something else and from outside your own
box

25
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,880
so apparently we look from our box to
other boxes we should apparently SVP of

26
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,660
people

27
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,900
we're sticking our box is our safety our
comfort zones our knowledge

28
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,319
so we look at other boxes they are hey
this is wrong

29
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,799
do we understand the other box that's
how when I come office is it actually

30
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,790
was straight up by and the store and
this is top TEDx talk

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:18,380
he was 8 24 8 programs in Africa and
this great story on this hilarious me

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,460
explaining

33
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:25,640
how he's a young guy in the seventies
from Italy coast of Africa Zimbabwe and

34
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,600
as a program

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,829
so he says I'm Italian I'm good in
growing vegetables and there's a foot

36
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,670
problem in Africa

37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,720
so he explains how he goes there and
that's across this river delta

38
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,869
it's really for to fall out of the
ground so Italian school vegetables and

39
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,620
he is not saying unity in Italy equal
tomatoes and it is stare like that

40
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,830
so the a programmer's put in money and
grow vegetables so everybody was happy

41
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,590
for a program side with but guess what
happened

42
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,710
the vegetables were ready to be eaten
and suddenly a lot of his appears and

43
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,090
ate all those vegetables

44
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,950
relax shop the cloud where people
respect to come from why have you told

45
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,280
us and a lot of said he don't ask

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,700
and isn't that the same way we're
security community engaged to developers

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,170
we say all your problems your car is not
secure

48
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:26,630
that's a big problem but do we
understand what their problem really is

49
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,550
and do we help them in the most positive
most best way now because we come with

50
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,930
PDF reports become with you sure to
death but it's only one of that

51
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,860
conserves most developers are not talk
about security

52
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,310
anyway we look in the curriculums our
universities we are security you get

53
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,850
network security and pick up every
secret development

54
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,010
now what do we do seu to people we make
a more complex so we add a lot of stuff

55
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,280
that actually developed does not care
about threat modeling abuse cases is the

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:09,799
right way so I see this hippos as
something you can race resources it time

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,240
and money resource race it for the
mystical security hippos

58
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,860
so let's talk about what you should not
to some security is actually that

59
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,520
security has been named it's our fault
security community

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,859
it is a lot of things wrong first all
security is very serious

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,000
you can a lot of our security it's very
high priority but it's kind of shocking

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,830
wolf too many times so see this on the
news that this Bank as heck next thing

63
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,400
you say

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,810
people don't care about because that's
not a story short he moves too many

65
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,819
times where porn

66
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,569
we say security is expensive

67
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,960
that's kind of the the business card
side of so when you want to have

68
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,068
security you need is very expensive
security guidelines we have 17 security

69
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:07,039
consultant outside lights will make
money with and most of all securities

70
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,849
complex

71
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:13,819
so when you understand the world of
developer who is managing development

72
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:14,509
projects

73
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,810
it's a project manager and what is the
business of project manager what is his

74
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,840
concerns to be on time and in budget so
as a brother in it does not want

75
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,669
anything this complex or expensive so it
makes like they don't have security

76
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,068
because we tell them it's very complex
and is expensive and we wonder why did

77
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,539
on what does because we had like on the
place a think at least want

78
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:48,050
so that's a mess we should take care of
you should actually remove the security

79
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,279
stem make more visible the things you
should do

80
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,229
don't be the main security I this is
basically a business security always

81
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,120
here is like Ministry of no security is
this abling functionality

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,800
it's not allowing to report to
production it's not it's not so what a

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,860
experience is whatever I want my
gorgeous

84
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,039
the security guys taking shape no it's
not helping

85
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,810
we should tell them security is enabling
not for bidding

86
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,330
yes we want to enable secure
communications in communications and

87
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,400
they make it responds by make it secure

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,318
yes we want to have online business and
security makes it responsible way to

89
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:30,889
make

90
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,699
yes we are helping them enabling them
this is nice

91
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,469
an adult from Henry Ford when they asked
him why does the car have brakes

92
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:42,469
what do you think where does the car
have brakes

93
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,469
it was not a rhetorical question no
answers ok

94
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,400
most people think because they want to
break want to stop it will be the

95
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,888
minister of noted disabling effect and
an adult would actually not true says no

96
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,219
the car has breaks the response will be
able to try faster

97
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:06,180
so this is a different way to think
about functionality and security but so

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,400
this one is don't hide it so many times
the security officer is either hidden

99
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,349
far away or a security expert but i do
they come in the door security test and

100
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,180
we are they ready for home brewing from
remote system and are in a different

101
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,909
ring or room 10 different team

102
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,349
so this is the guys impact coming in
super cool sunglasses go in the room

103
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:31,259
making the black magic and deliver a PDF
report

104
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:36,539
no visibility no engagement at the
height so we have to be out of to

105
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,299
facebook security people should be able
to find you

106
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,098
everybody at it's very hard so he'll be
among the people who you want to teach

107
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,240
be available very part 1

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
a lot of people miss I talked to a
customer's a CO and is all about

109
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,099
security development that I want to talk
to the project managers to business

110
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,820
the chat function tests developer
finally tested often forget to education

111
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,589
because it's a security source

112
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:06,690
it's negated and I said all people want
to engage to improve security

113
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,490
he was like side so what this is a great
thing about our job will take the stuff

114
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,750
and we have to talk to people but
apparently we in technical people we are

115
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,130
not good at talking

116
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,439
let's be a bit form so we have to learn
to talk and be interested about what we

117
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,480
do meet others understand their problem

118
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,050
I went to a customer talk so engagement
when actually the business and take the

119
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,000
people in the same meeting room

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,660
what my first noticed they were
introducing each other to each other

121
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,339
like your colleagues you understand
floors that yes person the other ring

122
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,570
that's to tech guys that developers and
we are the business that's the first

123
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,840
time they met the meeting maybe I report
may result despite bit of late isn't it

124
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,320
that's very normal people always look
for the comfort zone

125
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,670
we never started working in my previous
company and all the technologies and the

126
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,180
unit we're not by technology but by
reaching out to come from

127
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,470
so I was new guy , dependable so I went
around the table

128
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,910
oh who are you out we have java
developers all of you

129
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,819
yes to make the next table for you guys
we had organ systems is awkward

130
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,060
next year what the couple people so all
we went to college together in that

131
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,930
professional t they look at me like he
should be over there that's trouble

132
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,479
so you but we are colleagues we were
together sometime people have a fear to

133
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,650
engage you

134
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,420
that's a pity because then you can learn
what is the advantage of other languages

135
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,459
for example a lot of people laugh about
cold war isn't it like every dying

136
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,020
no comments really good things because
Kabul developed by default

137
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm very high quality and coding I agree

138
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,280
laughs about it Square and check
yourself but you won't find an SQL

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,300
injection from all fashion global
development why precompiler queries

140
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,069
that's how to do it , little squares

141
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,790
it's the normal way to do it is not
security it's the way how do you address

142
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,650
the database scripts in for the
opportunity to learn from it

143
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,300
pay attention this relation to them
listen about the program

144
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,910
look around and developer has so many
things to think about

145
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:29,160
most of our yeah to leave a software as
fast as possible so engage understand

146
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,189
she'll be dead in the past extra make
employers should sponsor my smoking

147
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,250
because when you have a meeting and the
manager is there no word about what's

148
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:41,850
going on

149
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,290
isn't it we met our manager we not talk
to the other people about our problems

150
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,860
when you go outside for a small what's
actually last year's getting harder and

151
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,070
harder to find other smokers then you
hear everything

152
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,440
so actually you should pay me for
smoking popular smoke or trick bring

153
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,150
this over to it and list them not only
sending about better things

154
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,069
listening what their programs

155
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,970
promise of those considerations
understanding their context

156
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,689
it's a very important one because we
come see people a a PDF report

157
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,569
it's a race of time and tissue paper
because the PDF report you can do

158
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,490
nothing it doesn't help that is
available

159
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,720
that's just another report let's file
okay it's got you would never

160
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,950
dynamic great to share the knowledge
what have you found

161
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,420
why did they find it when it gets to
application but you before i do

162
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,110
securities

163
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,150
I always engage with the team and many
times in the Dakota fewer penetration

164
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,720
test

165
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,380
I almost had nothing to do because of
the first we talked to the team

166
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,220
they know about the problem when you're
not like this

167
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,770
angee external core bashing security guy
and you say hey I want to be able to

168
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,420
tell me about the project

169
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,770
you hear about the problems and I can be
the external ever to help improve the

170
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,850
code because they know the problems and
you are delivered to make it possible

171
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,630
because you are external them you know
more like in turn people always like are

172
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,250
the barbri external over his external
security I after what he's saying

173
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,230
so you can help them improve security if
Brent and help them to solve their

174
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,780
problems supporter

175
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,490
first thing is a different one needs to
be appreciated

176
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,840
i was developing but you always you you
are too expensive

177
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,829
nobody's like oh you're probably I want
to pay you more

178
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:45,130
you're too expensive or too late too
slow and we're going to outsource you

179
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,760
anyway

180
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,650
that makes it really feel appreciated
isn't it so I Met Your different about

181
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,550
you doing your best you care about your
code and then you get that we might also

182
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,400
see anyway that's not very good

183
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,730
whatever chop you do if we appreciate
you all

184
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:06,130
if your window cleaner a truck developer
or toy lady appreciation for your work

185
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,660
caring for your program is very
important but somehow a lot of companies

186
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,160
think software it's expensive and we
don't really need it like all IT

187
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,699
I don't understand why banks insurance
is don understand they're actually

188
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,230
software development companies was a
banking insurance licenses because

189
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:30,040
remove the IT for a bank of those left
the license or functionality so you have

190
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,449
to understand the development

191
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:37,030
I t is not the cost sector it's enabling
its keeps you in business and also the

192
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,319
people wrote there you have to enable
and appreciate her so i'll talk i have

193
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,340
it's what I appreciate develop a hundred
available be friends isn't appreciated

194
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,290
very important

195
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:56,260
a lot of people failing this because we
don't understand the context and it's

196
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,540
like funny videos in the past but you
looked around

197
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,870
you almost could tell who is an cover
program of course the support people

198
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,000
with big glasses and the check shirts

199
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,310
pence in there isn't it the don't let
their mobile apps developed these days

200
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,680
the young slim young developers sir

201
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,520
fleshy branch short her strange haircut
but they have a history in a feeling

202
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,990
like 13 years old

203
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,360
it'sit's ages outdated I really tell
them about the past that will help you

204
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,370
we look in the box it's very weird that
when you look in a app store

205
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,019
developers developers you find teams
like everyday chiz like just about

206
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,309
twenty20 series before and yes they
eagerly fellow

207
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:46,069
it's nice you need is people are young
driven full of tests Rome and running up

208
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,670
to the mountains but you need also
different people

209
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,660
you need to let me want to all the
people that maybe it's not that smart to

210
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,069
do that way we have to understanding of
the problems in the Pops

211
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:04,069
I know what team actually one of the
developers is about 450

212
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:08,329
it's a mobile app developer and he's
about 50 and then I get first with a

213
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,638
team are at school

214
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,079
look at him he's both 50 and he develops
mobile android apps

215
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,969
he's a Java developer for plus 16 18
years

216
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,149
right yes but its its mobile is
different

217
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:29,329
ok ok ok time to go maybe it's because
i'm getting all look like and then I

218
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,149
talk about a guy for a 70 because it was
the one smoker

219
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:37,100
he said he actually you're not you're
right because when we have an idea

220
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,279
he's the guys just taking mm and then
they start like em what you tell you

221
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,970
about what could happen from his
experience in the past

222
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:56,660
that's very funny a did an assignment in
Romania as sorry bulgaria and i found

223
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,639
that they're like more than a half of
the employees to technical self its

224
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,230
female that's very interesting site that
ass in a manager how comes

225
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,819
he said they look for people because
they do see you support and development

226
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,579
together to look for smart people taking
people who can actually talk business

227
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,039
and understand you know what they
couldn't find male suitor for a few only

228
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,720
females so actually we extend our box of
our knowledge box our background from

229
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,529
our project by adding different boxes so
a team has to be most various people in

230
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:38,210
the team and actually a security patch
will be there as well so I still see

231
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,220
that test different team and there's a
security and all the way to talk is the

232
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,890
getting with the insecurity issues like
one way they fix

233
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,330
this fix this developing so
understanding that and even how we

234
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,030
deliver report to be awkward

235
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,410
become another system PDF file to forget
about us

236
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,630
that's for management or we got a file
can file it but everything dynamic a

237
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,910
shared knowledge how you found it

238
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,110
so not only say this is wrong how
engaged to application what I found was

239
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,899
made that I called the treasure trail
how I went to find a coma for those

240
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,860
considerations why I did stuff when you
can get your application it's not just

241
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,240
wanting to all finding Reaper issues and
then report my hope so

242
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,770
when you have an application isn't it
and you have a feeling like this is with

243
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,170
our quality message sent power meters
here

244
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,430
write it down write ups its report we do
a security test

245
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:41,800
sharing knowledge have a meeting I don't
training and I tell people about how to

246
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,190
share reports and there are you get us
including zip file right

247
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,400
ok do this Security's talk to you

248
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,650
sometimes to see them like walking by
their magic room but they're not

249
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,360
engaging as it

250
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,669
you should ask word and I will not do a
security problem is not telling the team

251
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,950
or asking for be able to tell the team

252
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,110
what did how did and why did it and go
through the issues of the farm and he

253
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,010
said yes

254
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,520
a playbook stairs to the cost of
approximately eight six thousand euros

255
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,340
and if we want to have this report
discussed

256
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,169
it's 1,000 years extra actually should
like to make the security guy and said

257
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,500
well because even though can't explain
it

258
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,880
you fail so don't upset people say but
when you want to engage we want to

259
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,900
listen them

260
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,420
you should have set up of course but
that is what security people do I got

261
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,050
fed up because when another security
conference another guy talking about how

262
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,980
stupid developers are breaking about his
own to lee road is that you can download

263
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,160
it for free and get her butt don't look
at the source code because i can't a

264
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,970
fellow

265
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,250
so we playin people they don't revert
probably we don't understand what kind

266
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,360
of do it ourselves

267
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,209
so it's making the face and ask you to
listen

268
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,679
it's not the most ideal way to engage
with other people

269
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:14,690
shut up and listen that's actually the
end quote of NSS talked into X we try to

270
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,220
send just be there

271
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,600
listen to bring all the fellas do know
about security

272
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,500
when they are about quality of the code
the blood sweat and tears to sleep is

273
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,270
nice about coding if you can trigger
them and appreciate them for being code

274
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,760
then the world trim vertical I was a
deal like that i went to coding but then

275
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,640
a book of course business card is good
enough

276
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,570
I went home and I have proof my code so
because i wasn't certified this

277
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,809
eagerness in delivering high quality
code is very important

278
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,710
that's what you have one to have in your
team we achieve that

279
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,130
of course there are always people the
only break to get money which should

280
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,000
blame them it's a legitimate reason to
work isn't it

281
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm happy I made a copy my job to make
it possible to make them eager for

282
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,260
quality and tell them like actually
security makes accuse them is like a

283
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,649
security again and it's all the best
thing he said about security

284
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:15,770
they stopped listening so usually go
there liste problems and another thing

285
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,330
is to deliver the report issues is
dynamically so to forget about PDF

286
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,889
report think about quality a lot of
corporate turns out and using them

287
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,149
actually go to files and then treated
correctly that is the first step to

288
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:33,860
remove the security problems using
cyclomatic complexity for we move in

289
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,740
complex code we've done this complexity

290
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,510
tell them about it and understand it
properly understand their world and

291
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,149
deliver the issues you find in their
system

292
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:49,010
not another system like executed so they
have the ide the trailer that everything

293
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,610
and then newcomer secures any more
complexity

294
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,570
you should make your work easier not
more complex and port

295
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,970
it was my talk

296
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,449
any questions

297
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:23,040
I agree with what you say fuck it i find
the biggest problem with the development

298
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,450
it's a problem because we say

299
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,590
security is expensive and complex so the
first thing that's why when customers

300
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,340
said I need to talk to business because
business once and it being element

301
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,790
security no big mystery of know so i
want to enable them for having the

302
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,970
business running and time on market so
we knew it

303
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,480
tell them you want to have this
functionality responsible

304
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,780
these are things you can do actual
development process like it increasing

305
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:03,960
the maturity of Social Development one
thing is a even that's more complex is

306
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,110
like this away how we should write
secure code

307
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,990
it's a way how do we should make SQL
queries right caramelizing queries and

308
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,190
what we now see it's like all we do
first threat modeling defend about the

309
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,950
cables that one way business doesn't
care about threat modeling

310
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,100
they don't understand that like this
that's what security people to make it

311
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,610
more able to speak their language and
understand that the business is care

312
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,979
about wanting money to say okay we can
refuse to course by training and

313
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,120
educating yeah

314
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,500
thank you

315
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,710
ok
