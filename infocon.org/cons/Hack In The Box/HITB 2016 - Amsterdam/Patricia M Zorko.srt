1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,590
well thank you very much mr. Cole for
the introduc

2
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,980
and I'm very happy to stand here at this
seventh pick in the book security

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,680
conference by now

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,689
one of the most important and
forward-looking platforms for technical

5
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,050
discussions on computer security issues

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,349
I understood there are over 400 security
professionals and researchers here today

7
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:50,829
and from all over the world and i really
want to emphasize that you are very

8
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:58,210
important community and this makes me
especially art to hold the welcome

9
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,210
address as i am probably the least

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,590
technical person in the room the same
goes for many rooms in my office and of

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,680
course we also have the technical person
is also in our office but we have both

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,740
the policymakers and the technicians and
the last six months

13
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,170
I did pick up some cyber wisdom but
still I'm learning

14
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,979
I came from the police has already
stated with its which is by region a

15
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:41,679
very physical security world that works
through columns and structures cyber is

16
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:48,700
about the opposite a digital world
without any columns and structures and

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,610
they seemed far apart when I just
started a long time ago but my finding

18
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,330
is that they are not not anymore

19
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:04,209
they are moving more and more towards
each other and the importance of your

20
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,569
work goes further than technical
knowledge

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,630
it's all also about society's interests
and protecting these

22
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,220
cyber has become mainstream and often
without noticing

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,070
we have become more and more reliant our
homes and cars are built on it

24
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,489
our businesses depend on it our nation's
infrastructure runs on it

25
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,149
sixty percent of the dutch shops online
and eighty percent uses online services

26
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,230
to do their banking pay their taxes and
organized mortgages

27
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,310
ninety-four percent of our hosts
households have a computer connected to

28
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,300
the Internet

29
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,500
one in every four up euros we learned in
the last 10 years

30
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,040
we owe to ICT and we live our lives
through our mobiles

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,079
we communicate with our friends through
whatsapp Twitter and Facebook and drones

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,260
at a new photo cameras we rent our
holidays homes through airbnb we are

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,790
taxis through y <operand> twenty
</operand> and in some places we already

34
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,519
have a digital waiter for our drinks

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,140
of course for you all these examples are
familiar and we know it makes our lives

36
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,609
easier and processes more efficient but
they also show us how dependent we have

37
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,830
become of ICT and that makes us all so
vulnerable

38
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,810
which brings me to one of the biggest
paradoxes of our time

39
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:51,959
the same technology that helps us
threatens us because not only cyber has

40
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,050
become mainstream but also has
cybercrime and cyber espionage and the

41
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,470
cyber attack is rarely limited to one
country

42
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,010
cybercriminals have no limits

43
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,820
they know no limits like the carbonate
gang cyber criminals who a year ago

44
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,909
still approximately 1 billion dollars
from hundreds of banks all over the

45
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,220
world and apart from the apparent large
economic damage

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
it also poses a threat to our society

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:36,549
and also to our security because many of
you and our critical infrastructure

48
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:48,070
railroad airports telecom energy etc etc
runs on ICT systems that often are

49
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,050
closely connected in most cases there's
not any more

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,600
an analog ultimate at alternative a
major power cut means we cannot make

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
payments

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,090
it means no more water now my transport

53
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,140
no more communications a few weeks ago I
wanted to bring my car to the garage for

54
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,080
repairs and I called to make an
appointment and mechanics answer was

55
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,219
let me first check in our computer
what's wrong with your car and how much

56
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,510
time it will take to repair it and then
i will call you back for an appointment

57
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,990
we're even a middle-class car has a
protection construction to protect

58
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,080
driver and passengers against collisions
its computer is hackable from a distance

59
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,130
and this calls for extra attention from
colleagues working on smart cars to make

60
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:56,110
sure that driverless cars don't become
careless or even dangerous drivers as

61
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,530
the Internet of Things continues to grow
with more and more connected devices

62
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:08,229
like smart cars smart meters and smart
devices also for your home security risk

63
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,859
in our society are increasing and this
leads me to what

64
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,580
in my eyes is the main challenge of our
time to balance innovation and security

65
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,740
and this is where the physical and
digital world are moving towards the

66
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,900
other if we want to make optimal use of
what the digital domain has to offer

67
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,659
we need to threaten and keep
strengthening our digital system

68
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
security

69
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,170
and a world that has arisen and thrived
on creativity and a lack of rules now

70
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:49,890
asks for a certain form of regulation in
order to stay a safe place to live our

71
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,659
lives and to do our business and at the
same time

72
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,920
cybercrime asked for our physical
security world a more with my alt police

73
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
force to get digital

74
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,520
this resulted in the netherlands in the
high-tech crime team which are now very

75
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,789
well my past and we all need to expand
their physical terrain with the digital

76
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,460
an article in a dutch newspaper the
other day showed us how much these

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:30,810
worlds are growing to watch each other
research on hackers showed that are

78
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,690
showing more and more similarities with
normal office workers among which is a

79
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,890
nine-to-five mentality but of course
that does not apply to you and please

80
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,300
don't lose it

81
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:53,040
please keep your identity the only way
to threaten our digital security is to

82
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,940
work together

83
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,960
governments companies and hacker
communities nationally and

84
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,190
internationally

85
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,890
I have learned one thing in the last six
months that cybersecurity is about

86
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,000
cooperation

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,990
it's also about participation really
working together to blend our worlds and

88
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,669
that's why I'm pleased to be here

89
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:27,060
I like to see it as a dance between
governments companies and their

90
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,250
communities and most of the critical
infrastructure is owned by private

91
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,580
companies not by the government and
cybercrime and is espionage

92
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,330
they know don't know any borders so we
really have to meet to work together

93
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,230
public-private cooperation nationally
and internationally

94
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,670
that's the core of our Dutch approach it
is the precondition for a secure future

95
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:04,719
online and offline and therefore cyber
security is one of our priorities during

96
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:13,420
our EU presidency and we are all doing
the utmost to successfully complete the

97
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,750
network and information security
directive in this directive on security

98
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:26,500
requirements and breach notification for
critical infrastructure and we also

99
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:33,250
threaten and international cooperation
to prevent or diminish digital threats

100
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,950
in computer security and it Incident
Response Teams the sea search it helps

101
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,650
us to detect and respond to cyber
incidents more effectively and this way

102
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:51,939
this directive helps us to increase
digital security in Europe two weeks ago

103
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:59,080
on a high level meeting also in
amsterdam on cyber security officials of

104
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,950
all Europe came together 40 private
organizations signed a coordinated

105
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,810
vulnerability disclosure manifesto a
letter of intent with which

106
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,790
organizations declare that they support
the principle of a hotline for IT

107
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,490
vulnerabilities and we'll set up hope

108
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:25,360
outline then Sam themselves and by
signing the participating organizations

109
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,750
endorsed importance of the efforts of
researchers and the hacker community to

110
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,300
make the internet and our society

111
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:41,439
savor the manifesto wasn't an initiative
of the rabobank one of our banks and the

112
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,630
CIO platform

113
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,590
let's and something i'm extremely proud
of other issues discussed and agreed

114
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,270
upon at a meeting where that the key
objective to boost the European cyber

115
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,530
security industry to ensure that
citizens and businesses have access to

116
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,329
the latest digital and security
technologies that that was one of the

117
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:11,790
key objectives to really work on because
this is more like a big carrot than a

118
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,140
big stick

119
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,449
because i think we don't need more
regulations then is strictly necessary

120
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,390
the most important benefit of
public-private cooperation is that we

121
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,650
are all more capable of tackling
cybersecurity issues together

122
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,699
how to do this is our common challenge

123
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,980
cyber attacks can hit is all all over
the world and they are getting better by

124
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,550
the day and that calls for reinforcing
our corporation in all the states at all

125
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,439
levels in politics and in the boardroom
from different perspectives

126
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,459
ladies and gentlemen we have been in a
cyber arms race since the beginning of

127
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,940
the internet and the good guys build new
defense systems the bad guys build new

128
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:11,640
weapons and to stop the cycle we must
employ this wisdom of the crowd but not

129
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,069
just any old crowd will do

130
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,240
now we need you we need your wisdom

131
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:27,960
we need your expertise and we needed
during this conference of course but we

132
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,550
needed also after this conference every
day after

133
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,110
and this is why i am so happy to see
that all of you are here and investing

134
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:46,070
the last two days and today and tomorrow
in technical trainings to expand your

135
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,530
wisdom and don't forget the very
important capture of the flag

136
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:58,819
competition of course as I can see some
of you might still be tired of the

137
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,900
competition needing the coffee and that
is great news because those competitions

138
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:16,189
they help us all to improve our skills
and to stay trained in a digital way and

139
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,260
i hope you will keep expressing
yourselves as ambassadors for cyber

140
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,880
security in your daily routine with the
wisdom of this conference

141
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,859
ladies and gentlemen cyber has become
mainstream and so has cybercrime

142
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,190
let's make sure the cyber security
becomes mainstream as well let's do our

143
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:46,460
bit to protect the physical and the
digital world the world we all love so

144
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,300
much

145
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I wish you all very much

146
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,120
- inspiring days physical and digital
thank you very much

147
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,830
yeah
