6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,860
sandbox the second degree heat today

7
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,089

11
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,509
her last yeah

12
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:15,400
first I we all focus on what you told us
how much you know about her

13
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,210
st. Thomas I'm thinking about that and
the same technology and next I we all

14
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:30,429
details the city center . here and at
last I i we all talked to some

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,100
exploration technologies the end up

16
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:46,720
I also prepare a use of pollution a tank
we do and the and the last time out I i

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,310
we are played

18
00:01:48,310 --> 00:02:00,909
ok let's go from beginning but then
prevent aids a opens also with an idea

19
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,250
to implant a performance and huh

20
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,269
oh aight her it was the start here by
always all I te Shan Yu service worker

21
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:17,799
and her coverage university here 10
years ago and now it has to be a virtual

22
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:23,200
productor many many cloud provider use
eat huh

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,260
sometimes I

24
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,040
AWS nino de and the robot series and the
our army and even clock

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
alibaba cloud

26
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,590
this is the simplest the same product
her

27
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:48,030
you are a moment mmm the have her weezer
the happier we store is a director and

28
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:57,269
the secrecy directly on the hardware and
her compared to pool cue em and compared

29
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,000
with Grandma adds a new cannot say how a
user is a newsstand on the line

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,989
os os cannot mmm but huh

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,599
the only how how implant here the same
power function just as he was 13 and the

32
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:24,510
memory management and the way I'm
control you know that he then it didn't

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,679
happen easter can either i use bar ranch
without her

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,639
r OS or hosted last so they host the
last is intentional

35
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,639
the Xhosa who's the last week are the
dominant 0 don't mean that dominates the

36
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:57,209
short of our Tommy . adami means that we
saw more chain so . so and that are

37
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,199
under day

38
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,019
no material other mr. took other
mistreat her to cool their control and

39
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,290
odds are a user domains and

40
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:16,149
if necessary it hold it hold up a also
has to be roughly the hardware

41
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:26,229
easy easy picture into the future too .
10 use the you know the saying special

42
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:29,530
to us than the tool ctrl answer Sarah

43
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,599
you started all means and the control of
divorce banger

44
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:45,580
based on our times throughout the series
when I when I do tell you how is our we

45
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,370
analyse cape

46
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,550
I I used to I used to the somewhat
different ways at all with that or the

47
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,430
implant gently pull on piety

48
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,430
we asked me to give oh that hand come

49
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,570
why would see do you use polarization
technology that eats a tool set her

50
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,919
every told me I i we don't you two hands
at the fall pretty easy to answer the

51
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,919
ultimate aero but her

52
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:25,419
the scenes and maybe it may be
competitive for you this week because it

53
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:32,320
because the day for a thought a user
Tommy if what if i use a dominant has a

54
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,880
a fall pro probably jesus answered 1 105
and has a missing some important huh

55
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:47,979
information starting into a tiny restore
the service is also a Poisson why not

56
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,080
able to see museum

57
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,969
I think it's her that way not a not her

58
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,190
we are we are usable we try and armies
are running different who

59
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,229
moda mostly the quoted padding in tool

60
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,729
toe taps p.m. and each we m , is up
heroin with all ideas are more chain and

61
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:19,060
it'll it'll pull around with a more
defined

62
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,630
West cannot and then the each way i'm
going to use the how do we are a seat

63
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,310
i'm here with all the ideas and other
days it's a time that you know her

64
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,820
entire exit are in her

65
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,060
the technology and that I it is a body
around with a comedy Anna Espinosa

66
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,190
sometimes a windows

67
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,480
mm that's that I did her

68
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,389
I mean our team how do you sort of have
about about that is higher ma'am ma'am

69

mmm the have a reason how is the memory
management is the mom I'll be tomorrow

72
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:14,710
compacts that because the easier it'll
continue the tour you are you support

73
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:21,940
eaten either to ensure are effectively
and he did hit you need to eat her need

74
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,780
a tool to asana ads are compact stands
for

75
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,820
hmm the day for each other for each one
would see how is our support for

76
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,530
different management memory management
and another do that

77
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:47,049
why is a shadow theatre table as a speed
here and another one

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,030
peter from Anambra ok

151
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:32,600
o our idea when I believe he's a wii
disc Laura that is a used a featured

152
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:40,400
then had a son and a PHS flag was the I
expect at all or at least value to say

153
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,740
to black

154
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:52,490
now we now we r do 2d we or we call our
cause

155
00:15:52,490 --> 00:16:01,550
so supposing mp4 for our . esta avenue
in her its opinion

156
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:05,390
obviously there is a pee-pee agent
directory

157
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:15,560
t-boz the happier we start we are doing
some so much hair cut on the visa visa

158
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,910
functional m.o.d power to entry to this
function

159
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:30,140
they are either a sec the take back and
just that half of the packet slot is a

160
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:37,819
either around towards the current her
current her . ami or not if not her then

161
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:46,190
with her foster and this is a in common
any comments circumstances either where

162
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:55,910
we pass them at their next up the check
tool and it is a function we are txt the

163
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,800
new peds our people and for the people
angle with the said her it all we all do

164
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:12,620
next the much heavier and able to the
people angle words or colada and then it

165
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,800
was we are updated the entry directly

166
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,599

167
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,319
if we want for you to the day p do when
we master said that the people anger

168
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,510
toward a tool that

169
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,530
so has the table and a day

170
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,900
go to the next part but net and next
attack

171
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,760
this is terrible this function we are

172
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,040
comparative PD is a reserved word of
peace was said how are not her pay for

173
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,899
it harder said her because it is over
the bead so it will if we toured the

174
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,050
said her there a man you used to be
security

175

176
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,840
his passion so every day we don't
resolve with the beads will set her then

177

peace what do you call a new key the
media and i have been beaten then the

188
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,908
faster as we are one either

189
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:46,380
and they are they give you and updated
the entry relatively and we are not a

190
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:54,390
good for the the check file check the
file well to some odds are already in

191
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,559
her start under their castle and God huh

192
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,200
but her it will are we partner we pass
the time

193
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:14,519
faster has the check our a coda floor we
are not go to the check foul it we are

194
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:22,350
and and her if we are done here that our
returns the other means the memory

195
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,990
allocated to the operation is a success

196
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,840
well here is the week of all a logical

197
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:43,380
so I need the tour triggered her a treat
to the diesel where we can all logic

198
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,159
O'Toole

199
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:54,570
I'm sorry memory read and write and yeah
and yeah some step so there's a lot we

200
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,000
are Locker a normal page

201
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:08,279
II the easy memory be around for the
current dominant and day they paint and

202
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,389
a new page

203
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:16,590
the new Peter we call them hate DPD's
mfa neither security vie de are

204
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,860
conditions and how they need to learn
how to use the time she beats all were

205
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:32,760
the PJ and my friend must be 0 that
means that if we are

206
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:42,240
that means that if we use the use this
and this with our address that and are

207
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,779
super Patriots and I get a master

208
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:55,380
mmm well it's a matinee tackle you and
your friends and her easy you use found

209
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:07,139
the ideal for is a tool to matter abuse
data for our use a little control and

210
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:09,030
that's all we know

211
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:17,100
a log on you . we had a baby . we also
need a tour and you find some conditions

212
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:28,050
and that means a the page be master low
located either use the full megabusa

213
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,840
memory Iraq

214
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:38,459
so then Axl will chase her away we just
started out as a pager pager beat and a

215
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,980
normal or PT and then we read the thread

216
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,190
yeah he paid a a normal

217
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,260
Peter normal PT no more teams are no
more candy

218
00:22:53,310 --> 00:23:08,250
oh thank you note on her for any higher
. he baza the w flank right a flanger

219
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:16,140
rather flattered Kobe said who act and
this is this rental angle also put Abby

220
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,010
said 21

221
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:27,180
only then how is there only charity the
hour you how are you

222
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:38,910
I mean the pd pd is a writable flanger
it's a 10 if we say that the PA and PB

223
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:45,270
is a rather read about flanger towards
the arrow and they have a user would

224
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,580
another concern about eight

225
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,500
so now the ps4 anger is a zero

226
00:23:52,500 --> 00:24:02,550
next we really ready to haul a week more
lovely and a set of the chairs and

232
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,210
and I

233
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:40,000
right above the water said we cool a
rather ball ran out of the ground ball

234
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,380
to your tormentor beat some memories and
knows her

235
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:51,220
there is a page table will help you how
to reduce their the pager eight and the

236
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,760
normal . table so we will now

237
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,690
now we have a week for the rather and a
right

238
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:09,010
the deep hatred Heba if we put the rapid
is it did he bought that mean we coulda

239
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:14,050
read that and our autumn more chain
memory

240
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:21,100
this belonged with the current her know
me and that this would be around for all

241
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:28,330
our drama and a decent may be buried on
me and better bury our memory any memory

242
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,330
we could a change to read and write

243
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:39,670
ok now other trees are the trigger
enhance the arbitrary mirchi memory

244
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,650
rather our time we need a tool use the
salmon technologies at all

245

248
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:15,130

this page we coulda a four-hour coder

249
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:22,330
user model may be here we may be a good
with maybe room with the root of

250
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:31,840
religious and there may be with the
normal normal normal user privileges did
