1
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,830
thank you and thanks for having me back
to spite him

2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,509
all it's always an honor to be asked to
give a keynote

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,710
actually I don't get asked that often so
I want to make it sound like a Duke eat

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,990
all the time because i don't but one of
the really cool things about doing a

5
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,580
keynote is you know normally you're
presenting material that you really know

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,640
inside out and you've been working on
maybe four years and you've got your

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,879
latest greatest export and you can't
wait to show it but with a keynote you

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,140
get to take a look at kind of step back
and look at the bigger picture and

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,519
realize we're all doomed

10
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,089
basically so that was fun and
interesting

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:01,540
so before we start just give you a bit
of background apps your labs is my

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,658
company is a small company there's two
of us basically we do research into

13
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:15,369
embedded systems and we do a lot of work
in CN I assurance start looking at smart

14
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,080
meters and that kind of thing

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:26,230
basically I'm I'm the code monkey
basically and my partner his chipmunky

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,140
so he looks at all the hardware stuff

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,640
Gary analog and with chemicals and bad
stuff like that and I I deal with all

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,730
the nice bits and bytes and trying to
make sanity out of it as I say we are

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,630
very small

20
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,729
we work we tend to work in you know we
get called in a specialist in in teams

21
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,510
that are doing a bigger job or we'll put
the job together and we just focus on

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,909
the bit we good at and get other people
in

23
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:59,170
I personally I'm old school I've been
doing this for a very very long time

24
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,679
actually since the eighties I do
describe myself as a hacker not a

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,650
security consultant is hacking school
they all right so when you try to

26
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,269
impress a girl if i'm at dinner and I'm
telling people what i do i do so i'm

27
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,909
actually normally I open with on a porn
star

28
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:24,609
but spending how they react i'm a switch
back to America but the package called

29
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,319
out so it's okay to say you're a hacker

30
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,299
I'm involved in def com

31
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,720
staff there again for way too long

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,760
19 years now I've been lurking in a back
room at DEFCON if you ever come how many

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,440
people here have been too difficult

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,040
loads of you ok you probably never will
have seen me in this I happen to be

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,290
giving a talk or pushing a lot of
Pelican cases around some back alley

36
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,980
somewhere in the conference but if
you're there come and see me I hang out

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,209
in curing stores if you're in London
last tuesday of the month

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,340
so next tuesday we have a regular
monthly meeting in central London we

39
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,690
take over a pub what we take over the
ground floor of a pub or seller of a pub

40
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,170
actually we have a couple of talks

41
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,679
it's actually really good where we
usually have around a hundred people

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,870
show up so totally free anyone can walk
in and we're always looking for material

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,620
so if anyone wants to come and give her
an off-the-cuff talk

44
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,310
I try and open source pretty much
everything I do

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm a terrible blogger so my blog I
don't think I've I put anything on it

46
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,970
for at least a year but if I do anything
I consider interesting or exciting are

47
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,870
tempted to try and remember to blog
about it but i will almost certainly

48
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,540
publisher even if i don't get around to
blogging it

49
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,540
so what I'm legally allowed to publish I
do

50
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,840
ok so before we get started we'll go
through some disclaimers

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,350
so I don't get sued obviously my
opinions comments of my own

52
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:03,440
not necessarily those of my company
although companies have me so probably

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,850
mostly true bunch of images and video
clips in this talk which all copyright

54
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,140
their respected owners and you should
obviously respect copyright I'm a great

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,060
believer in respecting copyright

56
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,839
I try not to - rip things off

57
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,840
but in this case

58
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,138
so if i have ripped off your ship on

59
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,139
sorry

60
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,310
yeah

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,000
I mean what the fuck if you're going to
try and stop me from ripping stuff

62
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,680
do it properly it's just embarrassing
but on the other hand

63
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,380
some people take this stuff really
seriously

64
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,859
we're going to talk about a lot of
products here and obviously those

65
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,450
products mean a lot to people

66
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,969
so what I mean by this is if if I say
something bad about your product I'm i

67
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,560
apologize i'm taking things out of
context and I don't you know I

68
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,770
understand your baby is actually really
cute and cuddly

69
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,299
whatever it is but i'm probably going to
take the piss out of it

70
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:38,990
ok so and for everything else that
happens I apologize in advance so we're

71
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,360
going to talk about the Internet of
Things

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,780
that's the main overarching subject

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:55,070
we'll talk a little bit about what it is
and then that well actually that was my

74
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,120
original plan but then I realized you
know you've been in Amsterdam a couple

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,630
of days

76
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,909
you probably a bit tired and hungover we
got a bit of a rash developing it's

77
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,750
definitely gonna hurt when you pee by
the time you get home so i didn't want

78
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,570
to bum you out too much so I change that

79
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,420
so we're actually going to talk about
the WWWF things which is the way the

80
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,740
wonderful in the worrying

81
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
so you'll see as we go along

82
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,880
I've kind of as I found each thing to
talk about i just gave it a general

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,740
category at the top of the slide

84
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,240
they'll be a weird and wonderful or
worrying and they're not necessarily in

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,500
any particular order anymore they were
when i started but it's all gone crazy

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,520
since then - and then if we got time at
the end we'll discuss why we care about

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,090
this

88
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,940
actually my time is not running so I see
you might go all the time in the world

89
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,440
and I'm not tracking and it's only a
coffee break afterwards right

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,660
so first i'll let you feast your eyes on
that

91
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,110
that's very well-thought-out lucid
sensible slide which clearly I didn't

92
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,680
produce someone that is our I consulting
did and that's probably the last slide

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,810
in the whole talk that makes any sense

94
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,510
the rest of it can only be described as
a slowly evolving train crash

95
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,340
yes but one of those things you just you
know you want to look away but you call

96
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:32,979
so this is actually quite accurate when
I found it is by okay well when i first

97
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,290
came across the term internet of things
it did seem to apply just to rfid and I

98
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,720
was doing a lot of working rfid at the
time and it was just like okay let's use

99
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,190
rfid tags

100
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,990
instead of typing in the URL so this is
like a shortcut that link to to

101
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,640
something else and that's when they
started like linking rfid tags to the

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,750
internet because you would go bit and it
would launch a browser and go somewhere

103
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,790
or some something like that and it's
gradually evolved as the sensors have

104
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,419
got better and cheaper and we are
embedding more stuff into things

105
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,849
the Internet of Things is actually
started expanding until we're you know

106
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,800
we're actually overtaking this timeline
and 2020 it's like we're way past what

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,870
what they're saying is going to happen
by then

108
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,340
in fact you know it's evolved to the
state where it's just everything

109
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,469
everything is part of Internet of Things
and actually even graphic designers

110
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,810
can't get a handle on it anymore

111
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,870
but how do i represent the internet
things because it's just everything you

112
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:44,620
know it works in farms in infrastructure
school school kids are going to learn

113
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,910
all about stuff that we teachers drawing
little diagrams it's going to go in the

114
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,930
cloud

115
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,469
you know every other cities are going to
be smart cities talking to each other if

116
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,660
you've got a logo that will be in there
somewhere

117
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,550
you know brand it's going to be an
academy when you learn all about the

118
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,290
Internet of Things I wouldn't put my
power station next to the burning forest

119
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,259
but you know

120
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:09,619
internet of things you can do what you
want it's kind of a free for everyone

121
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,449
can can play

122
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:16,219
it's going to be you know things will be
in space

123
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,100
you know where we're going to have
laptops orbiting the planet and you'll

124
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,419
be able to scoop that up

125
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,429
take it with you when you go to work
it's gonna be wonderful men made of

126
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:34,129
stars and cities that talk to men made
of starves buildings that are so

127
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,649
complicated there's no room for labels
anymore

128
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:42,109
trains that carry enormous radio
stations just crazy

129
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:45,709
the Internet of Things is crazy Oh x-ray
watch that tells you if you're a

130
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,669
sidewalk

131
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:53,478
that's my favorite so that you know the
pace of change is just unbelievable

132
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,809
everything's happening everything's
being connected everything is being

133
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:03,139
thrown in together and as a security guy
that's a problem

134
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,279
so that's pretty much my manager as a
security guy

135
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,270
yeah I come along to look at your
product

136
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,529
I'm going to tell you it's broken and if
you change it you're gonna break it even

137
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,810
worse so you know you're screwed either
way

138
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,810
that's my job why I'm here to give you
problems not solutions

139
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,410
that's your problem

140
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,160
okay so now we've kind of set the ground
rules

141
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:42,270
let's start looking at some of the stuff
that's out there and you know life is

142
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,670
confusing and the Internet of Things

143
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,920
there's a lot of gadgets that will help
you to understand counter interact with

144
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,779
this crazy world we live in

145
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,000
then to make it more fun and one of the
first i came across when I was

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,510
researching this answers this question

147
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,810
so if you've ever been in a relationship
you know this this is a bad question you

148
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,800
never want to hear this

149
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,740
this is a trap it there's no correct
answer to this question unless you

150
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,670
really got your a-game on and you answer
like at the slightest hesitation or

151
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,079
nuance in your voice

152
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,690
you're going to be in so much trouble so
if the Internet of Things can answer

153
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,850
that question for us

154
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,850
so if you get it wrong this is going to
happen

155
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:36,889
can you hear that

156
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,139
I don't want to help but my wife don't
at all right

157
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,220
don't fucking you meet your goals

158
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,600
ok don't fucking nothing that you're
going to say is going to make me forget

159
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:58,429
that I love my white is there she comes
home from working in about an hour and a

160
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:58,970
half

161
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,209
graveyard shift at the hospital

162
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,949
you got to make some phone calls going
to cause some people doing

163
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:11,269
get the fuck out of my house when she
gets here it's cool in the game

164
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,019
so you don't want that kind of shit
right

165
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,319
you don't want to get divorced because
you answer the question roll

166
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:22,998
so the Internet of Things is going to
help us by answering that question for

167
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,999
you

168
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,610
make it look like a mirror first glance
but it's not like any mirror over soon

169
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,700
when I look into other mirrors all I see
is a reflection

170
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
I see today

171
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:48,709
the truth is so much more than that
naked shows me my truth my truth is

172
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,758
sweat early mornings one wrap

173
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,290
one mile what were second

174
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,430
I'm stronger than I think I can go
further than I thought

175
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,069
- naked truth is that what i look like
today is not a moment frozen in time

176
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,840
my body is the reflection of my journey
my choices

177
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,990
that's where make it helps me to my true
self naked is a 3d fitness tracker that

178
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,220
keeps me motivated

179
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,590
by showing me my promise I can instantly
get my exact measurement body fat

180
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,730
percentage of weight and muscle gaining
fast

181
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,329
said comparison

182
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:37,868
time lapse of the bodies changes I know
where I am

183
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,499
where I'm going

184
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,499
and how to get there

185
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,689
I'm on a journey to become my best out
this is me naked

186
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,999
pretty amazing huh so I never have to
answer that question

187
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,199
it's like look at your 3d model you are
to the question

188
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,189
trouble is that they can turn this
around and pointed back at you

189
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,410
yeah

190
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,569
we have a term for that is called pussy
whipped

191
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:25,580
so I don't know why his reward was that
the bat but you know and i don't know if

192
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,040
you noticed but his breakfast was one
grape

193
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,540
ok so that that's not breakfast in my
house in my house

194
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:42,470
this is actually one of the most awesome
things on the Internet

195
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:58,779
a little bit more anger

196
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:18,740
you don't want to start over too much to
leave right now

197
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,910
yeah

198
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:37,520
yeah

199
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:48,760
yeah

200
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,899
I don't know how we ever managed before
the internet and Kickstarter of course

201
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:06,010
Thank You Kickstarter but actually
obviously as a geek I can't cook but I

202
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,369
do still need a proper breakfast so if
only there were something Internet of

203
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,369
Things please help me

204
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,450
yeah

205
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,540
so even as a geek I can now put the
perfect meal and I know it's going to be

206
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,570
perfect because the pan told me I got
the ingredients right about the time

207
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,340
right everything is wonderful but i'm
not going to just sit down and eat it

208
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,570
right you crazy

209
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,070
I have to put it on my smart plate and
my smart plate will tell me if I'm

210
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,800
allowed to eat it

211
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,840
No in this case I'm not allowed to eat
the lovely pastor I have to eat some

212
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,399
white bread some white toast as i'd
rather have four fried chickens and a

213
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,700
coke but now I get what toast

214
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,030
so that's what I'm going to be because
that's the healthy option

215
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:00,149
oh well as we go to i've added these
like pro tips

216
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,150
so if I spot something I think we could
improve upon

217
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,350
i'll give you a pro tip my tip here is

218
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,350
yeah you don't eat white bread at one
thirty in the morning

219
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:19,860
the kebab is way way better to that soak
up the alcohol so and this is a smart

220
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,979
spoon how can you have breakfast without
a smart spoon

221
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,840
its sole function seems to be to tell
you not to put mustard in your coffee

222
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,060
because that's disgusting

223
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:37,500
but I've tried it it's actually
discussed and then having a hearty

224
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,390
breakfast it's now time to get dressed

225
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,570
so obviously we need internet of things
to help us do this properly if you're a

226
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,460
lady of the female persuasion

227
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,420
obviously you need the ultimate broad
and if you can read that from there but

228
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,850
this makes you be the boss and to the
you have real-time biometrics

229
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:04,469
so we all need that obviously you need
some digital panties because internet

230
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,460
thinks

231
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,790
oh and some of that as well as the pro
tips I've got the the hacking advice

232
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:20,620
ok so i love the way he is just casually
hanging on the the no hawk outside so I

233
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,489
can be bad

234
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,910
anytime I like so clearly again i don't
know if you can see the writing here but

235
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,070
we're seeing a repeating pattern in this

236
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,090
so they obviously used ECB mode which is
why would you do that

237
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,920
so Jack advice do not use ECB movie

238
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,140
the guy is a lot simpler you have this
lovely dish or onesie

239
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,650
you can put on now here's a great
invention

240
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,940
so I don't know about you but I always
have trouble keeping track of how many

241
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,670
socks i put on it

242
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,600
and they've solved this problem for us
now so with digital Sox that's no longer

243
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,679
an issue

244
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,680
so you have your digital sock and you
have this

245
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,409
I'm not sure where you wear that it
looks kind of uncomfortable but

246
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,390
nevermind be wearing it and as we can
see the app is telling us while I can

247
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,060
see your right foot and if I don't see
your left foot in about 36 seconds

248
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm calling an ambulance because

249
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,300
you've got a problem

250
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
great innovation no more stock misery

251
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,280
digital blobs obviously you need those
smart gloves

252
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,450
I'm not sure what the snakes for but
he's a little friends you can take with

253
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,810
you haven't figured that one out yet

254
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,320
before you leave the house obviously you
look in your smart mirror and the smart

255
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,980
mirror tells you if you're fit to go so
it gives you a school even it can tell

256
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,650
how much booze you've had everything I
mean it just it

257
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:09,370
one glance and it note and again my pro
tip you can't possibly leave the house

258
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,179
with that school

259
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:21,730
Jesus come on so you need to moisturize
and I like this last because its hips

260
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,510
too friendly

261
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,500
you know there's no reason you can't
have a big lumberjack beard and not be

262
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,670
moist at the same time so it doesn't
cover the whole place

263
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,300
obviously you need to brush your teeth
in the brave news

264
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,580
the Internet of Things well I mean I
just leave mine like that to do it while

265
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm doing all the other things and you
gotta floss

266
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,720
otherwise it's going to tweak that you
have poor dental hygiene

267
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,810
so then all your friends will know

268
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:04,389
so now you got dressed and you suddenly
realizes forgot to go number two

269
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,810
but luckily you're smart toilet will
tell you like how many times have you

270
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,370
did you go yet

271
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,000
did you go before you went out you
should have gone before you went now but

272
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
their smartphones will tell you

273
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,380
smart toilet will tell you now it's
pretty self-explanatory what a smart i

274
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,630
was going to do but even so the
manufacturers hopefully put this

275
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,630
information on his website

276
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:39,910
I promise I have not tampered with these
these are directly from the

277
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:49,480
manufacturers website so informative to
the points and synced & because you did

278
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,900
it all backwards now you have to strip
off get back in the show

279
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,900
now I was going to make this approach to
it but it's pretty damn obvious

280
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,070
I didn't think it was worth wasting a
protip sticker on it

281
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,270
wearing Google glass into the shower
does not make it a smart out

282
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,490
ok it makes you a dumb it's probably
broken your google glass

283
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,239
I have no idea what this is I put it in
because I know there's some people from

284
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,310
San Francisco here maybe they can
explain some magical internet of thing

285
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:27,159
device that you walk towards it and they
cleaned you I don't know what does it do

286
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,220
anyone know no magic into next thing as
magic

287
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,330
ok so you've had the shower you got
dressed again you've got your smart on

288
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,840
to know what that task but it's clearly
a smart sure you've got your smart shoes

289
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,699
on

290
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,110
this is what you get if you search for
smart pants

291
00:24:53,110 --> 00:25:00,939
ok so i had to search for smart trousers
and see what they did there

292
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,090
internet of trousers haha i OT

293
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:15,100
you've got your smart hoodie and because
you're a cyclist in Amsterdam

294
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,399
you've got your airbags mark jacket
thing it's the way of the future i tell

295
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:28,178
you and I don't know but about you but
at this point i would have worked up

296
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:29,169
quite a sweat

297
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:32,590
getting on with stuff together came
across this

298
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,549
so there's a lot of stuff for hydration
but this is a particularly special one

299
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,049
for people who sweat

300
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,158
ok everyone else forget it you need a
different product but if you sweat

301
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:50,110
this one's for you ok one last thing to
check before we leave the house

302
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,820
shall we and here your gaming consoles
going to help

303
00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:01,199
morning

304
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,299
with a sense to voice the magic but

305
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,490
yeah

306
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,149
this will be fun to play with

307
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,539
and it was

308
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,869
something amazing started

309
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,340
ok so you get it

310
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,350
the xbox can see you and it reacts to to
what you're doing that's what could be

311
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,389
wrong with that

312
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,900
the new xbox one set to release later
this week

313
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,850
can't see your penis that's a shocking
discovery made by fast company designs

314
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,649
mark.wilson after uploading a video
analysis of the new consoles features

315
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,690
Wilson wrote quote while I'd intended to
post a about the tech demo the improved

316
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,580
connect from microsoft research

317
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,169
I noticed alongside the intricacies of
accordion jeans and there's no graceful

318
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,390
way to say this dog

319
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,310
that's right the Kinect system infrared
cameras now so sensitive that similar to

320
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,860
a tsa millimeters away on his owner

321
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,280
it shows a clear outline of your
genitalia

322
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,300
wilson also reveals the embarrassment
announcing now the system picked up the

323
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:19,149
outline of his own penis during xbox one
testing at microsoft campus in redmond

324
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,900
taken on its own it might be easy to
dismiss when you consider the fact that

325
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,810
Microsoft matrix X pot was deeply
embroiled in the NSA wiretapping scandal

326
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:34,629
allowing the snooping agency backdoor
access to spy on users of its services

327
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:39,370
things begin to get unsettling the user
will not be able to power on the new

328
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,199
xbox one without first enabling connect
and standing in front of its camera

329
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,800
the system also requires that it be
connected to the internet at least once

330
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
every 24 hours

331
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,409
the device will also track your eye
movements to report which adds you watch

332
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,740
as well as using its array of
microphones to enable voice

333
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,200
interactivity and distinguished your
voice from other people in the room so I

334
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,149
guess we just have to trust the
microsoft recording

335
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:10,309
pass on the audio about conversations to
the NSA just like it did with the data

336
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:13,729
of other individuals who use its
Microsoft services

337
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,658
pretty freaky huh

338
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:24,169
so anyway if you want to make that test
before you go out that your NSA wearing

339
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:31,999
NSA approved power and that will help
you know and then your fridge magnets

340
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,729
going to talk to you when you when you
leave the building

341
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:37,759
I am that you know

342
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,729
actually before we watch this one you
have to notice how earnest this guy is

343
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:49,159
I mean these guys they love their
products and just just watches faces

344
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,460
that's lovely I am that you know a lot
of companies with you think about how to

345
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,159
get a new device in your mind

346
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:03,820
and we're going to be more about why why
not take the proving to make it that

347
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,779
much better

348
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:09,429
she doesn't always on digital sticking
out I need to protect rain and a

349
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:14,619
peel-and-stick not acknowledging my
hands-free access to know

350
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,519
update this is actually really cool i
mean when i wrote why

351
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,039
abstract for this talk I hadn't come
across this and i'm in the abstract it

352
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,570
does actually mention that because I
white board posting I know kind of

353
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:33,908
automatic message thing when you don't
turn out someone's done it obviously any

354
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:37,299
good idea you have some already got it

355
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:40,539
so yeah this will tell you if it's
raining outside

356
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:49,720
ok so you need number as you leave that
I t can also help with your everyday

357
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,769
tasks

358
00:29:50,769 --> 00:30:02,169
I'm worried no I'm wearing know that it
causes feedback so but he's got

359
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:04,989
can you just turn this one are you
having trouble hearing me I'm I'm

360
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:09,639
mumbling too much out of the video been
using that one

361
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:20,049
I'll try with that one as well so we had
a problem this morning with my

362
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,450
microphone output my headphone output

363
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:29,289
ok so I OT can also help with everyday
tasks so we've established that it can

364
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:33,700
weigh you and measure you and so on the
kinect way my baby

365
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,629
how often does my baby poop

366
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,629
how much just the poop way

367
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,790
ok

368
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,790
obviously I really need to know

369
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,730
being a new parent is accelerating and
exhausted

370
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:59,408
it's a lot more worried

371
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:03,309
hey you know what i want to do with a
newborn when you bring them home

372
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,440
this whole experience without being a
mom is unlike anything anybody can

373
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,549
prepare you for

374
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,750
we develop the smart changing pad to
make it easy to track your baby's weight

375
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:21,820
meetings diaper changes all the
information thanks to your phone so you

376
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,668
can see and your baby is growing at your
baby nurses during feeding and keep

377
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:30,190
track of how much you would be sleeping

378
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,330
it's really anxious about whether i was
making enough know that after using this

379
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,658
by changing and it showed me that I was
actually producing their milk

380
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:43,029
next thing that is happening I was
totally checking maybe as part of our

381
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:45,610
routine use me time and maybe

382
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:51,158
how cool is that you just internet of
things to the rescue yet again but I

383
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,380
mean that's only the beginning

384
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,970
all right i think in the future what
we'll see is you just connect directly

385
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,769
to the implants in your baby's brain you
read out the information you need and

386
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,389
you can send commands in

387
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,658
so fill your diaper there we go

388
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:17,080
ok sorted and it can help you improve
your skills some things are just part

389
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,500
you know they really are and the
Internet of Things can help with that

390
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,130
so lying in the sun for example that's
that's tricky

391
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,280
yeah

392
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:34,899
yeah

393
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,190
yeah

394
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,060
because everyone looks like that is
going to work

395
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,040
don't touch up

396
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:16,489
yeah

397
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:29,659
- well on the way to solving all of my
little problems again standing walking

398
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:36,230
bottle sitting for that can be trippin
for another one day your papers are

399
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,880
already piled up and urban just remember
to give you that that was due two days

400
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,510
ago

401
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,770
stupid or event it's really 122 and
there's more work to be done and the

402
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:51,980
vaccines striking particular local there
that Sally and Sally isn't worried about

403
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,070
being stressed or dealing with
unnecessary backgrounds

404
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:01,070
why she uses Dharma and with Dharma she
said smart using highly sensitive fiber

405
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,990
optic sensors Dharma measures precisely
how you sit then through the Dharma nap

406
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,668
and coaches you to sit better and also
tell you she had beans for breakfast

407
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,389
no one should sit for too long

408
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:18,760
Sharma has a built-in timer and remind
you when it's the right time to stand up

409
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:25,989
sometimes people have dad sitting habits
learning how you sit there with guide

410
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,000
you through specific stretches to
counteract those bad habits

411
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,059
so you get the idea funny thing is this
is a real thing that's that's obviously

412
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:40,119
made it to market now because having
look for it

413
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,079
I'm constantly being bombarded with
adverse to buy the damn thing now

414
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:52,779
so my amazon cart is preloaded with half
a dozen dollars and actually I OT

415
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:56,799
anything you can think of wanting to do
better i OT can help you

416
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:04,660
you want to be the best at everything
you do right if picking your nose is

417
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,140
your thing then we can help

418
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:15,609
and sometimes it will remind you you
know in daily life you can be just going

419
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:18,700
about your business and you just
completely forget there's something that

420
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,049
you really need to do have to get this
important thing that's something I do

421
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:28,029
every day but sometimes i forget to do
and I want a smart device to just remind

422
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,619
me to do this thing

423
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:36,400
oh and pro tip again if you're going to
design a sensor that is to be used like

424
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,740
every day then it needs to be invisible
or unobtrusive at least look really cool

425
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,779
so it looks like this that

426
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,960
no yeah looks like this

427
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:58,000
cool who doesn't love a bluetooth
headset so anyway

428
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,670
try to remember the smart important
thing ok

429
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,650
no that one fails on both counts it's
neither unobtrusive nor cool looking

430
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,730
that's getting there I mean it looks
kind of cool but still a little bit over

431
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:18,030
the top

432
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:26,400
if you don't mind looking like the board
then that's ok now we have a real

433
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,150
solution

434
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,150
this one is gonna

435
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,869
yeah

436
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,580
children with that you're still mine

437
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,460
yeah

438
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
yeah

439
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,180
so this is important stuff she was about
to die she forgot to breathe

440
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,669
ok reminded her to breathe back to life

441
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:22,840
everything's good bedtime i'll sleep is
very important to decide to do something

442
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,360
about it and we design every aspect of
how beds and mattresses are made

443
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,819
will you come from

444
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,710
is that we're trying to utilize modern
design and technology to produce bed

445
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,890
that you have full control so you can
customize it any way you wish the answer

446
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,779
suspension system is very unique

447
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:56,470
again you get a smart bed that was a
thinly disguised the ploy to introduce

448
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,009
the next topic and i'm running a bit
short i'm not going to bother with that

449
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,010
that felt so speaking of bedtime

450
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:09,070
obviously we have the whole sex toy
industry and this is crazy

451
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,430
I mean I could have done this entire
talk just on sex toys you guys just

452
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:20,348
can't get enough of this stuff and
combining functions

453
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,540
I'm not quite sure why but wow

454
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,109
hey you can do as a Bluetooth connection
send audio down

455
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:36,819
who knows what might happen but yeah i
mean like i say this could have been

456
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,880
hundreds and hundreds of slides on this
topic the only reason I stopped where I

457
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,720
did was because like most speakers i
leave everything to the last minute so I

458
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,490
was like doing this on the train and i'm
adding slides and I'm working away and i

459
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,419
made my little bubble and then I
realized that all the chatter and the

460
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,880
coach behind me is gone and it's really
quiet and I kind of look around

461
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,940
yes you don't want to be doing this on
the track it

462
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,940
Spritle

463
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,650
yeah just really weird and crazy stuff

464
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,290
there's loads of them I'm I like this
one because it it thinks about

465
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:20,150
discreteness you know if you're going to
have one of these devices you don't want

466
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,840
to be using a great big obvious handheld
thing you know put it on a wristwatch

467
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,910
that's that makes it a little more
discreet and actually distance distance

468
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,660
is the key

469
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,589
when you're doing weird robot sex
distance is the key

470
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,910
ok and here they've got this exactly
right i mean if I'm doing you from

471
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,379
behind 10 feet is fine because you can't
see me right

472
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,430
anyway you're looking the other way but
if i'm in front of you

473
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:52,670
30 feets good cause I'm just as some guy
back there fiddling with you

474
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,830
30 feet away so it's great i like that
they have thought about stuff like that

475
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:05,690
look at the meeting my needs and you're
obviously not just for the ladies

476
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,149
so there are some sex toys that are
actually trying to work for couples as

477
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,580
well but as you can see this campaign
failed

478
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:18,080
I mean they only got halfway through
campaigns over this is obviously a toy

479
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,080
that's designed to work with the mail
involved as well but girls don't want

480
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,200
that they don't want cyborgs they want
full of robots

481
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
ok no men involved so that fail

482
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,230
not interested on the air on the other
hand this guy is only halfway through

483
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,390
his campaign he's already gone over so
they're going to get built

484
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:49,790
but this is for ladies and and actually
everything I looked at for ladies own

485
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,779
and that arts is one of the questions is
ongoing debate you know

486
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,250
are there enough women in tech and this
doesn't answer that question but it

487
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,640
certainly officers the question is there
enough taking women

488
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:09,078
and i think the house is yes this
planting is visual but we are missing

489
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:15,079
one important market and you know it's
pretty obvious and i'm surprised i

490
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,920
couldn't find more for that market but
you know you've got your your classic

491
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,839
computer nerd sort of sad geek spend all
day in front of a computer probably

492
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,009
wears a black teacher you know crap

493
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,809
yeah yeah so your typical computer note
and there's nothing there's nothing for

494
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:33,559
it

495
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,559
so we got you covered

496
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:47,479
you can reuse existing technology and
this guy actually gives you important

497
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,609
information as you go along

498
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:52,609
I think it could be a winner

499
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,099
and by reusing other technologies you
know when you're done

500
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:09,489
ok enough about franchising what about
actually getting internet of things

501
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,619
involved in the real thing

502
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:17,229
so this is in the video will start in
the second so in the old days it worked

503
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:20,078
like this you know I meets girl

504
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,880
chemistry in this case old guy meets
attractive young woman

505
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
chemistry

506
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,910
get some updates in the water

507
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,980
so they can just discard that tech get
rid of it

508
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,400
it's getting in the way take that off
take that off

509
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,050
get down to business

510
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,549
yeah

511
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:28,489
as I used to be done internet things no
it's not gonna work like that anymore

512
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:32,329
your devices will decide if the time is
right

513
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:36,259
ok and haven't had a few important
things like is it consensual

514
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,640
you know are you actually supposed to be
having sex at this point and if no i

515
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,609
haven't quite worked out what's going to
happen next but there should be some

516
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:50,690
automatic like response if everything's
wrong and it shouldn't be happening

517
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:54,319
maybe it contains you or something

518
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:01,130
if you're wearing flares or you're
trying to do something you shouldn't now

519
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,809
testing and this is tricky

520
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,049
you know we can't go around zapping
humans

521
00:44:06,049 --> 00:44:12,920
so we've been testing it on a dog and
it's not perfect yet but at least with

522
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,930
this version when the dog dies it leaves
a chalk outline so the forensics guys

523
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,578
going to figure out what happened

524
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:27,049
we're making progress but in the real
world again this is real technology

525
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:33,440
so here we have a smart bra that detects
the woman's heart rate and based on the

526
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,819
heart rate it's going to decide do you
get to second base

527
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:46,729
so out calculates the app calculates the
heart rate and if it's the true love

528
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:49,759
heart rate the bar opens

529
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,670
you carry out this is a real product is
real

530
00:44:55,210 --> 00:45:00,490
I am NOT making this shit up now

531
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,839
the hackers in the room obviously they
can see the floor in this plan

532
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:09,849
well i was just based on the heart rate
well yeah you can run on the spot where

533
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:11,200
i can chase around the bed

534
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:18,009
you know we'll get that right off and
bad but no scientists have figured out

535
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:24,790
that when women run their boobs bounce
and that creates train on the straps i

536
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,020
mean i knew this because I want to be a
watch but you know scientists did a lot

537
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,569
of research and they they work that out

538
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:34,900
so I think by combining the two we can
solve that problem

539
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:40,329
so if you're trying to hack the system
that and we'll work the digital panties

540
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,010
in there somewhere as well

541
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:50,829
all good digital pills again this is a
real thing you're gonna swallow the pill

542
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:57,160
that's gonna start sending messages back
to the outside world so automatic

543
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,490
morning after pill I don't know crazy

544
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:07,960
yeah I need another drink after that I
had run out of time on

545
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,200
I'm over running now and I don't care
but please put your hands up and tell me

546
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,950
to stop if if your eyes can't take
anymore but we lost sound on that one

547
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,950
and I wanted something stronger anyway

548
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,540
ok so back to normal programming we are
actually running out of time so I'm just

549
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:38,100
going to skip through these some of the
more worries and smart key pad

550
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,110
convenient way to lock and unlock your
August smart lock using unique entry

551
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:49,890
codes the office smart key pad is simple
to set up easy to use and control your

552
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,190
August smartlock be a bluetooth with the
August mark you

553
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,049
there's a lot of that I mean locks
digital locks and so on becoming or any

554
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:03,960
common of IOT logs when I first round

555
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:14,790
amazon didn't know what do you want
let's see is it for everyone

556
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:23,070
it's called Amazon echo I think I'm just
finishing up right now is it's always on

557
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:31,260
no it only hears you would use the
wakeboard we chose alexa alexa so what

558
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,100
do you do

559
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,960
I can play music answer questions get
the news and weather create to do with

560
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,220
too much more

561
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,899
alexa play rock rock music

562
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,569
Alexis Rhiannon like that

563
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:54,250
what time is it The Times 327 actually
don't have to yell at it

564
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,680
ok uses for the technology so we can
hear you from anywhere in the world are

565
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,690
filled technology i feel safer now
listening to me anywhere in the room

566
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,930
what could possibly go wrong and yeah
just stops worrying we're putting more

567
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,190
weight loss technologies which are just
intruding into our lives and snooping on

568
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,569
everything we do and we just we're not
just taking it for granted with paying

569
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:24,250
to have this crap in your hands and
feeding back to who knows where

570
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,750
so you have a smart like bold

571
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:35,140
it's smart because you can control it
from your phone you can turn it off on

572
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,269
this is high few different products that
are trying to tie all this stuff

573
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,008
together because as you've seen

574
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:46,569
I mean before I even get the hat out of
the house I've got about 60 pounds of

575
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:51,970
equipment strapped to my body so I need
some kind of overriding system that's

576
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,439
going to manage it

577
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,740
so yeah just wrapping up

578
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:02,709
why is this a problem there's just too
many attack vectors

579
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:08,920
zigbee bluetooth Wi-Fi everything is
starting to to overlap the standards are

580
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:14,079
not keeping up products are coming out
there before standards to be being

581
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,450
defined let alone ratified or applied to
those particular products we got

582
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:26,230
government initiatives to actually make
this stuff not just recommended but like

583
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:32,500
compulsory so things like smart metering
government are introducing things

584
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,119
cads consumer access device which is
going to connect all your Internet of

585
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,829
Things devices in the house

586
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:44,710
you're smart meters and everything else
so you know zigbee is a big driver

587
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:52,690
because of smart metering certainly in
UK i guess here as well and the problem

588
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:58,029
the obvious problem with zigbee is it
doesn't respect barriers I mean as you

589
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:07,150
can see this is a diagram of how someone
is showing the devices in your house

590
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:11,049
talking to each other but clearly you
know if there's a house next door that's

591
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:15,730
also got zigbee devices they're talking
to each other as well and there's no

592
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,799
reason that that could happen that you
start sending messages to your neighbors

593
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,690
devices and in fact we've done a lot of
testing with third-party devices to see

594
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,450
who will route traffic for who

595
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:32,680
and it's just built in its in the design
that even if you don't recognize a

596
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,680
device you'll you're just route the
packets for it

597
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,120
and

598
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:43,859
create these mesh network and so you
know as a result products are kind of

599
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:48,390
being developed as if they're the only
thing they have to care about and there

600
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,900
but they're doing it using these
standards that allow them to interact

601
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,760
with other problems and nobody seems to
be really worrying too much about the

602
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,900
consequence of that and the main
consequence again which I mentioned in

603
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,040
an earlier slide is the one to one
attack becomes the one too many so

604
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,790
quickly in the old days if I wanted to
attack the virus EBV i would have to go

605
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:09,720
sit up

606
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,040
can't believe we're talking about it be
as old days but i would drive outside

607
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,470
your house and I can attack the zigbee
devices if every house is full of Z

608
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:21,720
devices that can maybe be hacked

609
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,109
externally by other means then I now
consider home

610
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:34,979
attacking your zigbee devices via some
other route so and the risks are getting

611
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,690
greater it's not simply financial IP
theft anymore

612
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,480
we're talking physical security you know
devices how doors are being connected if

613
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,720
I can use your smart meters to tell me
you're not at home and then go and

614
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,100
unlock your doors and walk in and
disable your alarm or I can you know

615
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,130
cause a major blackout on the power grid

616
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,560
clearly that's a problem scarred of
devices that are connected and we as a

617
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:07,320
company that are still seeing the same
problems that we were seeing 10 years

618
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:07,770
ago

619
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:13,050
everything is just getting recycle so
again these things are being designed

620
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,440
with security from the ground up and
that's a that's a real problem

621
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:24,660
the technical talk i'm currently working
on is using an attack vector which was

622
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,069
literally the first

623
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,120
it sits on the same a lot of the the
subject matter is the same as the very

624
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,299
first talk i gave like 15 years ago

625
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,440
so literally nothing has changed it's
it's kind of insane

626
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,250
we are in coffee break time so it's your
choice if we want to have any questions

627
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,080
or just call it a day

628
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,549
it's just run the floor now

629
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,910
shocked silence apologize

630
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,930
maybe after flooding we might ask with
our butts too big

631
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,160
thank you and Larry thank you very much
for looking at this money
