1
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:22,600
thanks for listening and basically a
great honor to stand here for sharing my

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,460
name is somehow top security research
from 0 to 60 in less time eight since

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,460
the rush of women little bit last lot of
numbers are public cloud vendors have

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,850
been deeply affected after systemic
NASA's I was interesting this one with

5
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:50,590
it because it's a and I wonder a that
you are just kind of whatever they can

6
00:00:50,590 --> 00:01:00,760
be found in numbers either one that so i
started my research is beside the star

7
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,760
start sharing and me introduce my tape

8
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,960
seriously so our team is a first

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,538
perfect note la computing with delight
in sixth grade a team in China my team

10
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:20,020
are for cooling laser reserving about
our time

11
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,580
tennis of attack and defense in mr.
interrelation system originally we were

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,490
we have gained the significant humans in
neutralization filing for more gas the

13
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:41,979
Machine escaped energy and have rather
than a bit a defense product today i

14
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:48,640
would like to share the following the
search our research minute video guys

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,470
the syrup and theoretical foundation and
the details out fertilization

16
00:01:54,069 --> 00:02:01,390
it's a value for Mark and it's running
process and caper key problems we faced

17
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,590
and how I saw there is done at last and
the later i will also show two cases

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,860
which contains more details of for a
hardware device emulators wanna be a

19
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Discovery technology and I hope I could
bring new sorts to the guys and

20
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,100
I help you discovering more and more of
it is being tried in sit on the cloud

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,320
computing system we want to see me say
today oh you made clock and building

22
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:47,079
more secure another other hand I have
more researcher can go to this work and

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,840
beginning let's talk about about a block
building and its brand new attack

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,840
surface

25
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,220
hello allow his years of development are
collecting building had been turned from

26
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,859
sink single conceptions

27
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,790
- classic collections is barely a cloud
computing in a play more important to

28
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,780
draw in enterprise from walk such a
child

29
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,959
photos the most audio and communication
contain the related to individual power

30
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,730
see what is the code and the database
information related to penis and as day

31
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:37,810
two of the government's commuting later
and military rules above all this state

32
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:48,640
are start store and utilizing cloud
cloud can be divided into practical and

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,880
probably cloud chamber stop and a cloud
service providers such a Madison Ala

34
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,989
clogged and that they provide in the
private lives of services according to

35
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,420
private club

36
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:12,220
are they are deployed it is winter not
the work of enterprise used for storing

37
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,220
court

38
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,350
what relation tennis place or not really
well i think you are computing

39
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,030
conception

40
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,140
you can locate physical resources are
dynamically and flexibly the main Patrol

41
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:41,380
agents system include the kitchen and
then there then there are products

42
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,650
serious i'm literally using private
medical environment because that of its

43
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,549
extreme steam product majority of the
house' and TV and provides can popular

44
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,790
popular in public along solution

45
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,670
Oh a curse is that i will try this
number that are still doing procedure of

46
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,930
for the government

47
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:11,890
there are many related to a development
in not not just the transgender the

48
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,360
antenna have rather however is a really
hard to say

49
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,900
one of the visual now if those two
trains can turn to

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:38,620
bila many directions to me and it needed
more time to reach the conclusion server

51
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,840
supplied of its violation turn up

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,289
technology are completed different from
common source while more virtual machine

53
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,680
can operate in the organization service

54
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:59,920
additionally it all this virtual machine
working independently most lovable from

55
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,640
Christians

56
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm provided I physical devices which
are necessary into machine operation

57
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,950
such I'll appeal

58
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,340
I remember you adapters and the keyboard

59
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,060
there are probably utilizations its own
as some of their services heart are even

60
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,130
or vehicle

61
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,050
however functions can go through lies
and we can see that it's a rally a

62
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,710
meeting

63
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,909
and advanced however maybe they are
facing big screen Davis's our way to

64
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:41,260
this favor this revolution our cloud
computing hiker are the top physical

65
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:48,940
servers have originally hackers rather
our rally with rather directly

66
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:55,780
I'll had rather than certain they slip
into casting machine and a lunch tag

67
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,570
- so on and the corner of the world we
call this kind of attack

68
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:13,630
ultra machine is key which means gate is
most dangerous and Brandon note having

69
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,730
cloud computing environment

70
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:23,770
there are three staff for lunch in which
machine skipped at first too late in the

71
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,880
ring with the machine

72
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:33,520
german by running Cloud Servers or
through our attack that are making sure

73
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,169
the tiles and the water out of the
virtualization sits on by collecting

74
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,140
information in the gas machine

75
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:50,620
Alec can be completed simulated attack
by utilizing on a bit is applied to and

76
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:00,970
they can control the host machine other
as a result of the attack cat acute

77
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,500
medical coding host machine by using
tradition

78
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,850
it's or maybe our control as our
machines are benefited the internet we

79
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:19,390
can clear this is that hackers heavily
rely on whether it is during the process

80
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,360
of launching the gas emissions Cape tag

81
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,500
so whether or nor their content to pick
amount of and release he which alleged

82
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,510
incident after a nice is a billy that
hardware device emulators can be used

83
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:46,200
as on attack service so I was a the
operation principles now with US

84
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,020
senators i will take another car

85
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:57,990
I'm later as an example not network are
a data packet transfer trying to

86
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:05,040
transfer from one machine to internet
it's a person procedure in the one tab

87
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,449
po inside out

88
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,930
did flow several securest so we are
having their doing with this procedure

89
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,829
the whole proceeding include includes
five steps

90
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:27,510
so now another what did packet by using
sockets and function inside user space

91
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:34,890
of casting machine it around certain of
possible stabbing -

92
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:42,420
kernel-based dance it's on Colonel
Collins rate related to our tcp insert

93
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,589
disc did decision on the south part info
into another one package

94
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:58,470
after that the said remember system
kernel components right into the insert

95
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,760
destination

96
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,230
priceline assorted rice our internet
worker decade out of the eye that

97
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,310
package is entering into device driver
components that following into natural

98
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:21,390
car emulator and adapter our
organization system finally did it back

99
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,080
package enter into a video network are
through host and basin into another

100
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,250
interact from the past apps

101
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,430
it's clear to see that Detective your
beard added additional looking for

102
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:47,160
after every steps of a they are inspired
by this situation during discovery in a

103
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,000
few days

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,860
I take advantage of this for a process
to alter the data which in turn into a

105
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,880
simulators and is this will help out to
determine is it would be nice

106
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:13,590
why this is that hot air do a simulator
is an attack surface for sale of concern

107
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:21,270
first there are different kinds of how
the various emulators with an ally in

108
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,270
kill there are more science

109
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:33,390
30 kilometers and more than 20 and their
service

110
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,080
perhaps it's like this litter connect
casting machine and host machine

111
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:48,090
sir we could animators called inside our
those components memory that I security

112
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,870
code

113
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:59,700
this will lead to really dangerous what
it is before proceeding further let me

114
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,730
go through the difference between going
to be a discovery in her hair

115
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,450
translators and traditional targets

116
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:17,490
let me now make a complete conversion to
explain no more of it is

117
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:24,870
covery inside you label so some of the
very agile a flash and it in vegas or

118
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,230
driver components in kernel space

119
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,270
now what row of it is found in multiple
a target

120
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:40,140
I hardware device and leaders where the
physical device functions like to know

121
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,980
car

122
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,750
I'm interest keyboard computers and so
on a second

123
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,210
testing it seems more particularly in
virtualization fighting for anymore

124
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:00,760
for instance a web page can be used for
are you fighting a remote that Network

125
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:08,080
packets can be used for index so finding
our control function core can be used

126
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,570
for driver of our spelling

127
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,870
however they can even use any of this
theater in hardware us and later reading

128
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:26,500
during the process of developing and
using this feeling that the world we

129
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,580
found more than 120 so great when it is

130
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:39,580
here are the part of city list so that
is for a little bday so they have make

131
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:48,220
palak so I'm considered of is valid for
more cows at if it efficiently and

132
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:59,500
discovering how to where are the
resonators days i'll mention Adam

133
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,520
mentioned about having a used cloud
systems Harley can be seeing as secure

134
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,510
compared to traditional a different
world

135
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,000
virtual machine escape is a new kind of
attack master

136
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,540
according to the attack my sir I design
a set of semi-automatic further remark

137
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:31,180
which realize a boat discovering the day
seen the oscillators organizations it's

138
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,420
a i will start my car girl in the
following part about the operation

139
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,660
principles and incline plantation
details of the only walk

140
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,939
before that you're starting more details
we need to know that as a testing

141
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,850
project for organizing Institute on the
attack surface away focused on is how to

142
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,510
get us leaders we have finished testing
works to several components within

143
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:14,850
Camille and milk station and the found
that if i were security of the place

144
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:23,550
into now the biggest challenges faced is
that is hard to task to the target

145
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:35,339
opponents of the bottom layer then at
NASA's what's the best today for testing

146
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,820
in it out of here

147
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,620
transmitters and forest is a necessary
to analyze later which be sent to the

148
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:55,410
components and there is a process of
generating and transform seconds

149
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,189
sat out the resonator to tagging models

150
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:06,690
according to the devices which could be
at a circuit of machine data flow

151
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,000
they how two ways to contract talented
video

152
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,450
the process our way to outer the content
and other habla de transmisión

153
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,630
committed between the training modules
in kernel space I'd system and hot

154
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:36,540
another way to modifies the initial
state values of those device our

155
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,469
animators

156
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:46,230
well certainly study about devices which
can not be tested erratically and has

157
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,720
ended at about to be determined and the
limited by our modules for more than one

158
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,370
layer

159
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:02,490
at first so recording all of tiny animal
activists which had a very well

160
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:14,220
simulators are doing is tightened at the
first are you male in vail of I those of

161
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:23,819
our today's filing and trust that across
the issues and land out in my eyes are

162
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:38,250
coming from walk by the lock and dollar
percent presented well I start start

163
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:45,210
working on the project i have already
considered the about isn't laterally and

164
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,340
on come

165
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,850
probably for example are utilizing
modular of a to realize several

166
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,790
functions a lot of testing my ring

167
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:05,070
analyzing and they also make sure our
testing framework called the rain middle

168
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,720
relation to the terms like a vmware
workstation cumin and

169
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:18,919
coming the that during what about
development process i'll in exercise our

170
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,229
gas machine operation sits on

171
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:30,229
I'm present to rile later animation
between this story power and manager

172
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:36,200
guess the Machine operation you say
library - or implied Linux driver

173
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,429
commencing casting machine and turn our
God to starting from art for has housing

174
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:51,499
data template story of our enhancing the
calculating they want to make sure that

175
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:52,399
it

176
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:58,879
I an addiction between family from work
and italian dator of the first visit a

177
00:18:58,879 --> 00:18:59,899
target

178
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:05,689
therefore when you to remind our one
month according to the different target

179
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,200
is this about need to consider language
where you to a family environment even

180
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,889
close

181
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:20,988
coding style are developing hardware
device meters for it does for around

182
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:26,749
remember serious serious so there are
two our course on pay more attention to

183
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:35,989
the training conditions will open almost
a generation Walker's a man master for

184
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:41,149
exception handling it natalie is
relating the south of here

185
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:48,859
according to cunha lat strain conditions
are processing devices in later and the

186
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:57,978
Cardinals bears as shown in the figure
you could clear say it

187
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:05,810
: done is there a data flows we r / /
framework into

188
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:15,440
sir powers the host machine to machine
and the control center and hours

189
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,790
the three components are running our
part

190
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:26,030
if I because on mounter line under sore

191
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,830
I power consists of a number of
functional modules

192
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:38,330
so r which is a sorting control center
out of it

193
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:46,100
it contains test case templated database
lot of database and log analysis module

194
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:54,649
plan is in storing water machine client
contains the assets and you later

195
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:02,870
and as modules it on the hook module and
testing data lot model moderate in store

196
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,959
in hope the Machine and they

197
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,850
it contains have either is true meant
module in addition a lot record mother

198
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,850
added communicating module are you every
part

199
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:26,720
let's talk about server the sore
programs are running controlling service

200
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,550
over three programs

201
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:36,350
look see how to magically by controls a
hotel in Paris Isis and translator of

202
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:44,209
every Power steps and security engineers
duty and a lighting results are

203
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,130
and

204
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,160
optima optimized are having data and
models

205
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,800
here are some notable warsi and function

206
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:02,020
points the first one is at some of it is
so we'll course on crash our hood

207
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:09,190
machines that all we need to pay
attention to timeout happen and

208
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:16,810
recovering the heading environment of
formation which machine penalty and the

209
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:23,050
the last of I is the that meant finding
and tagging data and really had a lot of

210
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,050
seen higher

211
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:40,120
this models of the work of the following
followings of seconds at the beginning

212
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:48,399
of something our network and a half of
airmen environment long server klein and

213
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,390
the motor

214
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,710
after that planetvale r sitten hook
module

215
00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:01,000
I got all of the device emulators basic
information that flying blind of your

216
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,660
ass server for testing data of emulators

217
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,770
so we will send out the required dinner

218
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:17,830
flying is saved and a lot of the titans
are the long test at the same time

219
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:24,909
montorio can't continually chatted or
have other working and direct record

220
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:38,500
down locks after bow steps that starting
line finish and Klein will notify the

221
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,730
summer and server rail

222
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:49,930
collapse from Klein and water sales are
into the base that serve your lunch

223
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:58,210
logging out and Ally module to tell me
if anything wrong happened and notify

224
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,600
the security engineer and then and then
security engineer

225
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,959
we're under lied program exceptions
optimize our final mark

226
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:23,120
client for on program is running in the
Machine and the men function of this

227
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,449
program it to get out of a relation
component information

228
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:36,170
the operation principal Klein is
emulating the device manager of windows

229
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,890
and index of the rated information our
hardware

230
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:48,470
I'm really diverse managers including to
us last night

231
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,740
says bowl football memories and parts
all this information are determined by

232
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,360
eyes drawn module

233
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,570
well that's the machining operation
system started and the year linux listen

234
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:11,210
for are storing house and we can use the
spc a command to get

235
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,470
however other are several levels order
of the house of your device emulators

236
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:24,080
will call only says our top level into a
awesome manager

237
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:40,600
incline forgot we'll use a testator from
our canoes and our elevator continuous

238
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,299
assassin entry officer technical
components received later starter and

239
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:52,990
restrictions that firm is opponent to
filled out data structure

240
00:25:53,590 --> 00:26:01,689
first a target the components received a
blow from which machine through our part

241
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,910
and I'll memory

242
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:10,360
sega different target component fit
different state structures and later

243
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:18,100
I do and allied two kinds of network car
which are you one solvent and it's not

244
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,980
it's clear to sail a difference in the
world car that data structure are

245
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:31,660
totally different service inc cans of
holidays metres relay similar roles in

246
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,309
different machine

247
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:39,610
meanwhile our field restrictions out
their structure in there and kill me are

248
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,240
different

249
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,160
we need to define to size of limited
Ranger our for a related

250
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,900
sending out captain Taylor - in target
components a-rod already similar process

251
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:08,140
the first step is that a user layer of
line and generated has ended her since

252
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,800
right quest to climb or not according to
a specified operations from data

253
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:21,550
the second step is at Cline Colonel
applies for memory according to the

254
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:30,220
request fill our memory and the sins of
memory information to specified parts

255
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:39,220
and we can say the main functions of
client program are getting target ponens

256
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,410
generating tagging their scenting tell
you later

257
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:50,470
additionally our sense of loss to server
out controlling centering time

258
00:27:52,990 --> 00:28:00,970
now let's load to a monitoring helps
machine motor program realized function

259
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:07,840
inside follows before the while managing
virtual machines like as a natural

260
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,850
environment power measurement of the gas
machine features a moment and our future

261
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:21,760
machines a sign of our time to make lady
backing the running precise our guest

262
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,840
Machine such as backing our launching
cast and wishing landing the debugging

263
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:38,770
secrets record dividing info sort of a
lot are capping keeping a record of Gaza

264
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:45,190
machines running precise include
recording running process of for user

265
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:55,060
layer and drum module of kernel space
there are other things monitor will to

266
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,740
hear when touching , way

267
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,309
can set up custom machine how to do a
simulators by modify some of their

268
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:12,780
permits and they can modify the cumulus
those codes for recording the precise

269
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,370
are when targeting members oxidation we
can we got manager which one machine

270
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:27,059
how to wear device by modifying
configurations house as a debugging

271
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:33,178
masterly that you've been the part
program to large men process our former

272
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:40,200
decision and there's a lot of the best
to bargain script for recording running

273
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
process of virtual machines

274
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,240
as a symbol cost three responses are
cutting machine a rating system crash

275
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,409
which lies in system crash and
incredible results

276
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:06,029
gasps the machinery in system crash
happens are then there is shoes in our

277
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:13,740
modules because of the system adoption
issue and this hour we'll have us a lot

278
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,850
we pay more attention to gasma she's
crash and available results

279
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:31,020
the only way we'll find our bdays by and
lightens up for gas machine system crash

280
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:38,190
it's more of a various to be detected
and the it's often castle by serious

281
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:45,690
entities which are trickling in a movie
is to turn which is it on such i'll have

282
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:54,809
overflow double free or you after three
and sore and you need about the last

283
00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:05,158
only can be recorded by the lighting
Gaston locks and monitor program we need

284
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,750
to you the last bagging skills to help

285
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,679
so pretty Engineers that's fine new
security issues

286
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:21,240
autumn automatically recording details
of our order machine running it

287
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,580
sparingly changes our key values and
it's really necessary

288
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:34,830
this on the record make a automated
visor there you this information package

289
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:39,779
or other larger communities are some
other babies

290
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:46,950
the instrument 10 and technics very best
all before their units in bowling

291
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:53,399
information or so coldians its own
weight asked as were some of the year

292
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:56,159
without so-called awesome

293
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:03,360
involving the information like kurta
like the one workstation where uh adopt

294
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,610
another a master to implement his
termination

295
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:15,510
technics and the first of may reverse
the top of your information a location

296
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:25,350
the Kotel and variables that means are
very important to critic . when writing

297
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,219
the balance

298
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,220
super on developing plugins

299
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,620
at the beginning when they are you

300
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,959
this preamble way god Manny crashes are
you shot

301
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:51,490
however after taking out relatively
simple and abilities have a corner find

302
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:58,510
with more complex issues at that time
was thought of that opinion to out by

303
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:05,620
the falling from work because of our
master a virtualization rupees discovery

304
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:14,199
by falling heavily really on accuracy
and diversity of testing in those and a

305
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,490
being most of kisses every once and that
was a office in those candidates to it

306
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:28,990
with each other so we may need national
symbols and interesting results are in

307
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:36,130
detail to up to my testing desert
generators is Beverly the courage up

308
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:45,850
area of the target called recording more
locks and is attacking record can help

309
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:54,789
how us outta my the testing data power
and lighting the aligned client lost way

310
00:33:54,789 --> 00:34:00,220
cool decreased invalid combination

311
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:08,560
during the testing data generation by
analyzing several of the writing server

312
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:15,609
lost guising gathering and analyzing
testing per meter and the crash

313
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:19,719
parameters of who outed templates

314
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:32,480
and higher are uh I need to know that
the danger of however do a simulator

315
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,260
whatever it is say that are limited
person process of memory permission

316
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:47,899
house to do determine the effect of our
ability fluoridation in the permission

317
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:55,098
without permission not not not more
money you have blockage operation can be

318
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,030
deployed

319
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:06,020
then they may need permission escalation
or by using i will be this and it causes

320
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,330
that this setting for that

321
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:14,839
who will focus on testing more can
double with violation systems in the

322
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:15,529
future

323
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:23,510
I said I the help of a and remember are
they also add more tax services of

324
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,510
adding fractions

325
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,689
Lori different depending modules how
being added in the outliner family from

326
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,430
work for example have a core and all
that

327
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:43,160
well how core and the customer she
client we do that

328
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,250
the framework will have us fine law for
gays in the future

329
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:56,510
and then the final walk and curry basis

330
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:02,839
a little is it on a surface and the
matching member can use this little wall

331
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,070
and find more than fifty one of these
days i'll make the offer and what become

332
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,070
our source protect

333
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:22,109
and now i will show you too kisses about
hardware and resonators working on

334
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:30,060
working and one of these days with
living that this two components and

335
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:39,330
realize functions of another world car
like a mission before the packet in

336
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,029
casting machine get into host machine

337
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:48,450
the access internet through host of
physical network are by happening was a

338
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,450
this network our emulator

339
00:36:51,450 --> 00:37:00,868
now that pay attention to the operating
operating principle of our cable car

340
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:10,440
simulator in the word play the other in
system selects cross pounding driver

341
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:18,990
according to the type of metal car when
it starts that traverse available to

342
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:25,618
distribute our cars our memory drives
the initial I and device stator and

343
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,790
allocating memory resources for
descriptor table after the operation

344
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:41,880
system at Starrcade rouse the better is
Kingston on the network network packet

345
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,359
avail

346
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:51,569
enter into device driver components of
the word a driver driver driver gone and

347
00:37:51,570 --> 00:38:00,089
civilians or later into the descriptor
and solidity register of network are to

348
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:00,900
be true

349
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:10,440
learn maybe another car and it has that
ability records to helping with the side

350
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,660
and the interval precise the

351
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:21,848
described her table the answer is our
steps of four described herein described

352
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,170
their table

353
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:30,849
well there are catastrophe described her
out it is governor and legacy described

354
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:31,450
her

355
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,200
according to the disc writer location
and content pretend at a table in our

356
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:48,250
car will attract as a natural card info
and assassinated to church with us

357
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:56,349
adapter after which the facility
regulator will be silent Forest and

358
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:01,329
after that i holded packet transmission
process finish

359
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:07,510
there are two pawns we need to fit
putting into here

360
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:16,420
the first why is that the descriptor
that to color is one of the the out of

361
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:26,559
the ring like memory printed side is a
success in the less out it's got a table

362
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,450
and it will be or return from the
beginning officer described the table

363
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,640
just this reason proper work for lower
wheel are not a talker

364
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:45,250
this and why is that - the banana or car
use TV segment of a lot of technique to

365
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:54,520
in Peru passing rid of nano packet good
is a complete kit and complicated logic

366
00:39:55,029 --> 00:40:02,049
are there may be because this will be a
seems all called a little car simulator

367
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:06,520
which is related to this technic

368
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:18,680
and found two or three days I mean of
this house ever more about housing

369
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,990
headings are debating our car

370
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:33,470
I'm later at - - and then rock station
as it to are in similar principle a very

371
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:43,910
able to control the colonel component of
custom machine suburban system hydrating

372
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:49,040
of the court of law is a possible by
setting several variables sub-code

373
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:02,480
the second second component is peace in
that Network our emulator

374
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:09,799
although they live in that building due
to its described there are totally

375
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:16,700
different from us other than network
card but they are doing similar things

376
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,980
like doing well

377
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,630
later packing for than since this simple
to put a layer adapter from for a

378
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:35,360
further steps in terms of Earth ask
below to of folks in a true as this

379
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,280
figure

380
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:46,310
I mean I mean of writing cause he's a
narc mornin's capture the operation are

381
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,460
writing control and so there's the
register

382
00:41:51,290 --> 00:42:00,470
yeah it will get into the function we
got for doing with data plan for that a

383
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:05,029
component of a all separate separate
little late getting to process our for

384
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:14,150
sending and receiving the decade during
the whole process is interesting

385
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:24,650
the detail is that adding a CR say after
dinner case and the phone one or

386
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,730
availability

387
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:34,370
instyler code option adding laser
received data pack aid attackers through

388
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,370
the cost and upper awful over there

389
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:47,629
contracting described her and was
deciding is that we could overflow the

390
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:55,970
contracted to her to function pointer
hunters and this will make 19 customer

391
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,970
cheesecake attack personal

392
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:13,689
and to that discuss about the virtual
addresses on filing from of eating by my

393
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:19,690
team and the video can continue to
working on this planet from wall to make

394
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:29,650
it more division and god I hope my sweet
will bring your new some new sauce and

395
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:38,440
the place to turn for our margin months
in reliance its own security file since

396
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,770
for parent listening and welcome to
control me

397
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,770
so the value meal

398
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,950
Thank using how are there any questions

399
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:05,350
yes hello you're talking about up normal
functions if you get the locking back

400
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,640
from the client

401
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:18,339
how do you get it is a panama has makes
a decline and what do you get

402
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:25,180
testing results and you are shown in the
slide that you get abnormal results

403
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,370
how do we get there that is an adenoma
result

404
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,330
what is the difference because a between
normal and abnormal

405
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,020
normal and what an enema

406
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,880
I optimal abnormal Obama already log of
them

407
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,550
let the nothin

408
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:57,880
normal our server and domino server then
behavior of their client be on the movie

409
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,840
you can send an email has him after the
currency other questions

410
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,840
yeah in the back

411
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:18,828
hello I was close to know how efficient
it is to do some amazing on you

412
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:24,440
ems because I can sense when you have
crasher to mr. the snapshot all reruns a

413
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,750
vm so excuse and all fast applause oh
sorry

414
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,890
here come here more evil

415
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:42,770
that's all I can speak a mountain so I
was asking to know how efficient it was

416
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:47,960
to have a thousand framework on vm
because I can sense if you have a crush

417
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,150
on you vm you detect abnormal behavior
or whatever and then you have to restore

418
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:57,500
the snapshot or we start the VMA for
every piece of that are you finding it

419
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:11,420
so how fast it is how how what it was
for friday sorry how long hard hot

420
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:23,210
I four different / bit a of the time in
a different so I i can't say how hung

421
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:37,780
about the the fasting logic you started
with the fasting logic at the base and

422
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,820
how do you get more or a better fasting
logic data

423
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:54,759
you understand so you have a base
fasting logic you started with filing

424
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,400
what you told us about that the view is
starting the faster

425
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:08,050
yeah and you have to get in the base
data processing files for this later

426
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:14,050
yeah and next run you do it you get
another passing data better than the

427
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,980
first one

428
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:25,270
how do we get that maybe it has
something in your eye and tell you more

429
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:42,080
I 16 Chinese 043 try to share content
when he know you could you sure either

430
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,660
no more shall we huh of an arm motion we
need some more lights event that you may

431
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,370
wish you to open or motion with
beautiful

432
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,790
we are open on collateral dokie on me
with a crash program

433
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,270
yeah yeah

434
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:16,250
mm you into a knot m3 a certain cat so
we cannot go before that the first lie

435
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:22,970
is a a machine last crash or I was gonna
use that I have rather crash and the

436
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,310
someone I coid i call it the you
available results

437
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:39,140
uh yeah i used the second one the second
one behavior in the early uh there are

438
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,240
some serious one of the days

439
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:50,750
can I can make that happen rather crash
and II you might be in my house I find

440
00:48:50,750 --> 00:49:01,580
the you half and debris or other series
of days on this pick up and for the star

441
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:07,430
of our third finger where I finds are in
for a decade

442
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:15,890
people like it how you want it ok that
the second

443
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,670
oh man she wanted the

444
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,310
show you to your room haha you man
beautiful

445
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,210
- yeah actually below . from man - sure

446
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:34,680
