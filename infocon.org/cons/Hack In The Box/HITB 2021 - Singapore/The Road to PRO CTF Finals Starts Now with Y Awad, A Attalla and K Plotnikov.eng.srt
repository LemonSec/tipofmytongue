4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
said like hey you guys are not doing

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,440

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
we'll talk a little bit about the

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,599
road to ctf finals

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
so in the studio with me uh we have

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
yusef award who actually participated in

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
cboe in 2019

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,840
and uh over in the top left hand screen

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
you'll see constantine and the guys from

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
hackadorm what's up bro

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,520
thanks for joining us guys i know the

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
game is going to start like any time

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
soon like i i don't know what time it is

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
there but i i'm guessing

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,719
seven minutes ago

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,399
seven minutes to start okay so we won't

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,160
take much time then we got 15 minutes on

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
the clock here so i'll try and get this

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,480
done in seven minutes uh

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
firstly uh tell us a little bit more

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,360
about like the the ctf like so the ctf

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
that you guys have organized right like

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,160
it's a collaborative effort between

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
hanging the box between hackerdom

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
between ctf.ae

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
maybe you guys want to talk about like a

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,559
little bit about what happened in the

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,080
last couple of weeks or the last you

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
know in the run-up to this contest that

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,960
we're gonna run in seven

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
so it's minutes a free qualification for

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
students and maybe also pupils for like

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,799
for educational teams

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
uh top uh like

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,320
10 maybe so it depends on you actually i

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,600
think top 10

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
will go to first year in november

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
through abu dhabi

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,320
and

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
guys from cfa

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,119
they

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,240
organized

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
their training session two weeks ago

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
for jinx who have ever played attack and

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
defensively who played only job artists

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
here when you just get tasks you sold

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
them you

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
send the answers and get your points

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,960
here in attacking defense here

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,119
everything is different so teams play

54
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
against each other so it's like real

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
people not just challengers so they can

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,320
use any advanced tricks to protect their

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
servers their services and to exploit

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
their final business

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,479
so it's actually well a bit different

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
though totally different from japanese

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,040
yeah basically japanese ctf is like a

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
game right and like attacking the rest

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,359
is real

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,040
and uh maybe joseph can

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
tell us more about the training because

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
it was like two weeks ago so logically

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
yeah uh thank you so uh thanks to the

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
hard work by the guys at uh hacker dawg

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
we were able to

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,000
make two days of the training so

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
as constantine already said you're

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,959
really able to rank people who maybe

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
didn't have enough knowledge about

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
attack and defense and really give them

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,760
in-depth hands-on training for two days

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
about what attack and defense is all

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
about

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
and they got their hands dirty with

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
exploiting defending and really got a

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,319
feel of how the real game is going to be

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
although i think the pressure is much

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
different when you're actually trying to

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
qualify for a professional ctf

84
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
but yeah we had a blast interacting with

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
the players really talented teams were

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
present at the training so it was all in

87
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
all a great experience so i mean the

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
training that you guys did like two

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
weeks ago right uh it's it stems from

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
the journey that you guys did in 2019 as

91
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
cboe right and then kind of like i'm

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,040
guessing it's a bit of the learnings

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
that you guys had back then and kind of

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,280
adapted to 2021 or or what was the

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
training about

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah definitely so i would say that some

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
of the things we experienced in cboe

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
2019 uh especially how initially we felt

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,400
loss

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
like lost as a team who'd never played

101
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,319
attack in defense we definitely took

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,640
some of that experience and really

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,879
understood what it's like to be

104
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,319
playing attack and defense for the first

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,360
time

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
and tried our absolute best to fill up

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,080
all the gaps so that they're just as

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
prepared as a team who's been playing

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,159
attack and defense for a couple of years

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,319
so yeah we just wanted to make it like

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,200
give everybody an even playing field so

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,799
they feel qualified for this sort of

113
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,159
competition

114
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,760
and i mean i'm looking at the team list

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
there's like 120 122 teams from around

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,040
the world uh in terms of like skill sets

117
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,399
right i mean when you're you're trying

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
to train teams up student teams that

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,440
have never played attack defense like

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
how do you give them a crash course

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
in in a short period of time to get them

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,240
ready i mean what's the what's the game

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,720
plan for that man

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
i mean we had a lot of uh cooperation

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,960
with the great guys at hackerdom they

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
gave us a lot of tips of what the

127
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
players should know and i think without

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
them we wouldn't have been able to give

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
the training that we were able to you

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
know give the quality but i think it was

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,160
all about

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
trying to condense the most important

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
things into two days and the most

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
important part was the hands-on

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
experience you can't just talk for hours

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,199
and hours at a time it's never going to

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,800
stick so

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
they were able to actually apply what we

139
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
were teaching them

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,479
right then and there in the training and

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
attack other teams as well during the

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,479
training so i think the whole hands-on

143
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,320
experience being able to see the

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
machines see the network see how the

145
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,039
game works right during the training

146
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,440
really help the knowledge stick and help

147
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,600
them even learn new things

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,160
that i might have not said explicitly

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
during the training

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
so in terms of the teams that have

151
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
signed up right

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
um do you guys have any crowd favorites

153
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
i mean i i do i have a crowd favorite

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
i'm looking through the list i'm like

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
yeah these guys are gonna win like but

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
on you on your end like do you guys have

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
any kind of like uh

158
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
insights into what do you think is going

159
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
to happen

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,919
some teams which we

161
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
uh waited for for many years for example

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,680
saviors from outstanding first

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
team

164
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
yeah but also uh teams from other

165
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,479
countries and this

166
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
year a lot of uh asian teams are joining

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
us and it's great that cpf becomes

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
popular really around the globe

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840
uh so i've never seen her previously so

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,160
many things from

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
uh

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
yeah i was quite impressed as well i

173
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
mean the the list of teams is very

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
diverse as in we got teams from mexico

175
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
from vietnam obviously there's a lot of

176
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
teams now i'm from russia

177
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,199
uh and germany uk

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
and the the diversity is is quite

179
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
significant um

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,080
it's quite exciting to to see that

181
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,479
happen but um for for the guys that are

182
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,680
actually going to be playing this game

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
right like we're only going to be able

184
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
to fly the top three winners over right

185
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
so what happens to the rest as in like

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
four five six seven

187
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,280
what happens to those guys

188
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
yeah we would like to have finals in

189
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,919
hybrid format so parts of teams uh

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
target teams can join uh online so

191
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
the top three teams as you said will

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
apply to

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
but the rest like five or seven

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,479
uh top teams can join us

195
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,440
virtually and played the same network as

196
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
all before

197
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
so hang on a second you guys are saying

198
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
that the pro ctf finals that are going

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
to be happening at cyber week is going

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,080
to be a hybridized game so the the teams

201
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,560
that are flying down in person and the

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,039
teams that are playing it online are

203
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
essentially in the same environment is

204
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
that correct yeah yeah totally they're

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
playing against each other in the very

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
same network with the same set of

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,199
services

208
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
and they'll exploit each other that's

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
cool man so would you say that this is

210
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
like kind of like the i mean i'm going

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
to do air quotes right like first

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
cyber night ctf or you know is this

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
something that has been done before i

214
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
mean what's the deal because as far as i

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
know ctf has always been you either fly

216
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,639
there and you play

217
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,199
or you you don't play

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,800
yeah i think i think

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,759
it helped helped us yeah

220
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,319
and that's why this year hybrid format

221
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
becomes popular if i'm not mistaken uh

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,160
i'm not sure but maybe at death corner

223
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
in the united states they also try to

224
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,879
use type informant but i'm not sure

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,360
maybe we need to check but well

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
i think this is this is uh year

227
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,520
2k21 well

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
we can't do anything but playing hybrid

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
so so basically defcon tried it but

230
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
hackerdom will do it better

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
no pressure no pressure but

232
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
i mean i'm super excited because uh

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
this is kind of like one of the

234
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
the rare opportunities that student

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
teams actually get to play with with uh

236
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
with the pro guys so do you think that

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,160
the this pre-qualifier that we do

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,519
will be sufficient to give them enough

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
knowledge and enough kind of like you

240
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
know experience

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
that when they come to cyber week in in

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,839
november that they don't you know get

243
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,360
whooped basically

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
and become you know just a team that

245
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
people the other pro teams are just

246
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
gonna kind of like you know get all the

247
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
points from them uh do you think that

248
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
that this game will be will be

249
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
sufficient for them to kind of gain the

250
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
experience they need

251
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
i think i think at least

252
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
maybe one or two

253
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
uh eu teams well

254
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,440
they can be can be cool enough and

255
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
leading up to combat

256
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
proteins and uh

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
being maybe one

258
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
maybe not the first but like top three

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,120
or top five so

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
i would say that

261
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
edu teams are quite enthusiastic and

262
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
they have a lot of free time because

263
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,920
they are studying and in summer they are

264
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
free and they can spend like maybe not

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,279
24 but like 16 hours training and

266
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
educating so and they are very motivated

267
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
so yeah i think they are

268
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
very serious

269
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
so those who will qualify they would

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,680
determine

271
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,959
awesome man

272
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
uh so any favorites you guys want to

273
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
pick a winner now like you wanna you

274
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
wanna make some bets i have my bet i

275
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,560
think red rocket is gonna win man

276
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
you remember them from

277
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,079
almost 19 yeah yeah no kidding

278
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
yeah i remember them flying to the top

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
like in the last day yeah exactly so uh

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
for the guys watching at home who who

281
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,200
might not be aware of what happened in

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
the past right red rocket well pretty

283
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
much one of the the finalists teams in

284
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,720
the pro ctf in 2019

285
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
uh somehow another they decided to join

286
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
this pre-qualifier even though they

287
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
don't really need to because basically

288
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
we would have invited all of them anyway

289
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,200
uh as part of the finalists in 2019 but

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
they decided to join uh giving a lot of

291
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
stress against the other teams

292
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
no pressure guys no pressure but like

293
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
look out for the red rocket man because

294
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
my money is on them man like definitely

295
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,480
i think redrock is going to walk away

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
with it

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
i would i would not say my bet

298
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,800
you said yourself who do you think my

299
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
new team which one do you think is gonna

300
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,959
gonna come out on top man

301
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,000
uh i'm rooting actually for the team uh

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
my team that i used to be a part of what

303
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
i'm still a part of but you know we're

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
not edu anymore uh output doors so i'm

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
hoping the guys could learn uh from our

306
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
lessons back in 2019 and uh hopefully

307
