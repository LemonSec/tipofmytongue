1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,080
we've got a session right now with the

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
guys from orange cyber defense and

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,040
suppose

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,519
i think ulrich is online

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,440
rick are you there bro

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,720

how are you guys we're doing all right

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
man how are you man

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,960
yeah it's not so quite early morning

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
anymore

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
that's good that's good what time is it

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,519
there anyway like nine something or 10

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,400
o'clock in the morning something like

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,439
that

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,960
yeah 9 30

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,239
that's not too bad

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,160
not too early not too early not too

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,760
early how's things been man how's how's

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,200
the team how is everybody doing over

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
there

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
yeah i think really good um obviously

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,879
given covert and everything it's been

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,920
quite an interesting uh 18 months or so

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
especially from the fan testing side

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
well it's been been a bit of a changing

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,719
thing um obviously everybody

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,039
testing remotely now these days training

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
is remote everything's gone remote so um

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,800
yeah but we're all doing good i think we

30
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,438
as a team has have adjusted quite well

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,960
um to all the different use cases and

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,280
in general the team has grown um

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
obviously us becoming part of our orange

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,799
side defense

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
um so we've got a lot more talent a lot

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
more people to work alongside us so no

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
really been doing good and there

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
how's the uh

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,720
how's the team now i mean how many

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,680
people are you guys i mean at the moment

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,640
so

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
i don't have an accurate number for you

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
but um we

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
so the same space team we're about about

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,360
40 people

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
um but we obviously as part of the

47
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
orange cyber defense group we've got

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
representation in more or less every

49
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,880
european country

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
as well as in the rest of the world so

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,040
our technical teams has quite

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
significantly increased and with the

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
addition of more of the defense side of

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,000
things

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,920
we've got teams and socks we've got

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
teams as part of search teams research

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,119
teams

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
so it's uh it's been quite an expansion

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
and quite a journey for us to

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
to get our hands on more research and

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
more interesting things to play with

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,520
hey you're mentioning about training

63
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,679
just a while ago right like uh

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
if i'm not i didn't misunderstand i

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,959
think you guys are supposed to be doing

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,480
a course at cyber week right like in

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
november coming up right

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,959
yeah we're doing three courses at cyber

69
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
week um we tried to actually do it uh or

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
arrange for it to be physical and it

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
seems that uh unfortunately south africa

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
being at the bottom end of the world

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
we're still on the bad list

74
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
um so we might not be able to travel

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
anymore

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
um but yeah we're definitely doing three

77
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
courses with you guys at uh cyber week

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
um a bit of our introduction to hacking

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
course and uh representing our wi-fi

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
course as well as our web application

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
active course so quite excited about

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,640
that

83
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,720
so i mean okay i mean we're hoping that

84
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
obviously by november things will be

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,599
different and you guys will be able to

86
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,200
travel but i mean for the folks that are

87
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
not maybe you know concerned about uh

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
coming in person uh they'll probably be

89
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,920
able to join this training remotely

90
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
right but what have you guys done to

91
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
kind of cater to those folks right

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
because you know learning at home

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
watching talks on the zoom kind of sucks

94
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
right

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,319
yeah i think

96
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,560
it definitely was and it also sucks for

97
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
the trainers to be honest um one of the

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
big issues that we've experienced over

99
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,040
the past year and a half has been the

100
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
whole concept of training to the void um

101
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
so you'll sit in front of your screen

102
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
it's a black screen nobody wants to turn

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
on their cameras i don't know maybe feel

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
that they might be judged for being in

105
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
the pajamas or anything

106
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
but it's been it's been quite a quite a

107
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
tough thing to to manage so to try and

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,400
keep user engagement uh really keep it

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
up and have people

110
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
engage and properly um

111
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
interact with the course

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
so the way that we try to counter this

113
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
is is really to try and realign our

114
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,360
courses to be a little bit more

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
interactive so asking a lot more

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
questions putting people not on the spot

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
but um allowing them to to interact

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
directly with the trainers

119
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
we also rely on stuff like this called

120
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,040
purely just

121
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
one-on-one conversations or doing

122
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
different polls to try and get people to

123
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
actually interact with the trainers at

124
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
the end of the day

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
um but yeah it's been a tough journey

126
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,439
for those which due to virtual training

127
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
we've been blessed in the fact that um

128
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
at least from an infrastructure

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
perspective our training obviously we've

130
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,918
been training for for about 20 years um

131
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,199
be pretty my time obviously

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
but with that some of my predecessors

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,680
have built quite solid solutions in on

134
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
cloud-based uh

135
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,800
training platforms

136
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
so which means when everything needed to

137
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
switch virtual we didn't really have a

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
big problem um so everything was

139
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
literally just let's add zoom and add

140
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
discord as an additional solution to

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
this but everything is still

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,880
over the browser um literally got

143
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,800
hacking labs everything from from that

144
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,919
perspective

145
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,440
so it's been quite a

146
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
interesting journey for us to to make

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
the shift to to virtual but with the

148
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,759
addition of stuff like this for um and

149
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,000
more direct user engagement

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
it's been quite well um our training has

151
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
been doing good we've been

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
still getting good reviews and

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
everything from all the students so

154
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
hopefully we still you're still making a

155
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,800
difference out there how are you running

156
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
the wi-fi hacking courses or over the

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
internet like over the cloud

158
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
so it's actually very interesting um

159
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
dominic white to singe as you guys would

160
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,400
know him

161
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,199
a few years ago he he's obviously very

162
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
much into the wifi acting scene

163
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
um and he decided to build

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
wi-fi labs um in the cloud so utilizing

165
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,759
a few docker images um along with other

166
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,080
technologies that exist uh he managed to

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
set up a virtual

168
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
wi-fi lab um utilizing uh

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
like infrastructure as code network

170
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
cards

171
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
um allowing that to send traffic and

172
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,759
then we just pre-programmed traffic

173
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,400
within the networks so to simulate it

174
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
so obviously your signal strength within

175
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,000
the wi-fi labs are extremely great which

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,840
is not exactly how it would have been in

177
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
the real world scenario but it's uh it's

178
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
still there and it still allows us to

179
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
teach the the wifi hacking stuff all

180
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,560
through our browser literally terminal

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
in the browser still set up your network

182
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
cards and and go ahead and actually hack

183
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
everything it's pretty interesting

184
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
do you think that you know with like now

185
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
that everybody is kind of staying at

186
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
home right like keeping the audience

187
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,000
attention and making sure they're

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
actually following along right it's

189
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
pretty hard i mean if you're sitting in

190
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
a classroom i can physically see if

191
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,440
you're not paying attention or if you're

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
not you're not physically sitting there

193
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,319
right but as you just mentioned most

194
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
folks have their cameras turned off

195
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
uh how do you know that they're you're

196
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
actually still presenting to them and

197
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
they haven't just like you know gonna

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,160
walk the dog or something you know

199
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,880
well

200
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
it's definitely a it's definitely a

201
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
tough thing um the best way we do it is

202
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
to obviously try and

203
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,599
have them be engaged with with us either

204
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,800
through discord chats then or through um

205
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,360
literally potentially even monitoring of

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
um like more of a gamified style so

207
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
that's one of the big big changes that

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,840
we're trying to make for for future

209
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
trainings is to bring in the idea of a

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
ctf which is a standard thing in the

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
industry but to bring that into the

212
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
actual training for for trainers to see

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
well where are people how are they

214
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,759
tracking um how are they doing are they

215
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
actually with us or not so currently

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,720
we're doing this by polls and uh various

217
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
means for them to indicate where they

218
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
are and how they're progressing um but

219
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
it but there is still potentially the

220
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
real opportunity for people to

221
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
join the training uh leave their screen

222
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
up and go and play some xbox or

223
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
something in the background and we won't

224
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
really know if that if that's the case

225
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
but we really do hope that the people

226
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,639
who join the training are actually

227
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
actually with us

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
um but i think that that talks to a very

229
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
different point at the end of the day um

230
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
we've seen quite a change in the nature

231
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,319
of the the people that we do train

232
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
so in the past it was a lot more around

233
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
the curiosity so people will join any

234
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,720
course potentially just because they

235
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
have a slight interest in a specific

236
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,639
technology or in a specific problem

237
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
within the spiritual industry

238
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,039
um but more of late obviously since

239
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
covert and people

240
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,879
from organizational perspective budget

241
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,160
cuts and all these things the people

242
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
that actually join the forces are more

243
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,879
of a i want to say purest um in quotes

244
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
this is not a

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
legit term but i think

246
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,599
the people that actually join our

247
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
trainees um these days are really

248
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
actually interested in learning this

249
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
learning this stuff and and really

250
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,360
taking away the poor poor takeaways from

251
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,400
the courses

252
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
which is really cool because we get

253
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
challenged quite a lot on the trainings

254
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,599
to answer more specific questions and

255
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
deep dive more into the technologies

256
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
itself

257
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
but hopefully that also results in in

258
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
better quality training at the end of

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
the day

260
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,880
i mean i think one of the main questions

261
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
that we always get asked as organizers

262
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
right especially from the folks that are

263
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
paying for the training so the

264
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,200
organizations that are actually like you

265
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
know paying for their guys to go is how

266
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
do we ensure that they're actually

267
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
attending you know and they're actually

268
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
learning stuff right so i mean

269
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
checkpoints and stuff uh you know and

270
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
questions that you can give them are one

271
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
way but i think gamification is really

272
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
the future because there's no better way

273
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
to test right than actually giving you a

274
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,399
real life example

275
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
yeah no definitely i think the the idea

276
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
of having people go through the process

277
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
of understanding something then

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
verifying that they understand it either

279
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
with a questionnaire maybe a flag or

280
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
something that they can submit um i

281
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
think really that's the future for

282
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
people to be engaged throughout the

283
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
training session

284
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
um it is a bit harder when it's uh

285
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
instructor-led training so i think

286
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,959
that's where the future of and what

287
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,560
we've seen in the industry currently is

288
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,279
is the major shift to more um self

289
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,120
self-based training courses or

290
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
self-module courses where you you get a

291
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,920
short module and we all have busy lives

292
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
these days so setting it potentially in

293
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
a two-day four-day course isn't

294
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,680
necessarily the best option for people

295
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
since working hours has also shifted

296
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
so the idea of switching more towards

297
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,360
like a is a short module on

298
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
for example

299
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
wi-fi specifically but it's a subsection

300
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,839
of that and we'll only teach this once

301
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
one module and allowing people to do

302
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
that on the self-paced uh basis where

303
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
they can guide their own progress i

304
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
think that's the the future we're moving

305
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
to and we're seeing this across the

306
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
industry with various competitors um and

307
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,480
organizations releasing new new

308
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
trainings like this

309
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
um but it's definitely something that we

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
also keen on on going after um so watch

311
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
this space

312
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
in quotes um we are working on some

313
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,160
interesting things on our end but yeah i

314
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
think definitely the idea of keeping

315
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
people engaged and having them

316
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
apply the knowledge that they've

317
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
learned from something theoretical

318
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
has been our practice

319
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
however um the idea of having hands-on

320
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
labs hands-on things that you can

321
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
actually do getting your hands dirty

322
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
handling the keyboard that's the core

323
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
idea of of the sainsbury's trainings at

324
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
least um best way to learn something is

325
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
to to get good get into it get in there

326
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
and and

327
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,560
figure it out

328
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,880
and eventually overcome the challenges

329
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
do you guys uh in your opinion right are

330
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
you worried that the industry as a whole

331
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
has changed so dramatically like the way

332
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,800
that we consume knowledge now right i

333
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,560
mean like well we're on zoom right now

334
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
and you know we have like people around

335
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
the world kind of watching the stream

336
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
similarly for trainings as well people

337
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
as you mentioned they have a busy life

338
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,839
you know they tune in when they want

339
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,440
they want it on demand it's like that

340
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
netflix generation right i got five

341
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,959
minutes i want to learn something you

342
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
know do you think that

343
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
in 2022 2023 even when we go back to

344
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
quote unquote normal

345
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
it's not going to be the same simply

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,079
because you know people expect a

347
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,079
different style of delivery right of

348
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,519
content of learning as in a different

349
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
form do you think that's so

350
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
yeah i definitely think so i think the

351
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,279
everything evolves at the end of the day

352
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,959
so i think the big thing is we need to

353
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,480
adjust with it so from a training

354
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
perspective um obviously it's one of our

355
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,920
key focuses as an organization is to

356
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,880
share knowledge and to to educate others

357
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
and share the knowledge that we gain

358
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
through through active engagement with

359
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,120
our clients

360
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,880
but um yeah i definitely think the

361
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
delivery method of that is is on the

362
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
change and i don't think it's gonna ever

363
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
stop changing i think for now the next

364
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,440
big best thing is that the on demand

365
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
culture like you're saying and i think

366
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
the the culture shift within the

367
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,240
training industry not just in security

368
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
training i think in general all training

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,519
these days people want a short

370
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,040
five-minute thing that can learn them

371
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
something quick and easy

372
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
um the big problem with with the with

373
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
the on-demand culture at the end of the

374
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,279
day is one can potentially learn

375
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,200
something very quickly but you might not

376
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
understand the poor fundamentals behind

377
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
something so

378
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
getting back to the roots of slowly

379
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,399
ensuring that even if you produce a 10

380
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,040
minute video teaching somebody something

381
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,680
it's to still allow them the resources

382
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,639
and accessibility to other forms of

383
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
information so that they can still

384
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,160
solidify their knowledge around it and

385
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,680
actually still go and practice and test

386
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,519
these things so that it is actually

387
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,160
usable in the real world environments

388
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
what about justification i mean like the

389
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
cost of the trainings are still high

390
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
right i mean even though you're learning

391
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,519
it from home uh when we first pivoted i

392
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,639
mean due to covet right we did

393
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,839
everything online we tried to bring the

394
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,440
pricing down as in to try and make it a

395
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
little bit more affordable we figured

396
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,360
that you know you're not flying anywhere

397
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
you're not actually going to a hotel

398
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,399
right the costs are significantly less

399
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
for us to produce it right

400
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,399
uh yet we find that the industry as a

401
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,160
whole is still charging ridiculous sums

402
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,519
man for like for the training that's

403
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,040
delivered over zoom right but the

404
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
quality i mean the the takeaways just

405
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
aren't there to justify those costs

406
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
and i'm just wondering you know like how

407
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
how do you think that's going to change

408
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
right

409
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,360
so i think the the whole idea of uh

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
at the end of the day specialist

411
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
training for specialists are

412
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
are quite expensive it's someone's time

413
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
that goes into the research into the

414
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
producing of the courses i think

415
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
from the core perspective the delivery

416
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
of the the content or the information

417
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
that it's transferred doesn't

418
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,240
necessarily change and that's what

419
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
someone is potentially paying for

420
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
um the delivery method is it's up for up

421
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
for grabs can be physical it can be

422
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,399
virtual

423
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
so i think as long as the the outcome

424
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,000
justifies the the sum then it should be

425
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,120
what it is

426
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,199
um but definitely we've seen a shift in

427
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
the in at least the costing or the

428
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
pricing of courses all around because

429
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,800
one can go do a short 10-minute video on

430
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,920
youtube for free versus a half an hour

431
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
session with someone you pay x amount

432
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,639
for it um so the costing has changed but

433
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,639
i think due to the fact that deliveries

434
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,079
delivery has changed so like to say

435
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,279
there's no

436
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,360
additional cost for process trainers for

437
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
change speeds apply somewhere and to in

438
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
like engage with hotels and stuff like

439
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,440
that but i definitely think from the

440
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
content side the content doesn't really

441
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,720
change um we keep on evolving we keep on

442
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
producing better and better quality

443
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
content

444
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
so that's theoretically what you pay for

445
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
at the end so if anybody does pay for

446
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
training um and they don't get the

447
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
quality from that then that's definitely

448
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
a serious discussion point to be raised

449
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
um but as long as the quality

450
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,600
equals the value that you that you pay

451
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
for i think that's a that's a reasonable

452
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
request um since it is people's time and

453
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,560
energy and research that goes into it i

454
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
mean you mentioned cost but i mean from

455
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,160
a human resource standpoint right i

456
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,760
think a lot of the

457
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
the pushback from trainers has been the

458
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
fact that attendees actually one more

459
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
one-on-one time and part of the reason

460
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,399
why you fly wherever around the world to

461
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,920
attend a training is that chance to

462
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,040
actually talk to the trainer

463
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
face-to-face right is that one-on-one

464
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,720
and if that's missing

465
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
then justify that x dollar it kind of

466
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
like starts having a diminishing scale

467
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
right and then of course now with the

468
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,320
fact that the training or the trainer

469
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,759
can kind of deliver it from the comfort

470
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,079
of his home more customized content

471
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,519
seems to be a request that we're getting

472
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,120
a lot as in there are certain customers

473
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
that want the same let's just say

474
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
hands-on hacking fundamentals course

475
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
right but they want it fine-tuned for

476
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,759
their industry you know what i mean like

477
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,120
more tailor-made for them right

478
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,199
yeah i think the there's there's quite a

479
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
lot of requests

480
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
for us as a business as well too to

481
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,440
deliver custom content for organizations

482
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,240
and

483
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
um there's potentially a a opportunity

484
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
there for people to to readjust and

485
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,839
deliver more custom content

486
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,560
um obviously the the core concepts of

487
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
the courses that we teach we try and aim

488
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
to have it already specialized into

489
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,320
various different categories and various

490
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,079
different modules that we that we

491
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,199
deliver

492
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,839
um so customizing even further to that

493
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
is is fine to some degree

494
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
but there is also still a time versus uh

495
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
versus output output level to this at

496
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,040
the end of the day we utilize our actual

497
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
penetration testers as trainers we don't

498
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,680
have any dedicated trainers can just be

499
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,320
on demand um so we literally pull people

500
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
off of projects which they're doing for

501
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
their clients or our clients

502
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,759
and push them into the training side

503
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,680
because they deliver the real world

504
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,839
knowledge the stuff that we utilize on

505
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
monday we can train on wednesday and and

506
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,399
still talk about the same type of stuff

507
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,199
that we see in the wild so i think

508
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,279
switching to customized training

509
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
is it's still not an easy thing there

510
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
still needs to be time to do that for

511
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
customers um but it's definitely not

512
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
something that's not an option um

513
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
usually with our more direct training so

514
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,119
if we deliver training directly for a

515
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,720
customer only so

516
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
customer comes and says they want

517
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,599
training for 10 people in their

518
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
organization

519
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,599
usually the live interaction between us

520
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,160
even over zoom even over virtual

521
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,119
training

522
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
it still aligns to the needs for them

523
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,959
because it's one-on-one for them as a as

524
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,319
an organization

525
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,919
um the type of questions that they can

526
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,039
ask us as trainers is is very specific

527
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,600
to their use cases their scenarios and

528
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
we can still produce answers that

529
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
actually fits those those needs and

530
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,760
engage with them so it's not a thing of

531
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
oh well now i'm remote now i can't

532
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
engage with you and properly answer your

533
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
questions it's actually more so because

534
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,559
people aren't distracted about

535
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,080
everything else that's going around so

536
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,679
they can be more deliberate in their

537
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,160
questioning which allows our analysts to

538
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
actually be more deliberate in their

539
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
answers

540
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
okay i mean for like fresh grads right

541
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
who are

542
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,559
unfortunately graduating in the time of

543
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,240
govid right

544
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
do you have any advice for them and then

545
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,280
like you know they're going to enter a

546
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,760
work industry that uh it's going to

547
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
demand from them certain knowledge that

548
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
doesn't get taught to you in school

549
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,679
right uh is there anything that you can

550
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,520
do in the interim just to set themselves

551
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
apart so that when they do enter the

552
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
workforce they're not starting at ground

553
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
zero and like you know i don't know

554
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,039
anything for training you know what i

555
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,480
mean which is like

556
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
not helpful

557
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,080
i think the big thing that so like you

558
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
mentioned um i think there's a lot of

559
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,919
people we actually seen quite a ramp up

560
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,600
in the amount of

561
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,440
entry-level entries into the industry

562
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,520
itself so people starting out a career

563
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,200
in university

564
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,960
so with that said there's a lot more

565
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,000
people

566
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
wanting the base fundamentals to start a

567
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,919
career in packing and penetration

568
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,160
testing even on the defense side people

569
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,440
starting out careers in the shock

570
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
industry

571
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
but with that said i think the best

572
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
advice that i have for anybody starting

573
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,440
out a career in this is understand that

574
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
penetration testing and security is

575
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,400
already a specialization on top of it as

576
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
a as a whole

577
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
so getting back to the basics is

578
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
definitely the first step for anybody so

579
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,679
understanding the tcp stack

580
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,799
understanding

581
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,960
the the internet understanding the base

582
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,120
fundamentals behind http

583
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,039
um before trying to go and hack it

584
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,200
understand what the concepts are what

585
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
the bases are before just deep diving

586
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,760
into oh well i'm gonna hack the planet

587
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
but i don't know what a terminal is

588
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,120
um so

589
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,919
the it is unfortunately a thing we've

590
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,760
seen quite often is people join our

591
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
hands on hacking fundamental course for

592
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,400
example

593
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,440
and expect us to to teach them

594
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,919
purely the basics of of what a computer

595
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,520
is and how it works

596
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
and it's not to say that we won't

597
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
accommodate our students on that we

598
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,480
definitely will like anybody is welcome

599
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
to join any of our trainees and we'll

600
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,960
we'll try and adjust our our approach to

601
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,799
that to accommodate them

602
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,440
but there is some fundamentals that that

603
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
is required so understanding what a

604
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
computer is hardware understanding a

605
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,240
little bit of what a terminal is um or

606
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,559
i've at least seen or heard of it is

607
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,080
definitely a bit of a

608
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
requirement before thinking well i'm

609
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
just gonna go and hack everything

610
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,480
understanding the basics is definitely a

611
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
thing so for graduates people starting

612
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
out um a career in in the penetration

613
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
system industries

614
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
make sure you've got a solid line

615
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,240
fundamentalist foundation um make sure

616
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
you understand the core technologies

617
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,880
utilized maybe maybe set up a

618
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,200
a just a legit lab for yourself not not

619
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,679
anything vulnerable but go and install a

620
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,880
server with

621
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,159
uh

622
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,200
i don't know

623
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,039
apache server on it and make sure you

624
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,120
understand the concepts of how to set up

625
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
a website make sure you understand how

626
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,760
to set up a domain controller um so

627
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
getting back to understanding the basic

628
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,400
principles will definitely help you to

629
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
identify the potential areas we can go

630
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,960
into and where vulnerabilities could

631
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
potentially exist in organizational

632
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
networks in web applications even in

633
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
wi-fi

634
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
but without having that that knowledge

635
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
applied we first understand the things

636
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
you can't understand how to attack or

637
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
potentially protect it

638
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,000
so this speaks about a concept that i've

639
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
been very passionate about the last few

640
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
years

641
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
is the idea of defense throughout things

642
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,840
so

643
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,679
just as we need to understand what

644
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,559
you're

645
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
what you're going to attack before you

646
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
can attack it one needs to understand

647
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,640
the attacker's mindset before you can

648
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,799
potentially defend against something

649
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,600
so

650
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,640
those two-way streets of of of knowledge

651
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
is definitely important in in learning

652
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
and educating yourself

653
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
um going forward

654
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
okay so for cyber week right you guys

655
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,120
are i mean if all things go well

656
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
we'll expect to see you guys in person

657
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
right like i mean the original defense

658
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
team is going to come down right

659
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,799
so um we if everything goes well um and

660
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,960
if we can figure out a way to not uh

661
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
quarantine ourselves for 14 days before

662
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,120
coming in another country except for

663
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
south africa apparently

664
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
that's the the case at this point we

665
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,880
need to travel from south africa to i

666
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
don't know egypt and stay there for 14

667
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,080
days and then travel to

668
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
abu dhabi um but if that changes will

669
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,559

from our orange business services we'll

672
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,080
probably set up a small booth there and

673
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
we'll try and be there either virtual or

674
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,919
in person as well

675
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,600
so we'll be looking forward to chatting

676
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,480
with anybody who comes by

677
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080

678
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840

683
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000

away

685
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280

686
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
situation will be fine

687
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,760
