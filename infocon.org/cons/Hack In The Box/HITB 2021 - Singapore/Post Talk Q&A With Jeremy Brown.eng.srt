hi guys uh we can't we can't see his uh

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,279

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439
av crew can i get a picture

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,439
on video i'm it's like in the middle of

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,720
the night sorry

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
ah oh you got video off okay okay that's

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
fine that's fine we didn't we didn't

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
realize that what time is it for you

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,000
anyway

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,239
midnight it's midnight hey thanks for

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,280
joining us man at midnight no less right

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,520
no worries no worries i i mean normally

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
i'm up at this time but yeah it's been a

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,600
long week so i want to get some sleep

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,360
so how was the how was the talk i mean

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
you just finished it right

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,840
uh yeah i mean i pre-recorded it so uh

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
yeah i think it went well yeah uh i

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
think i had some pretty good content

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
this with this week i finished up with

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
some uh with some new uh targets and

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,920
added some things there so uh yeah

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,438
hopefully hopefully everyone liked it

29
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
and yeah i'm

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
gonna release uh open source the fuzzer

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
in the next few weeks i've got a roadmap

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
for it and uh should be good awesome and

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,680
so this the the default that you're

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119
releasing right like you're working on

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
it on on your own or you know other is

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
the development team or what's the plan

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
no just me um yeah over the last uh few

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
weeks or so i've been basically uh

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
figuring out how to fuzz on mac and then

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,360
you know sort of riding the buzzer as i

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
go you know what as far as automatic

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,600
crash triage and like how to flows

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,920
network stuff on mac and how to get the

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
gui fuzzing going and stuff like that

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
have you found anything cool any

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
did you see you can share this

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
uh yeah yeah i mean i mean in the

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880
presentation i'll talk about finding

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
some bugs in applescript uh color sync

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,200
actually syslog on mac uh some

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
interesting stuff there

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
um and there's other cvs upcoming uh

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,840
that uh that'll come out from it but

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
yeah it's pretty successful project i

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
gotta say overall it's definitely worth

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
it

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
pretty cool man so the the what's the

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
main difference i mean in combat this

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
tool to what else is available out there

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,680
i mean like what enhancements have you

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
done to it that makes it still there

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
yeah well i took an approach of i really

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
want something i want a fuzzer that i

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
can uh spin up and get running on all

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
the major platforms linux windows mac um

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
i don't want there to be all these crazy

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
dependencies and

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
you got to set up a certain

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,519
instrumentation framework on this or

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
that i want to make it really really

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
easy to to generically fuzz you know

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,040
files network uh all kinds of different

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,840
stuff gui's across platforms uh so that

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
what that's what made me come up with

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
with light fuzz uh but those are used in

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
the project

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,879
and um yeah just took that approach to

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
it i just wanted to work across

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
platforms and not have to install all

80
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,080
kinds of different stuff to do that hey

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
so i we completely missed your top row

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
because you were in the previous in the

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
previous interview session uh would it

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
be possible for you to do a quick demo

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,519
first like i don't know whether you can

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,800
do screen sharing now whether you're if

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,920
you're not up to it it's fine man i mean

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
i'm just asking right you can easily say

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
no oh

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,159
i'm on my phone right now you're on your

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,200
phone okay

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
can't be done with that but uh

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
yeah i mean we do we have any questions

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,879
uh

95
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,480
we don't have any questions about the

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,159
talk you did talk about some overlooked

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
attack surface on mac os right so

98
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
i mean as a defender or someone who's

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
fuzzing on on the mac os what what

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
should they be looking for or what are

101
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,040
the attack surface that should they

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,519
should be looking at

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
yeah it's quite big and i've talked

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
about some of this in the talk where i'm

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,599
really looking at the default uh stuff

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
that's on and also just the core

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
applications on mac so

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
on mac there's i mean it's it's

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
basically the platform that wants to

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
support it traditionally wants to

111
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
support multimedia for everything i mean

112
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
if you look at the different file

113
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,319
handlers on it there's i mean there's i

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,680
think 420 different file types

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
that you could see that have stuff

116
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
they're opening opening applications

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,319
with it

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
there's a ton of different uri handlers

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
and this is default mac

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
os stuff that we're talking about so

121
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
that besides all the network demons and

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
all the different um you know clients

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
and screen sharing and stuff you can

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,279
turn on there's quite a bit of attack

125
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
surface and a lot of it doesn't seem to

126
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,479
be

127
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,639
uh touched before or maybe you know as

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
touched a long time ago maybe apple has

129
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,919
been doing some campaigns a long time

130
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,479
ago but um i was able to shake out some

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,960
pretty interesting crashes uh that were

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
that seemed simple to get to but they

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
just you know maybe just been overlooked

134
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,840
deprioritized in favor of you know

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
going after safari you're going after

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
different jailbreak stuff so there's

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
there's quite a bit of attack service

138
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
out there on default max that you've got

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
to look out for

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
hmm yeah i think we've seen quite a few

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
vulnerabilities come on in the past few

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,320
months right like the gatekeeper one

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
and the one with the wi-fi diamonds

144
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,600
interesting with the format stream

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
vulnerability uh format strings are a

146
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,680
favorite bug of mine for a long time and

147
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
uh that came out and it actually sort of

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,400
inspired some of the um

149
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
some of the different takes i was

150
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,080
looking at on the network daemons

151
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,039
there's a cd uh cd dvd sharing feature

152
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,479
actually on mac that you can over the

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
network you can share

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,880
a cd drive or dvd you know over the

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
network and one of the features or one

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
of the yeah features of that particular

157
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,479
daemon is it'll ask you hey this user is

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
asking permission to

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
access the drive

160
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
and the the user it presents to you and

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,400
also the computers coming from are

162
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
strings that you manipulate so for fun i

163
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
just put some format specifiers in there

164
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,720
to see if anything would trigger i

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
didn't get the trigger on that but i use

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
that as one of the fuzzing payloads to

167
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
see if there's uh you know some bugs

168
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
there so that was inspired by some of

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
the recent bugs on mac

170
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
and um i mean from apple's side right

171
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,000
now everything is all m1 right the new

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,199
macbook pros are supposed to be coming

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,560
out i don't know two months time or

174
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
something like that

175
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
does it change things a lot for when it

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
comes to fuzzing then like are the tools

177
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,639
that's going to have to be rewritten

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
again or

179
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
um no it shouldn't change too much so so

180
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
so two parts to that one the fuzzer is

181
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
written in python

182
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
so you know there's not a lot of changes

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,639
as far as running it as that goes as

184
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
long as python runs on m1 i'm sure it

185
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,800
does that part should be fine

186
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
the only part it would change would be

187
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
the exploitation of

188
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
of some of the bugs

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,520
you know if there were memory corruption

190
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,039
bugs of course

191
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,400
different architectures that be

192
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
exploited differently

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
i'm not sure what the what the game is

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
on m1

195
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
as i haven't got to play with it too

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
much but yeah i'm actually interested to

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
see

198
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
some of the exploits that come out that

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
target the particular architecture

200
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
for for upcoming mac os systems so uh

201
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,599
yeah that'll be fun to see it'll be

202
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,960
interesting because i mean it's arm

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,039
based after all right so if you think

204
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,479
about it from that point of view then

205
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,440
the

206
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,280
kind of devices that you

207
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
open up to also it becomes quite

208
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
interesting

209
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
yeah yeah definitely it's uh it's in and

210
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
where it's arm-based too you don't

211
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
don't necessarily know which features

212
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,039
are turning on and off maybe there's

213
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
some new apple silicon stuff coming out

214
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,759
as far as mitigations go so yeah um yeah

215
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
i'm sure the industry's up up to the

216
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
task i'm sure there'll be some really

217
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
cool research coming out for that you

218
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,560
know this year and next yeah for sure we

219
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,840
always know attackers are going to be

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
like the first to try and break this

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
stuff as soon as they get it right like

222
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,639
ten thousand dollar laptop let me try

223
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,280
and break it man

224
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
yes i mean that's that's what we do

225
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
right yeah that's what we do that's what

226
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,319
keep hacking man uh hey bro i'm we don't

227
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,520
really have any other questions i know

228
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
it's really late for you uh is there

229
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,560
anything you want to

230
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
chat about in particular else we'll let

231
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
you get to bed man i mean you know i

232
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
feel bad keeping you awake

233
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
no worries no worries at all i mean i i

234
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,800
appreciate uh getting to

235
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
do the research is something that has

236
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,720
been provided to provide over the summer

237
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
um again the biggest question that i've

238
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,479
got uh for the last couple weeks is when

239
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,919
the fuzzer is coming out

240
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,599
um sorry i wish it would come out the

241
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,199
same time

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,720
i need i need a little bit more time to

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,840
polish it

244
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
you know in the talk i give a lot of

245
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
demos of how to use the buzzer i'm like

246
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
uh you know oh i will get it out there

247
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
uh it is getting open source soon it'll

248
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
be available on github in a few weeks

249
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
i'm just making some um you know

250
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
fixing some fixing some bugs you know

251
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
all the all the software dev stuff which

252
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
uh non-developers love to do

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
and you'll be able to use it and go go

254
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
hack all the things on mac linux and

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
windows you're still you're still with

256
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,279
nvidia right or are you working

257
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
somewhere else now

258
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,559
no no uh

259
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,479
i actually took the summer off so i've

260
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
been a free agent so far cool yeah

261
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
any chance you are going to be up for

262
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
making a trip or trying to stay safe for

263
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
the rest of the year and no no trips

264
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
planned

265
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
oh maybe maybe domestically i've been

266
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,279
looking at the midwest for a bit i've

267
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
been enjoying some hiking and uh

268
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
canyonland stuff which i got to do in

269
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
vegas uh when i was at defcon recently

270
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
nice um so probably no international

271
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
ones but i'll definitely uh i love

272
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
malaysia and i definitely want to make

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,519
it back in singapore for that matter i

274
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,600
got i've got a currency in singapore so

275
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,160
i got a good reason to visit there too

276
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
well hopefully next year right i mean uh

277
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
since i guess this year is pretty much

278
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
like a write-off most people are

279
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,080
probably not going to be traveling um

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,560
maybe we'll see you in the summer of

281
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
2022 yeah

282
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
i i hope so so it's been a pleasure and

283
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,080
yeah thanks deal on big stream uh good

284
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,279
luck with the rest of the con i know

285
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,560
i'll be watching the live stream

286
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
excellent job so far as usual uh yeah i

287
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,480
