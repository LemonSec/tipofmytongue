1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,880
i think mark is uh in the studio with us

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
i believe and we have a bunch of

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,040
questions for you hey dude how are you

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,200
man all good

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
uh man we totally wish we could be

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,359
having this conversation in person and

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,400
you know

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
be chilling out in singapore but what

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,920
can we do right like stupid goldberg

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
i've been in lockdown for the last uh

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,119
months or something

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
we've been on lockdown for like 18

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,600
months bro i haven't we haven't left the

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,879
country right

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
since my last year was like february of

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
2020 so yeah it's kind of weird and kind

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,719
of weird

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,680
anyway

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,840
uh what's new man how's things with

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
azimuth how's the team how's everybody

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,440
doing

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,320
yes i'm doing really great uh you know

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
everything's been um

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
you know obviously working around uh

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
covered restrictions and not being able

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
to travel has been kind of annoying i

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
would really like to go on to um

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
like that at various other conferences

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,560
that's getting cancelled but um

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
otherwise things were going good i um

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,159
the

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
i timed the keynote before i gave it and

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
it was like an hour and ten minutes so i

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
was speeding through it

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,439
you nailed it dude i mean it was like

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,119
one hour and one minute i think i was

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,400
looking at the counter like yeah man

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
that's like super

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
i mean we always prefer speakers that

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
have a slightly longer presentation

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
because we've got guys who like we give

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
them an hour right and then they rush

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
through their presentation and they and

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
they finish in half an hour so which is

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
we prefer that you take all the time you

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,360
need man uh hey bro

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,280
go ahead go ahead sorry

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
uh yeah i am i was worried about the

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,759
same thing but um yeah it worked out

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
exactly now so it was perfect man anyway

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
so we've got a couple of questions for

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
you man so uh i'll start off with

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
something easy so this is actually from

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
cooper uh he he asked uh you were

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
mentioning a lot about ios as leading in

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
the exploit prevention kind of scene

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
right but uh do you see that android

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,399
keeping up catching up

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
falling behind yeah

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
i i kind of noticed that um

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
at the end of my presentation that i was

62
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,599
focusing on a lot on ios and that's

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,959
because

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,360
personally i'm like i've taken more of

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
an interest in ios um but that's not to

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
say other platforms aren't doing the

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,959
same thing

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
um i i feel like um

69
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
like android is hard to say because it's

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
niko's it's kind of a operating system

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
but it depends on

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,640
uh you know how vendors deploy it as to

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
how secure it is you know uh google's

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,000
deployment like with the pixels is

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
particularly good usually it doesn't

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,360
have a lot of you know

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,959
extra fender wear

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
they put a lot of work into

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
you know the titan tips and stuff like

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,239
that so

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,200
um

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
samsung increasingly has done a really

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
good job their security used to be

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,000
really bad and this is also true of

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
huawei both of these vendors used to

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
have pretty shocking security but um

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
have improved

88
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
tremendously

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
over the past few years

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
i will say to the average person though

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,959
that

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
ios i would say is more secure from

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
their particular threat model but for

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
other threat models that might not be as

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,599
true

96
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
um the high value targets and things

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
like that

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,720
as potentially worth re-examining

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,519
because ios has like a larger promoted

100
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
pack service i think and that has been

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,959
shown with like a lot of imessage

102
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,400
vulnerabilities

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,159
and that kind of thing

104
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,080
and i also would say that microsoft has

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
actually done really well

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
over the past few years there was a

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
bunch of microsoft stuff that i ended up

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,959
putting out of the talk but if you um go

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
and follow um david weston

110
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,239
on twitter uh he's a microsoft guy he's

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
always talking about what they're up to

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
you have a really great speech at

113
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
blackhead in 2016 that talked about not

114
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
only the mitigations and stuff that

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
they're putting in place but the data

116
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
behind it like why they decided to do

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
the mitigations they did and stuff like

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
that and um

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,239
that's really interesting as well cool

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,079
so actually talking about uh google

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
right and like uh they've got some

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
insane computing power when it comes to

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
fuzzing right so this is a question from

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,360
a guest so we don't really know who

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,000
asked this question but the question is

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
uh the power of google's fuzzing engines

127
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,240
versus a single researcher

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
uh how can can you expect to find cool

129
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
bugs as in when you have a when you're

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
going up against a company that's

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
fuzzing like 29 000 bucks or something

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
like that right like by the time you

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,639
find something it's batch right

134
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,080
so definitely um google's uh compute

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,520
infrastructure creates a problem for um

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
you know an authentic researcher looking

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
to find vulnerabilities

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
um but basically there's uh there's

139
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
still ways to find vulnerabilities and

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,800
usually

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,680
um

142
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,320
the the strategies you have is you can

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,639
fuzz but generally you can't buzz as

144
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,240
aggressively as them so you have to try

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,440
and fuzz more intelligently um you have

146
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
to put more of your own like uh looking

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,840
for very specific um things that uh you

148
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
know about maybe bug classes that aren't

149
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
talked about a lot or that aren't

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
provide or that they don't have

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
provisions for in their large scale

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
buzzing um and of course there's also

153
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
like you know manual code inspection

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,039
where you find

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,039
uh have the potential to find unusual

156
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
bugs which again are

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
unlikely to come up in buzzing so

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
if you are buzzing against google

159
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,880
and and even other companies mozilla and

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
stuff

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
um you have to do uh something you need

162
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
in order to

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
uh i think find a vulnerability um

164
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,720
that's going to have any it's gonna last

165
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
longer than like a week or two

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
do you think that you know most of the

167
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
fuzz's uh fuzzing tools actually have

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
evolved to keep up with like trying to

169
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,840
find the bugs because you know you're

170
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
looking at google and you've got like

171
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,880
distributed computing

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
everything's in the cloud right they're

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
going to be able to fuzz like a lot more

174
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,759
right so what kind of tools would you

175
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
suggest like if you're trying to find

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
bugs right in ios

177
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,520
what kind of tool sets would you be

178
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
looking at

179
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
i mean i think

180
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,199
there's a number of buzzing technologies

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,639
that you can

182
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,120
use to help you fuzzing but like if

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
you're using the same tools as other

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,800
people

185
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
your vulnerabilities aren't going to

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
last very long basically you have to do

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,759
something unique

188
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,600
um so whatever tools you choose

189
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,479
uh

190
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
you know and uh

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
you're still gonna have to add some of

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
your own logic and so what uh generally

193
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,000
people do is use

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
like fuzzing stuff that exists um but

195
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,479
they'll just use it as a component of a

196
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
fuzzing suite so you know everyone

197
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
integrates afl in one form or another um

198
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
and you know everyone uses asan and all

199
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
this kind of stuff

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
but on top of that

201
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
you know you kind of want to put in your

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
own

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
sort of unique things that you're

204
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,880
looking for i suppose um and that's the

205
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
only way you're going to extract value

206
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
so i don't know about a specific tool i

207
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
can tell you like because i don't think

208
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
that really you can just download a tool

209
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,319
and run it and

210
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
have a huge amount of success um and

211
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,039
even like i said even if you find stuff

212
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
i don't think it will last longer than a

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,599
week or two um but

214
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,800
you know you can use them as a base uh

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
to start you know

216
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
putting more of your own stuff in it you

217
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,840
know you can get

218
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,039
um

219
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
uh sis caller and all these kind of

220
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,479
things um

221
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,280
and

222
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
you know start building on them

223
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
um and so yeah i'm not sure about just

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
something off the shelf

225
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,400
probably there isn't man that's the

226
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
exact reason why you can't find one

227
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,080
yeah uh it's a question from another

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,879
guest

229
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
exploit sales versus techniques uh are

230
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,879
the prices increasing because

231
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,479
researchers are essentially selling

232
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,560
techniques rather than individual

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
exploits as in like you know now it's a

234
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
chain right so

235
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,639
do you think the prices are great

236
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,440
so

237
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
i'm i'm not sure that i've ever seen

238
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,599
evidence of someone just selling a

239
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,080
technique per se um this was this

240
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
discussion actually

241
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,080
did come up on twitter a fair while ago

242
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,319
with i think it was with alyssa assange

243
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,800
who i referred to in my presentation

244
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
um and she said something about it

245
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
but i can't remember what her conclusion

246
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
was

247
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
uh but as far as i i know um i haven't

248
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
seen people

249
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,479
sell techniques per se except if uh in

250
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,279
cases where um the technique

251
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,640
um is

252
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,839
like a

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
significant bypass in itself

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
um

255
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
so for example um you might

256
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
you might be able to sell a component

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,880
that is just

258
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
um you know a uh

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
you know a pack bypass or something like

260
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,399
that

261
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
um and you go you know if you've got a

262
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
kernel bug and you use this then you can

263
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
do this

264
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,959
so

265
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
there is instances of selling those as

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
standalone vulnerabilities i think um

267
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,880
but not selling techniques as in like

268
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
um hey uh if you

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
uh can write to anywhere in memory

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,600
blindly

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,920
on the ios kernel here's a way to turn

272
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
it into um you know

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
arbitrary

274
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
memory read write reliably without an

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,080
info league that'd be a useful technique

276
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
but i've never at least

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
seen evidence of selling that as a

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,080
standalone thing

279
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
let's see what else do we have here uh

280
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
okay so there's a question i'm not sure

281
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,839
whether you can answer this or not but

282
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
some the question is can you tell us the

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
behind the scenes stories of what

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
happened with the fbi

285
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,040
uh

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,199
no

287
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,880
[Music]

288
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
not really

289
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,040
i don't think that story's ever been uh

290
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,959
validated uh

291
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,600
or publicly affirmed okay so let's just

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,279
pretend right i mean if you are a

293
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,040
security researcher and the fbi comes to

294
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
you and asks you to do something right

295
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
like what choices do you have can you

296
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,519
actually say no

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,360
or would that not be advisable

298
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,800
yeah i mean

299
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
i don't know uh

300
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,399
i mean i don't think in western

301
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
countries uh

302
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
you know law enforcement really shows up

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
at your door and forces you to do stuff

304
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,839
um

305
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,760
and uh furthermore i don't live in

306
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
america but um

307
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
yeah like

308
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,800
i mean

309
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
who can who can say

310
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,079
i think

311
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,600
i think in some other countries where

312
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
they're more authoritarian regimes they

313
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
totally do do that all the time what

314
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,519
about like you know i mean this is just

315
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,040
from my own question and then like for

316
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
the legal threat from apple right like

317
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
if you were to

318
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,839
you know help law enforcement to unlock

319
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,040
something and then they come about and

320
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,079
tell you like hey you're not supposed to

321
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
do that like as an individual researcher

322
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
should you be concerned about that or

323
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
you know quote-unquote greater good i

324
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,120
mean like there's loads of arguments for

325
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
it for and against obviously so i mean

326
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,920
in your opinion what do you think

327
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
not really so i mean doing vulnerability

328
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
research as an individual um

329
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
i mean there's nothing illegal about it

330
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
you're totally allowed to do it and then

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
um

332
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
i mean

333
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
uh where you start running into trouble

334
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,120
is kind of like i alluded to in my

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
presentation which is

336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,720
if you uh

337
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,920
you know

338
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,640
deploy tools offensively that you know

339
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
utilize infrastructure

340
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
to a significant degree to like migrate

341
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
or something like that um then you might

342
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
start seeing yourself in

343
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
in legal trouble having said that i i

344
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
would guess that um even in those cases

345
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,440
like the researcher you wouldn't the

346
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
researcher wouldn't get in trouble it's

347
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,399
whoever's deploying it would get in

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,120
trouble um you know you can

349
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,519
you can make any offensive research that

350
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,560
you want

351
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
um it's only illegal if someone deploys

352
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,839
it in a situation where they don't have

353
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
the authority to do so right

354
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,160
make sense make sense i got a question

355
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,839
here what's your opinion on coreylium

356
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
i i mean i've been pretty supportive of

357
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
them publicly i think their technology

358
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
is really

359
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
like crazy good um and

360
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,120
iphone is a particularly difficult

361
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,760
target to research because

362
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,639
you know

363
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,320
for a number of reasons one is you have

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,040
to basically jailbreak it in order to do

365
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
any real research and even when you

366
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
jailbreak it you've got this really

367
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,839
crappy semi-debug environment you can't

368
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,959
debug the kernel uh usually um with a

369
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,279
few exceptions brandon azad made a thing

370
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,160
um

371
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,519
in fact uh the the checkmate uh stuff

372
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
sort of made it possible to do some some

373
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,079
of this debugging kind of nicely

374
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
um but you've got to jailbreak the phone

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
um

376
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
a lot of the times you can't upgrade and

377
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
downgrade and stuff like that

378
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
it's just very restrictive and um

379
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
being able to have a virtual machine

380
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
where you go just you know spin up an

381
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
iphone 10

382
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
and um

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,360
and uh you know

384
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
install ios

385
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,279
you know 13 on it i want to look at that

386
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
uh is a really good a really useful

387
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
capability and within five minutes of

388
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,279
installing it you're like okay

389
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
i can debug stuff i can put files on it

390
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,880
i can run kind of thing um and even

391
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,199
and another thing um so of course apple

392
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
now has the security research devices

393
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
but only a few people have those and

394
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,920
it's at the behest of apple

395
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,240
um and even with things like checkmate

396
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
and stuff where you're able to uh

397
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
perhaps do some meaningful debugging

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you still have the problem that um you

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,079
can't do things at scale

400
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,079
um you know one of the advantages of

401
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
corellium is you can programmatically

402
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,079
spin up a thousand instances of

403
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,399
different phones and do fuzzing or

404
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
testing or you know whatever you want

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
and so i think that's

406
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,199
i i mean i think that's a really good

407
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
event advantage for security researchers

408
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,120
as well

409
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,760
and lastly um for doing things like if

410
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
you're doing app and testing and stuff

411
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
like that i think it's really useful for

412
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
that because again you don't have to

413
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
jailbreak the phone if you're just

414
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
you know some

415
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
company that pen test apps

416
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
um you don't have to jailbreak the phone

417
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
and have like a 10 versions old phone

418
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
and all this you can spin up the most

419
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,199
modern version

420
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,279
um and uh

421
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
hopefully create reproducible results um

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
you can put the app

423
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,959
on your phone you can um produce a

424
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,560
result and then you can

425
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,639
give the result to someone and go here's

426
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,880
a snapshot of me doing it like here's

427
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
the proof of it so i think it's got a

428
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,959
lot of advantages um quite frankly

429
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
might want to take a question

430
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,959
um i think there's just one one last one

431
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
left which is back to your point is

432
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
jailbreaking dead or is there still

433
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
advantageous to using it now

434
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,079
no i don't think it's dead um

435
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,279
a lot of the times public jailbreaks

436
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,160
tend not to come out because um

437
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,079
because of the value of

438
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,839
like the commercial value of them i

439
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
suppose um but having said that

440
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,519
you know um over the last

441
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,320
uh

442
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
way back in um

443
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,480
ios six or seven i started thinking like

444
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
oh this is pretty hard i don't think

445
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,920
people are just gonna continue releasing

446
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,199
these for free

447
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,959
um and at the time a lot of

448
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,480
western groups stopped releasing and

449
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
chinese groups were

450
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
releasing jailbreaks for whatever

451
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,839
motivations they had

452
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,759
um but beyond that um

453
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,680
i don't think jailbreaking is dead uh

454
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,199
just because

455
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
uh firstly every now and then a

456
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,959
vulnerability comes along that is really

457
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
useful for

458
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
jailbreaking um like the um when

459
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,839
checkmate came out of nowhere and you

460
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
know that has um

461
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
reinvigorated uh

462
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,519
jailbreaking the ability to do

463
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,680
meaningful debugging on recent versions

464
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
of ios

465
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,360
in a way that no other bug has since

466
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,600
like 24k pone or something like that

467
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,199
because it was in the boot rom like you

468
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,399
couldn't fix it

469
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,680
and so that was really good for

470
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,839
jailbreaking additionally i would say

471
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
that every now and then um

472
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,120
groups like project zero basically um

473
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
bring out either a partial or

474
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
pretty complete

475
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,199
jailbreak uh

476
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,920
tool set um like i referred to before

477
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,399
brandon azad did it before

478
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
he's like hey you can actually do kernel

479
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,360
debugging um

480
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
with this vulnerability i found kind of

481
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,279
kind of thing so um i think every now

482
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,000
and then those groups also um produce

483
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
tools that are useful

484
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,600
um but having said that the the ones

485
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
that are like project zero are useful

486
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
for security researchers but for the

487
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
general people that like jailbreaking so

488
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,199
they can use cydia or something

489
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,679
that's not going to be um

490
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
as useful for perhaps yeah so yeah i

491
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
mean i would say also kind of like the

492
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
public jailbreaking kind of scene has

493
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,839
more or less died because a lot of the

494
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
guys got hired right i mean people ended

495
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
up working at apple or you know they got

496
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
you know ended up working in ezreals for

497
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,559
example uh and then it's kind of like

498
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,919
they stopped reducing their jailbreak

499
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,679
right

500
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,760
yeah i mean that happened to an extent

501
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,799
um like i said uh a bunch at some point

502
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,480
in time a bunch of chinese groups took

503
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
over and it seemed like they were being

504
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
financially incentivized to do so

505
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
um and uh

506
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
you know

507
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,559
but then there was this there's this

508
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,440
weird situation uh now where

509
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
uh the chinese government i think is

510
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
being more restrictive about just

511
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
releasing vulnerabilities at like

512
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
pontoon and that kind of thing

513
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
um and so i don't know

514
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
uh the latest on that and how that will

515
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
impact those groups but um

516
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,360
at least

517
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
regular releases of public jailbreaks

518
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,039
you're right has completely dried up

519
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
yeah um and was supplanted by you know

520
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
the checkmate and pongo os and all that

521
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
kind of stuff for

522
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
uh for at least a little while but um

523
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
uh as that diminishes um then

524
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,360
yeah i'm not sure what's gonna happen

525
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
cool man um i don't think we have any

526
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
other questions uh but we still have

527
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,160
about 11 minutes left

528
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
is there anything you can you can chat

529
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
about other stuff if you like or if you

530
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
you know

531
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,840
in particular you want to tell us yeah

532
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
uh yeah

533
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
what would you like to hear about i want

534
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,080
to know what you guys have been working

535
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
on recently as in personally azimuth

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
right like what's the latest and

537
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,039
greatest stuff like any new tools any

538
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
new

539
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
stuff that you guys can publicly

540
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,559
disclose at this point

541
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,720
um there's not a lot of stuff to

542
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,760
publicly disclose although we have um

543
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,919
for some period of time been sort of

544
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,880
planning to um relaunch a blog which i

545
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
think is going to happen shortly and

546
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,799
we had a couple of things we wanted to

547
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
publish on that um

548
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,240
you know one thing that we did fairly

549
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,039
recently is one of the uh stuff

550
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
uh staff members entered our ponchon

551
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,000
this year

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,039
and did an exploit for um parallels and

553
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
so he's actually written that up and

554
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
like

555
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
you know the the nature of the bug and

556
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,960
um you know the exploit methodology that

557
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
he employed to do that awesome um

558
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,520
there's been a couple of other uh

559
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
you know we had another researcher

560
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,240
analyzing in the wild uh chrome exploit

561
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,799
that we were um we're about to publish

562
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
our analysis but then like uh

563
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
google or someone did um so we're like

564
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,400
oh

565
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,360
um

566
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
uh

567
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
but we might just put that out anyway um

568
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
and so uh and there's a a couple of

569
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
other things um that uh we were sort of

570
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,840
planning to

571
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
put out there as well in terms of

572
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,559
tooling and stuff like that um so that

573
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,520
there is stuff in the works that is

574
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,480
um

575
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,559
going to come out at some point in time

576
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,960
presumably but uh

577
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
you know i'm not i'm not sure exactly

578
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
when to be honest are you guys uh up for

579
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
traveling this year or no travel plans

580
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,159
at all like i'm not sure what the legal

581
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,000
you know possibilities are for making a

582
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
trip out of australia but are you guys

583
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
planning anything yeah so

584
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,400
yeah so i really would like to i was

585
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
hoping uh

586
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,159
to go to blackout this year and

587
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,520
obviously originally i was hoping to

588
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
come to hack in the box

589
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
um the situation in australia is more or

590
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,159
less that

591
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,919
you can't really travel

592
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
unless you have an exemption to travel

593
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,679
and you can get an exemption for various

594
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
reasons like family or uh if you have a

595
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,720
compelling business reason uh you can go

596
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,039
but um uh

597
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,960
they're being i think handed out rather

598
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,919
sparingly right um so it's not easy to

599
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,960
just go

600
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
you know what i want to go to a

601
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
conference in vegas they're like oh cool

602
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,600
um

603
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,440
as i understand it we're not really

604
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,960
going to be able to do international

605
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
travel until

606
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,480
um i don't know december or january or

607
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,280
something um but when we can uh

608
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,919
obviously i will um

609
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,320
be back around i really hope to

610
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,840
be able to go to offensive con in

611
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,440
