1
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,519
hi and welcome to uh probably one of the

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,719
first

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,920
uh presentations about

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
ai practical ai resume

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,240
and with an example of fashion

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,439
recognition

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,560
systems

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
uh my name is alex i'm

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
in

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
cyber security for about 18 years

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,079
starting from networks

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,040
up to databases applications

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
business critical systems and

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,800
ai i'm a founder of adverse ai

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,200
member fourth technology council wrote a

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,079
number of books

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
been in

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
dozens of different security conferences

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,199
and presented my

20
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
research i'm also very excited in other

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,199
uh

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,199
technology areas such as synthetic

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
biology neuroscience and

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,720
psyche

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,080
and

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
how i come up to the

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
ai security field i'll tell the just a

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
short story

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
so

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
about five years ago

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,680
uh we used to develop a user behavior

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,759
analytics system to

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,799
detect anonymous behavior

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,680
in critical applications

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
uh and at that time and we used a lot of

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,439
ml

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
uh and ai we we actually had a like a

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
brain system with multiple algorithms

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
and dedicated are on the team to for uh

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,799
for researching in ai space and

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
cybersecurity space

42
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
and then i found the research paper that

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,840
ai systems and basically neural networks

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
have a vulnerabilities and you can you

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,399
know uh fool the system

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
and at that moment i realized that we we

47
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,479
cannot

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,560
you know develop the

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,318
ai driven cybersecurity solution

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,319
without solving the task of uh

51
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,280
securing ai itself

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
and then i found out that's that the

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,440
only way

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
to do that is to

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
create a company that

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
basically will

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
put all the efforts to

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,400
uh

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
solve this mission and this is how

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,680
adverse

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
ai was created so we are startup with a

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,160
mission to increase trust in ai systems

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,239
actually by protecting

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,040
ai from cyber threats and i believe that

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
uh by making ai systems more secure we

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,959
can

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,519
actually make them uh

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,959
better in

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
any other areas as well

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,040
and we work in three different

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
directions uh in awareness area in

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
assessment area and insurance

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,560
in terms of awareness we

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
created a report on

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,879
ai

76
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,680
vulnerabilities we

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
provide like

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
newsletters and uh weekly digest on all

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
of these areas

80
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
uh in terms of assessment uh we do air

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
rate teaming uh this is what i will

82
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
tell about the more details and in terms

83
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
of assurance we uh have solutions and we

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
provide solutions to actually protect uh

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
the system ai systems from

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
uh various attacks and

87
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,120
uh in this presentation you will get a

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
bit more details on what kind of attacks

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
i'm talking about

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
so in this presentation i'll

91
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
briefly uh tell you about the ai

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
security in general so that you can just

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
understand uh the problem

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,519
uh then we will

95
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,799
uh continue with details on ai red

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,000
teaming

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
uh then we will

98
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
learn a little bit more about the

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
attacks in digital world and the most

100
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,759
important part we will uh continue with

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
attacks on the physical world

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
and uh cyber physical security and this

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
is

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
what ai returning is mostly

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,199
all about

106
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
and in the end of the presentation we of

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
course will uh touch defense part

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
uh and

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
some takeaways so

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
let's go

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
secure ai

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
so why securing ai is essential and

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
what's what's basically the difference

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
uh and i'm

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,919
i'm sure that the difference is uh

116
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,400
tremendous it's really it's really huge

117
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
so in the traditional software we have

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
some kind of fixed program logic and we

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
interact with this software with help of

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,600
uh different commands

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
and those comments

122
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
are usually structured

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
so

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,400
in most cases the typical

125
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
vulnerabilities in uh traditional

126
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
software are

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
improper validation such as buffer flow

128
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
sql injections squares or shifting like

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,960
name

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,759
any uh mostly it's like it's improper

131
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
validation of course we have some access

132
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,639
control

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,520
things like misconfigurations but

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
you know most of the most critical uh

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
attacks are improper validation

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
in ai

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
we have a solutions that are basically

138
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
powered by some kind of flexible machine

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,639
learning

140
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,680
training

141
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
and we interact with this software

142
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
with help of uh some cognitive uh

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
ai interfaces like a vision

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,160
audio language and so on so this is like

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,680
unstructured data

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,199
uh and the

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,080
in this in the applications we have new

148
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
types of attacks which are

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
basically uh

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
similar in the

151
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
uh in high level

152
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
they also have like

153
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
they also have invasion type of attack

154
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
poisoning

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
exfiltration

156
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
but those attacks are

157
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,000
in the different

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,960
uh

159
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
areas in the unstructured data

160
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
so while we kind of know how to protect

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,319
our systems from sql injections uh

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
because we can you know sanitize input

163
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
we have no idea right now how to

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,479
sanitize input in the

165
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
video flow like what is okay in the

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
video and what is not what is okay in

167
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
the language comments what is okay in a

168
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,400
audio like it's a completely different

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
uh

170
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,199
type of software it's completely

171
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,440
different type of interfaces

172
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
it's completely different

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,400
uh

174
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
types of vulnerabilities and and so on

175
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,560
so the threat landscape is changing

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
and

177
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,919
it's like uh

178
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,840
in the 90s we had a network security

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,639
uh

180
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
then in the 2000s we have uh we had a

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
uh

182
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,599
endpoint security and like in 2010

183
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,479
there was an era of application security

184
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,400
and now from 2020 we will have an

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
era of ai security

186
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
and why it's it's critical

187
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
right now uh

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
because we already had examples of

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
uh confidentiality integrity and

190
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
availability

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
uh problems like um

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
personal data was extracted from a

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
netflix data set that was shared for

194
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,479
uh machine learning uh contest

195
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,599
uh in terms of integrity uh there was a

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
real vulnerability in silence ai driven

197
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,400
malware detection engine

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,039
that was bypassed because of the

199
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,160
vulnerabilities in machine learning

200
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
algorithm

201
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
uh we keep hearing a lot of

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
news about uh

203
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,599
tesla uh problems uh autopilot problems

204
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
in other other

205
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,399
uh examples so it's already

206
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,440
uh

207
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,599
critical and we already have problems

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,760
here

209
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,839
so what are we talking about in general

210
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,519
uh what are the

211
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,240
ai applications so in this

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
slide you can see the

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,399
list of

214
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,279
applications ai applications that had

215
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
the biggest number of uh

216
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
research papers devoted to security of

217
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
those applications

218
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
um

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
so we see that

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
obviously the image classification like

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,519
facial recognition uh

222
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
malware detection and all those

223
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
applications

224
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,480
already have a lot of

225
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
real vulnerabilities and real attacks

226
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,519
so who is affected uh actually the

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
both the

228
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
the new types of uh

229
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,720
new industries like autonomous driving

230
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,399
like robotics

231
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,320
uh they obviously are are

232
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
uh

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
potentially uh vulnerable to

234
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,680
uh like ai attacks but also we have a

235
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
lot of old school industries like

236
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,839
healthcare

237
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,040
finance

238
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,920
and they have more they implement more

239
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
and more uh ai things and

240
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,920
uh

241
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
obviously maybe uh

242
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
vulnerable to

243
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,160
uh various ai driven uh

244
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
air driven attacks

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
um

246
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,000
a little bit on the history of um

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
attacks on ai

248
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
well well it's basically started way uh

249
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,240
before 2010

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,120
uh but the the real

251
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
like attention to this

252
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,079
uh topic probably started in 2014-15

253
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
after the the first uh

254
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
presentation about the uh post research

255
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
about the adversarial attacks

256
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,839
um

257
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
and then uh we started to see more and

258
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,600
more our research papers

259
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,399
uh

260
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,519
either

261
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,560
on

262
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,800
one of different types of attacks on um

263
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
ai applications or different

264
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,399
uh

265
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,399
approaches to protect uh ai applications

266
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,200
and

267
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
now even after more than 4000 research

268
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
papers published we still don't have any

269
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,880
um

270
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,800
uh proper protection from those types of

271
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,640
attacks so it's really

272
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
a

273
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
critical problem

274
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
and it's

275
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,800
it's still a big problem

276
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,880
so what what are we talking about what

277
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,560
are the the attacks uh in in ai uh

278
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,760
we uh we try to create some kind of

279
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,519
awasp top 10

280
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
um

281
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
list of attacks on our ai systems based

282
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
on the number of

283
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
research papers published

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
about those types of attacks so

285
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
the first one is evasion when we

286
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,519
are trying to uh bypass a normal

287
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
behavior of ai system

288
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,839
uh like

289
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
uh

290
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,079
misclassify a

291
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
dog with cat and something uh we have

292
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
poisoning attack uh this is where we

293
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
uh inject some uh data into the training

294
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,120
set

295
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
uh we have membership inference attacks

296
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,560
uh where we can disclose uh the

297
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
information of uh if this particular

298
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
uh data

299
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,200
example was in the training set

300
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
um

301
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
back doors

302
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,800
like a

303
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
similar concept

304
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
uh as in traditional systems

305
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,800
model extraction attacks are attacks

306
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,279
uh to extract

307
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,320
the

308
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
uh model algorithms

309
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,560
uh attributing inference attacks it's uh

310
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,360
like disclosing information uh some kind

311
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
of critical information

312
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,200
about the data

313
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,480
uh trojans it's a kind of backdoors but

314
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,839
more uh

315
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,880
like if you if vectors are

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,480
uh

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,200
if you have some access to data and the

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
model so the trojans is basically when

319
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
you can inject some

320
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,519
malicious behavior

321
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,760
in already trained

322
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,440
system

323
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,760
model inversion attacks

324
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
uh when you can find

325
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,279
uh information about the data

326
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,160
entire water making attacks like bypass

327
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
protection controls and for

328
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
copyrightings etc

329
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
and reprogramming uh one of the most

330
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,800
interesting uh

331
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
types of attacks like we

332
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,639
uh

333
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,680
actually repurpose ai models

334
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,399
to

335
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,160
execute like different tasks

336
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
so this is the very brief list of um

337
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
most common attacks

338
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,120
and

339
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,680
uh since the patient attack is the most

340
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,160
uh popular one let me briefly describe

341
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,120
you what

342
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,760
what it is so basically we have for

343
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
example the image classified

344
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,519
classifier

345
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,880
and

346
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,040
we have an image of peak and we want

347
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,920
this image to be classified by ai as

348
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,279
something else

349
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,560
uh the the typical way in in a very high

350
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
high level is to understand what are the

351
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
most

352
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,199
uh

353
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
critic

354
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,639
important pixels

355
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
uh and then

356
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
change those pixels in a such way that

357
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,440
uh it won't be

358
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
uh

359
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,160
uh it will be imperceptible for humans

360
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
but it will change the uh

361
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,519
behavior of ai algorithm and there are

362
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
many uh

363
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,240
different

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,040
ways how to like mathematically

365
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,839
calculate

366
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,600
the uh the

367
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
amount of changes and actually the

368
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,920
the

369
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,560
the the pixels itself that you

370
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
have to change

371
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
um

372
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
and this is not just an academia uh

373
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
there were

374
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
uh a lot of uh

375
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,959
research papers devoted to the real

376
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,120
software not just only the some uh ml

377
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
algorithms so

378
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
here you can see the

379
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
the huge list of uh different types of

380
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
uh real applications

381
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
which were

382
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
uh

383
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
somehow uh bypassed uh because of the

384
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,880
vulnerabilities in ei systems

385
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,079
um

386
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
and also we already

387
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
saw a lot of

388
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,839
uh real attacks by

389
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
some

390
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,800
malicious actors

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,680
and here's here's a big list of of them

392
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,240
like uh infection of

393
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
microsoft board

394
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
uh evasion of spam detection systems

395
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
uh

396
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
different manipulations of

397
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
search engines it's a very old

398
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
thing

399
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,759
so attacks on the uh flash recognitions

400
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
for uh tax fraud

401
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
uh and so on

402
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,920
so

403
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
all this uh

404
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
information

405
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
uh

406
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,399
it's it's really a sign to

407
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,199
uh

408
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,759
devote more attention to

409
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
some kind of uh

410
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,040
testing for uh ai systems for

411
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,279
vulnerabilities and

412
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,399
the the new term uh

413
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
uh was created uh we were called ai red

414
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
teaming um so basically it's kind of

415
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,360
penetration testing but for

416
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
ai systems uh and there are like

417
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,640
regular security uh

418
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,520
teams who exploring the

419
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,880
uh

420
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
field of uh

421
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,720
ai red teaming

422
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,679
uh

423
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,599
there are air teams in uh

424
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,799
some ai development company

425
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,160
uh to test the systems internally

426
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,720
and there are air like specially

427
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
dedicated air teams are offering ai

428
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,640
security advisor like like we do

429
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
uh and more and more companies uh

430
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
currently have dedicated air teams like

431
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
facebook microsoft uh media

432
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,919
open ai and so on

433
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
so uh

434
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
you can find uh

435
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
more details on like

436
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
high level information about ai

437
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
vulnerabilities in in our report called

438
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
which was called uh

439
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520
the roar to secure trusted ai

440
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,600
uh and here we collected information

441
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
on uh

442
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,559
10 years of research

443
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,360
in this area

444
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,200
so let's

445
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,160
jump into the more uh practical part

446
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
uh like

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,200
basically the ai red teaming

448
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
and let's start with some air teaming

449
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,520
scenario like how to basically uh

450
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,679
perform it

451
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,400
uh and let's start with the problem

452
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
so as i already mentioned uh we have

453
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
currently over 4 000

454
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
research papers in the field of

455
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
adversarial machine learning

456
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,919
and every day we have like five to ten

457
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:52,799
uh

458
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,840
more research papers in this area and

459
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,559
they

460
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
they are more and more

461
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,200
complex so uh

462
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
the the second problem is that

463
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,480
it's we have a countless

464
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
number of different

465
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
uh conditions and combinations

466
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
uh on which those research papers were

467
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,440
uh conducted so for example like

468
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,840
one research paper is telling you that

469
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
this algorithm

470
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,720
uh

471
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
can be vulnerable to this vulnerability

472
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,039
uh

473
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,559
uh in

474
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,880
uh this environment

475
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
and another algorithm telling you about

476
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
the same vulnerability but in other

477
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
environments so you cannot really like

478
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,160
compare it so there are no like

479
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,320
um

480
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,080
uh

481
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
good uh

482
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
databases and comparisons and statistics

483
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
and so on to understand like

484
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919
what kind of vulnerabilities are real

485
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,600
what kind of vulnerabilities are just

486
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
like research papers

487
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
uh and so on and the other problem like

488
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,400
there are no real uh real understanding

489
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,760
of if those uh

490
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
potential of vulnerabilities

491
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,840
uh

492
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,799
are transferable to the real world

493
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
applications

494
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,480
you know so we decided to propose our

495
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
own approach

496
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,039
how to

497
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,200
test the ai systems and be sure that we

498
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
covered

499
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,159
the the most

500
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,760
uh

501
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
possible

502
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,679
ways to

503
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
attack so it's basically our

504
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
uh

505
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
say uh

506
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,039
ai threat model

507
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,240
so first

508
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
step in the ai threat model is to choose

509
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
the attack goal like what you want to

510
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
achieve

511
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,400
uh

512
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
so for example we take the facial

513
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
recognition system

514
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
and what we can do we can like produce

515
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
the confidence uh

516
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
reduce the confidence

517
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,559
uh

518
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
we can uh

519
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
miss

520
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,039
create misclassification like to avoid

521
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,720
person detection

522
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,559
uh or we can make targeted

523
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
misclassification like to pretend to be

524
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
another person

525
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,039
so

526
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
for example uh let's say we choose

527
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,880
our goal as a target misclassification

528
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
the next step is to choose the attack

529
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,440
form

530
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,320
uh

531
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,280
and it depends on the

532
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
on the threat model uh it depends on the

533
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,600
what kind of uh flash recognition system

534
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
you want to bypass is it's like a

535
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
airport system is it a

536
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,600
online banking system

537
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
um

538
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,919
so it depends like what kind of uh

539
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
physical patch or digital patch you can

540
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,159
apply

541
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,240
because sometimes you can

542
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
wear glasses sometimes you can't wear

543
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,799
glasses uh

544
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
and you need to create something

545
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,840
more complex some sometimes you can have

546
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,640
a

547
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
band aid and it's okay

548
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
so

549
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,679
the next step is to choose the form

550
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
depending on your uh

551
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
thread model

552
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
next uh

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,520
we should understand what who is a uh

554
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
a potential attack actor

555
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
uh if attacker have some access to model

556
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
if attacker can have some access to api

557
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,679
or uh he can have access to device and

558
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,799
not more

559
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,080
and

560
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
it so we either have a white box testing

561
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
or grey box testing or black box testing

562
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
uh in our particular example we decided

563
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
that we have a black box testing because

564
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,559
we like

565
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,440
uh

566
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,840
we just had access to

567
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,480
like device but we have no

568
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,039
information about the

569
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,559
algorithms and and so on

570
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,480
uh then you have to choose attack

571
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,240
conditions

572
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
uh

573
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,320
like

574
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,439
the environment

575
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,960
so it can be digital environment like um

576
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,760
uh some online system

577
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,280
uh and

578
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,159
in an online system uh

579
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
our goal is to

580
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,360
uh avoid whereas pre-processing of

581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
things like compression clipping and so

582
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,559
on

583
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
uh it can be physical environment like

584
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,760
3d

585
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,279
so uh

586
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,000
we should take care about the printing

587
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
issues because if you construct

588
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,360
the

589
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,279
uh attack like

590
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,520
uh glasses

591
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
uh

592
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,600
you test them on the digital world but

593
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
when you print them the colors may

594
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,559
change and they can may change like

595
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,279
completely and your attack will not work

596
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,919
and if your attack doesn't work in the

597
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
physical world it doesn't mean that it's

598
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
not possible it just mean that you

599
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,880
uh

600
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
did not pay

601
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
attention

602
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,000
to this printing issues

603
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
so if you don't do that you may have a

604
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
false sense of security that yeah i just

605
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,840
printed those glasses but they doesn't

606
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,799
work

607
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
in the physical world so this is not the

608
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,720
attack is not possible

609
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,080
no it can be possible but you have to do

610
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,240
uh we have you have to take into account

611
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
that there are printing issues

612
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,760
um

613
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,720
or

614
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,679
if it's a dynamic physical environment

615
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,480
uh

616
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
if you

617
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,279
need to move

618
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
uh your head if you if you need to if

619
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,440
you have a different uh

620
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,159
angles if you have different type of

621
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,960
light different environment

622
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,000
uh

623
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
all those things are

624
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
uh

625
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,480
affecting your uh

626
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,080
let's say exploit in in our case like

627
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,559
glasses are the exploit

628
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
so you you have to choose your attack

629
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
conditions

630
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,720
um

631
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,679
so then and only then and it's like a

632
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,320
final step you can choose the actual

633
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,360
method

634
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
uh for your attack and there are

635
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
different methods

636
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
uh

637
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,400
they are usually like different

638
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
mathematical

639
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
algorithms how to

640
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
um

641
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
find the

642
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,919
proper

643
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,640
uh pixels to change how to construct

644
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,279
this patch in such a way that it will

645
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,480
bypass the system so here you can see

646
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,600
like

647
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,440
some of the uh most common uh attack

648
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
methods

649
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
uh but uh pay attention that there are

650
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,360
hundreds of other methods and

651
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,039
i mean even

652
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,159
like in the time between

653
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
recording my presentation

654
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,919
and you

655
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,559
uh looking at this presentation i

656
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,679
guarantee

657
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,480
uh

658
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,919
that there will be at least one or two

659
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,200
new methods

660
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,480
published

661
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
so it's really a

662
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,200
very emerging area

663
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
uh

664
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
and finally

665
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,440
um

666
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,159
there are three success criterias for

667
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,360
your attack

668
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
uh

669
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,480
like first one is of course

670
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,559
misclassification like the attack

671
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,640
success rate like how your

672
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,679
potential attack is uh working is it

673
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
possible to achieve the goal the second

674
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,120
is imperceptibility like

675
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,360
how difficult to detect

676
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
this uh attack uh by humans or by

677
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
some algorithms uh and transferability

678
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,480
like uh how stable this attack

679
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
in changing environment or

680
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,279
if you try to apply

681
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,240
uh

682
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
attack that was constructed on

683
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
uh one system if you try the same attack

684
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,520
on the other system so how transferable

685
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,960
is your attack

686
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,559
um

687
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,600
so

688
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
what we achieved uh

689
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,919
is the attack that is

690
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,880
transferable uh

691
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,480
very uh

692
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,279
have very good misclassification rate

693
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
and uh

694
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,799
kind of

695
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,760
uh

696
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,600
imperceptible

697
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,360
uh and

698
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
in the slide you can see the uh

699
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,399
some article about the

700
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,240
uh

701
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,200
our previous attack in the digital world

702
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
so you can see uh the photo of

703
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,840
journalist

704
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,559
which we slightly changed

705
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
and then we

706
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,159
checked

707
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,279
this photo on primeise

708
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,399
it's a

709
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
face search engine

710
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
and when we put his photo on the face

711
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
search engine uh it's

712
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,399
uh

713
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,120
this search engine decided that he is uh

714
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
mark zuckerberg

715
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,600
uh

716
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,159
so it was uh

717
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,440
uh done intentionally so we changed his

718
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,799
uh photo in such way that system the

719
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,559
fashion recognitions search engine

720
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,799
decided he's

721
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,679
mark zuckerberg

722
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,320
so as a home task you can uh

723
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
guess uh

724
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
who is on this photo so

725
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,760
this is screenshot from the uh hack in

726
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,120
the box conference and you can see that

727
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,240
it's me on the photo but

728
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
some facial recognition systems will

729
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,679
think that it's

730
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,480
uh

731
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,799
somebody else

732
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,520
okay so that was a a a digital attack

733
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,279
which is uh

734
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,399
uh

735
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,479
impressive but we decided to

736
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,640
make a further steps and

737
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
test physical facial recognition systems

738
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
um and it started with uh

739
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
basically the um

740
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
one of the engagements where uh the

741
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,919
physical security solution provider

742
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,720
uh

743
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,000
asked us to test their uh

744
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
slash recognition

745
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,520
software and hardware

746
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,559
so our goal was to demonstrate uh

747
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,279
that the threat is real

748
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
uh and we wanted to achieve

749
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,720
a number of goals like

750
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,559
first it must work in the physical

751
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,120
environment

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
then it's

753
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,240
it must be transferable

754
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
as a it's a it's a black box attack so

755
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,720
uh the goal was to construct

756
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
the

757
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,559
physical attack on the facial

758
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,000
recognition system

759
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,880
that can be transferable to

760
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,360
uh other facial recognition systems so

761
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
we had no

762
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,600
uh knowledge on what kind of algorithm

763
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,080
they use we only uh

764
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,200
had

765
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
uh

766
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
our own uh

767
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,399
facial recognition engines that we

768
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
downloaded from the internet

769
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
and we tested all of our attacks on on

770
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
them

771
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,720
uh and the third goal or

772
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
we tried to make it

773
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,520
uh

774
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,240
imperceptible as much as possible uh

775
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,360
like

776
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
but it was not the

777
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,039
the final not the the main goal

778
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,399
um

779
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,200
so as for existing research

780
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
there were

781
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
around 100

782
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
research papers on

783
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,799
various attacks on facial recognition

784
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,000
some of the uh potential uh

785
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,159
potential attacks uh

786
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
were mentioned in me in media

787
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,360
uh

788
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
but there were no

789
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,279
uh practical

790
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,480
uh live demos that they

791
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,519
really can work in the physical world

792
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,320
uh and there are no like code

793
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
uh that can prove

794
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,559
that it's really working

795
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,120
and as i said before uh

796
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,399
we wanted

797
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,320
uh this to work not only uh in uh

798
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,799
in the white box scenario but also to be

799
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,840
transferable

800
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,720
uh

801
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
so why it's important to test in the

802
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,720
real environment because reality is like

803
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
it's much more complicated than uh lab

804
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
conditions

805
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,240
uh there are different uh camera

806
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,039
environment and pre-processing features

807
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,799
and all that should be taken into

808
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,320
account

809
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
and as i previously mentioned so if you

810
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,559
just try to to

811
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,559
transfer

812
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,760
a digital attack to physical world it

813
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,919
may not work and you may have false

814
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,279
sense of security that it doesn't work

815
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,080
uh

816
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,399
so what are the uh the main environment

817
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,000
conditions

818
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
uh first of all it's uh in what uh some

819
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,440
environment things like uh lights and

820
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,679
brightness and distance to objects you

821
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
if you should take into account it

822
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,640
when you construct the

823
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
patch they exploit

824
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,440
uh

825
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,000
then we have device features

826
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,799
uh of of camera itself like uh

827
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,080
resolution quality and color rendering

828
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,880
and believe me the color rendering is

829
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,960
can uh can break like most of your

830
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,720
uh attacks because a lot of cameras like

831
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,960
uh

832
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,159
have a very different color red

833
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,200
rendering

834
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,120
and you may have a

835
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,519
a red color but it can it will recognize

836
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,159
this color as a pink color and all your

837
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
efforts to construct the adversarial

838
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,519
patch

839
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,600
uh will not work

840
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
and also there are pre-processing

841
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
features like different codex

842
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,480
compressions

843
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,440
and data data transfer compressions and

844
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,760
so on

845
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
so

846
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,200
a few approaches um

847
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
how

848
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
you can work with such

849
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,399
problems

850
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,799
so you can use some uh

851
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
fine function for

852
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,960
a big pixel difference when you

853
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
construct the attack

854
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,399
uh you can train your attack take into

855
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,918
account that

856
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,879
that

857
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,119
uh there can be very

858
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,440
various sizes and angles

859
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
of your uh patch

860
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,639
you can act or subtract color changes as

861
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,399
for example as i previously mentioned

862
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,199
that

863
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,000
there is a camera that

864
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,879
think that red is pink so you may take

865
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
into account this

866
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,040
while constructing the patch it may work

867
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,679
but it's not transferable

868
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,280
uh cheat but it uh you can achieve some

869
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,399
uh

870
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,320
something with with this

871
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,760
uh you can use some gaussian blur

872
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,560
generation eye to be more transferable

873
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
or

874
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,079
color randomization and so on so there

875
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,879
are

876
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,280
different ways how to

877
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,960
overcome the environment things

878
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,760
so

879
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
uh

880
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,599
the working combo and it's one of the

881
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
possible working compass

882
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,800
that worked for us

883
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
you can see the

884
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,320
many examples that we tried and

885
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,520
um

886
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
you can see the one

887
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,240
example with the physical glasses that

888
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,839
actually worked uh in our case

889
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,440
uh

890
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
and

891
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,920
here are the

892
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
the tricks

893
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,800
so for a better accuracy

894
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,839
uh

895
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,200
we choose

896
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
uh

897
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,160
to

898
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
calculate uh adversarial attack

899
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,440
uh on each layer of neural network uh

900
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,280
and we use deep full algorithm for that

901
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
uh

902
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,839
then uh we use the ensemble of networks

903
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,280
uh to train our model so we train

904
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
oh to train our attack

905
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,200
we try to uh perform it on the ensemble

906
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,520
of models

907
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,320
simultaneously so

908
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,800
the idea is like the more

909
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,680
uh

910
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,920
models you try to

911
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
uh attack

912
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,320
the

913
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
more

914
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,560
accurate and transferable will be your

915
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,880
exploit

916
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
then for better transferability um

917
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
we used uh random noise while we

918
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,000
constructed the patch

919
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
uh

920
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
and the other thing which is uh

921
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,440
very important

922
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
uh in fashion recognition system you you

923
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
not only have a

924
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
face recognition you also have a phase

925
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,400
detection

926
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,760
uh it's also neural network which work

927
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
before fascia recognition

928
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
uh and

929
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,599
basically you need to attack two neural

930
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:56,720
networks

931
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
uh

932
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
so you need to attack one neural network

933
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
but in such way that the first neural

934
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,079
network

935
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,440
uh

936
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,520
will work and basically detect your face

937
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,640
and detect your face properly so your

938
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,839
attack

939
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,680
uh should not

940
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,160
uh break your attack on the second

941
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,920
neural network should not break the

942
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,400
functionality of first neural network

943
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,240
so it's like a chain of attacks and to

944
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,440
better transfer ability across different

945
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,040
uh phase detection engines uh we have we

946
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,280
use different uh

947
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
phase frames

948
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,760
to uh transfer between different uh

949
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
phase detection engines

950
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,560
uh

951
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,040
for better uh imperceptibility in the

952
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,920
physical world uh we use two things the

953
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
smoothing

954
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,000
functions so that the colors will be

955
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,359
more smooth

956
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,680
and more uh

957
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,520
realistic and we

958
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
we use black and white

959
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
glasses because

960
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,880
in uh

961
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,920
some of the previous research papers uh

962
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,760
the glasses were

963
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,640
uh

964
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
they had uh

965
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
some acid colors

966
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,800
and

967
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,320
that's obvious uh that if you have such

968
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
uh

969
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
acid color glasses

970
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
that's something wrong

971
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
uh

972
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,599
so we try to avoid that and uh

973
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,960
create the black and white glasses and

974
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,200
it it works so you don't have to

975
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,480
have a color exploit basically

976
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
uh black and white

977
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
also can work

978
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,839
so

979
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,560
here is the uh

980
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,349
[Music]

981
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,100
okay so uh

982
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,400
[Music]

983
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,079
i was inspired by tik tok videos and uh

984
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,160
the latest song so

985
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
sorry for this stupid music music uh

986
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,200
intro but here you can see that it's a

987
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,040
real um

988
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,839
physical attack

989
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,960
uh it works in the physical world uh

990
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,000
you can

991
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,400
uh just you can smile so you can do

992
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
different activities with your face in

993
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,359
such way that you basically can

994
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,640
bypass

995
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,839
the

996
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,160
biometric systems with liveless

997
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,800
detection uh because those systems can

998
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,680
ask you for to make a smile to blink

999
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,599
eyes to

1000
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,520
shake head a little bit so all this

1001
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,560
possible

1002
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,240
uh with this physical example

1003
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,119
so yeah results are first of all

1004
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,720
we successfully fold the effect

1005
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,320
recognition system

1006
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,599
secondly uh glasses have uh

1007
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,079
the best mystification rate but

1008
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
uh other patches are

1009
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,680
also possible

1010
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,119
uh

1011
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,000
the

1012
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,240
exploit also work even in uh men to

1013
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,480
woman combinations so

1014
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,520
in the in this uh slide you can see the

1015
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,560
uh other example where we which we

1016
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
changed the the guy to

1017
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
jk rowling and the further optimization

1018
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,520
is also possible so we can make uh

1019
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,319
glasses a little bit smaller and

1020
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,000
and so on but it was out of scope

1021
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,640
uh well um

1022
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,200
let's talk about defenses

1023
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,119
um

1024
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
first of all

1025
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
uh the biggest problem

1026
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,640
it's not as i said before it's not a sql

1027
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,880
injection where you

1028
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,359
know how to protect

1029
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,680
and it's not that like a one sql

1030
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,839
injection it's

1031
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,720
um

1032
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,920
hundreds

1033
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
thousands of

1034
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,680
injection uh injection vulnerabilities

1035
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,119
uh in the model so uh um i mean that

1036
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,160
you can create a patch

1037
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,280
uh

1038
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,640
to detect

1039
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,079
or to bike

1040
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,800
uh

1041
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,079
to detect

1042
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,960
the glasses that we created like this

1043
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,119
particular example but i can create the

1044
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,400
new ones

1045
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
and they will bypass the ai algorithm

1046
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,240
and so on so it's not that easy to

1047
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,560
protect even if you have exploit

1048
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,040
secondly there are no

1049
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,800
one-size-fits-all

1050
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,319
protections

1051
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,119
uh

1052
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,000
for

1053
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
your ai algorithm because

1054
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,680
there are different threat models

1055
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,240
so if we talk about the

1056
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,800
digital apis

1057
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
attacks can be

1058
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,359
like small changes to a face image

1059
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,119
as you saw in the

1060
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,640
first example

1061
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,079
if you have physical uh attack uh

1062
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
it's glasses so those are

1063
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
different types of attacks

1064
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,240
and

1065
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,520
there should be different types of

1066
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,920
defenses depending on your

1067
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,660
application and your threat model

1068
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,760
[Music]

1069
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,640
and third there are no hundred percent

1070
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,520
reliable protections because

1071
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,560
uh

1072
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,119
you must test various combinations of

1073
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,160
potential defenses and you must accept

1074
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,240
potential trade-offs so

1075
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,760
sometimes

1076
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,640
uh if you have

1077
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,800
some uh

1078
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,079
patch for your neural network

1079
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,760
to protect from this attack in it may

1080
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,560
affect the overall accuracy of

1081
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,440
uh

1082
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,359
your ml system

1083
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,720
so

1084
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,880
it's a trade-off

1085
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,200
okay so but what we can do

1086
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,160
um

1087
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,359
there are three uh high-level uh

1088
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,880
approaches

1089
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,760
uh

1090
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,079
to protect uh the system

1091
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,680
uh you can modify your training phase

1092
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,359
like

1093
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,880
create make adversarial training also

1094
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,359
basically you can add the adversarial

1095
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,839
examples to your training data set

1096
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,319
um the other thing you can modify the

1097
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,839
model itself

1098
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,640
use different activation functions

1099
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,520
uh

1100
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,400
different types of layers and do

1101
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,880
some tricks in the

1102
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,800
ml system

1103
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,079
this very uh it's kind of hard uh

1104
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,720
especially if you want to

1105
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,839
be sure that the other functionality

1106
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
won't be broken after

1107
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,040
uh

1108
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
this modification

1109
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,240
and other way is to modify the the

1110
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,640
inputs like do some kind of

1111
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,160
pre-processing jpeg encoding compression

1112
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,040
any other things like before uh before

1113
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,960
your model

1114
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,460
um

1115
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,880
[Music]

1116
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
so what we can say about those

1117
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,040
approaches uh

1118
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,079
at the high level of course because uh

1119
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,560
there are different ways

1120
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,000
uh and you should test it but

1121
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,640
uh modifying training

1122
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,599
uh is expensive way

1123
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,880
because you have to add a lot of uh

1124
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,640
adversarial cases it may be even more

1125
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,359
cases than the number of uh

1126
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,480
real cases so you can multiply

1127
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,119
your training time

1128
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,000
uh

1129
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,119
and your

1130
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,280
training costs by

1131
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,400
at least two

1132
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,280
or

1133
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,079
ten

1134
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,520
on average

1135
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,200
uh and

1136
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,880
also the

1137
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,440
this approach can be bypassed because

1138
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
you can generate the other adversarial

1139
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,839
example

1140
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,800
uh on trend network

1141
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
uh you can modify models uh but the

1142
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
problem is it may lead to decreased

1143
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,359
accuracy and

1144
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,079
uh other problems that you

1145
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,319
don't even have a way to detect

1146
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,359
uh and you can modify inputs uh it's

1147
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,960
it's uh probably the best one of the

1148
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,040
best approaches but

1149
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,079
it's complicated and it's task specific

1150
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,760
so if you create some algorithm to

1151
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
detect and and modify inputs for

1152
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,920
facial recognition system it may not

1153
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,240
transfer

1154
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,119
even to phase detection system and i'm

1155
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,560
not saying that

1156
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,799
uh

1157
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,480
and

1158
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,000
it's hard to transfer between like other

1159
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,800
types of systems

1160
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,760
so as you can see all types of defenses

1161
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,720
have their advantages and disadvantages

1162
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
uh but what you can do

1163
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
uh is to

1164
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
implement some kind of secure ai

1165
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,319
lifecycle

1166
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,200
uh

1167
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,880
and start with awareness like

1168
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,720
educate stakeholders in the ai and

1169
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,000
security teams that the threats are uh

1170
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,040
real

1171
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,920
and study relevant policies and

1172
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,160
practices

1173
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,280
to secure

1174
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,480
your ai

1175
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,839
then uh you can perform initial threat

1176
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,880
monitoring to understand risks

1177
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,839
and you can use our threat modeling that

1178
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
was presented in

1179
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,119
in this um

1180
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,480
in this talk

1181
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,359
and

1182
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,839
then you can conduct the uh

1183
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,960
initial

1184
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,720
air teaming

1185
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,839
uh for mission critical ai systems

1186
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,440
um

1187
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,000
but the the most important part is the

1188
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,520
assurance so

1189
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,640
then

1190
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,760
understand then uh respond to

1191
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,520
uh the findings

1192
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,960
uh and most importantly uh integrate

1193
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,359
those activities in in your ai

1194
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,520
development life cycle

1195
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,280
so that it won't be just a one uh

1196
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,920
uh one-time job it should be a

1197
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,800
a life cycle

1198
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,280
where you continuously uh analyze it

1199
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,880
so the next steps uh

1200
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,800
there are a few things

1201
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,920
which i recommend is first like

1202
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,960
uh educate your uh ai and security teams

1203
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,280
uh perform initial threat modeling

1204
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,040
uh

1205
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,280
test your system like conduct error

1206
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,319
teaming

1207
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,640
understand uh security findings and

1208
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,200
integrate them into your yeah security

1209
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,480
lifecycle

1210
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,079
um

1211
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,440
so thanks for for listening and uh

1212
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,640
i hope you

1213
