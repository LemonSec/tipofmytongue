1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,240
uh i think we have zing yu jin and

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
richard neal

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,519
in the studio with us

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
hey guys can you hear us here

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,960
[Music]

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,039
hey guys how's things going man

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,960
fantastic oh yeah

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,640
thanks for joining us man amazing

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
presentation very nice stuff

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,039
thank you i think there's a little bit

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,440
of a of a time like in between the time

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
talking so i'll give a bit of space for

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
you guys to hear me and then answer okay

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
i'm guessing you guys can hear me right

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,239
yeah okay just checking just checking uh

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,680
so just

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
looking at your presentation that you

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,440
guys um

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
just did

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,320
you mentioned that an external

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,039
researcher reported three lines of code

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,840
uh

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
and then didn't really give any kind of

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
additional information how often does

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
this happen i mean like do you guys get

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
a lot of reports where there's just

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,400
here's a von

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
i don't have any idea how to reproduce

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
it have fun

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
um

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,240
it depends yes that does happen

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
sometimes people

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,720
sometimes people will do a report

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,479
with a good writer and a proof of

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,960
concept sometimes they just say there's

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
a vulnerability here

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,320
um i think the reward programs do pay

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
more if you submit a proof of concept

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,439
but i it just depends whether the

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,600
researcher wants to do the extra work or

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
not

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,479
so on a scale i mean like between one

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
and ten cases right how often do you

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
guys see this happening as in like a

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
researcher just gives you guys some kind

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
of like findings without any proof of

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,840
concept and you guys have to make it up

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
yourself as in like you know build a

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
chain yourself

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,399
um

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
to say i'd guess

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
probably potentially thirty percent

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
twenty thirty percent pretty high man i

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,719
would have thought it's more uh rare

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,399
than that right like not not that

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
regular i mean thirty percent is one out

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,520
of three right so that's that's really

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,280
regular but

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,679
yeah i mean

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
it it does depend a lot a lot of people

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
who submit

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
there are some researchers who submit a

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,720
lot of things and they generally

64
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
they generally give a lot of details

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
with it

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
um

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
it tends to be some of the newer

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
less regular ones that may maybe give

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
less information

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
uh i'm not sure if you guys caught uh

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
mark doud's keynote this morning did you

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
guys manage to take a look at that

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,959
probably not okay no volume anyway

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,400
basically he was talking about the state

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
of mobile security and like you know how

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
the defensive state has moved for ios

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
right and we had asked him a question as

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,160
in

79
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
uh is apple kind of ahead of the game as

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
in like does android have any similar

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
defensive mechanisms in place either

82
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
already implemented or coming down the

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,920
pipeline say in the next couple of

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
months

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
that offers similar kind of uh or

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
protections

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
maybe you guys can talk a little bit

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
about like you know overall android

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
ecosystem and and how you guys are

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
defending against like future attacks

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
well yeah um we we mentioned in the

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,280
program the generic kernel image project

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
um

94
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,519
that the intention of that is to get

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,760
kernel updates onto user devices more

96
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,080
rapidly than is currently the case

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
that by providing a single kernel image

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,879
refresh centrally there's less work for

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,400
everybody to do

100
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
importing security patches to all the

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
different trees

102
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,959
so hopefully that should result in

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,840
more frequent kernel updates and hence

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
better application of security patches

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
across the ecosystem

106
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
uh

107
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,319
i mean i

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
what what what what other things are you

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
sort of thinking about here

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
uh let me just pull up mark's kind of

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
slides but i mean basically he's just

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
kind of talking about how like the

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,319
evolution of like attackers and i in a

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
way like memory corruption bugs are kind

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
of like on the way out

116
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,280
and like you know now the the attack

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,200
surface kind of shifted

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
and you know how

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,238
you know organizations have taken a

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
proactive role in kind of like closing

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
the gap to make defensive more or make

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
it harder to exploit basically right

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,280
like so are there any kind of

124
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
implementations you guys are working on

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
yeah well i mean i'm sure you've seen

126
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,880
the uh

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,680
media recording about use of rust yeah

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,479
um

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,040
and android security is very keen on

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
rust

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
both for

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,240
uh

133
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,400
applications and potentially kernel

134
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
development so yeah

135
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
things are being developed in rust that

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
is being picked up by by more teams

137
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,759
internally so hopefully that as you say

138
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
will go some way to reducing memory

139
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,840
corruption vulnerabilities

140
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
um i mean

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
you you can't replace the use of c

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,479
overnight right

143
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,840
um

144
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,639
the

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
the vast majority of linux journal is

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,800
written in it so it is going to be with

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
us for some time

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,919
um but yeah we've moving

149
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
moving languages to rust where possible

150
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
you know we have quite a lot of

151
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,360
analysis tools uh

152
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
we do a lot of fuzzing on things

153
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
yeah

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,919
looking you know

155
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
race conditions undefined memory

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
accesses et cetera

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,080
so talking about fuzzing right like can

158
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
you guys uh talk a little bit about the

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
infrastructure that you guys use as in

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,560
like we know that google has like

161
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
something crazy kind of like hardware

162
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,280
and you know capabilities but when it

163
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
comes to fuzzing like can you guys shed

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
some light into like what kind of

165
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
what kind of bugs are you guys finding

166
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
or how many kind of like uh

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
crashes are you guys generating on in

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,240
general and how do you guys verify

169
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,919
whether those are exploitable or not

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
uh well personally i do a lot of human

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
review on code instead of doing first

172
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
thing but for first thing i think we

173
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
usually use

174
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
the system

175
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,039
all the customized stuff to do the first

176
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,000
thing

177
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
um

178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
that's basically

179
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
um

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
what's up doing

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,240
so far

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
so i mean like for example like i mean

183
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
mark talked about the fact that you guys

184
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,039
have found something like 29 000 bucks

185
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
in chrome since 2016 right can you guys

186
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,000
talk a little bit about the

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,919
infrastructure is it like what exactly

188
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,280
is your fuzzing engine look like and

189
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
then for an a normal researcher getting

190
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
access to this kind of like hardware

191
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
right it's kind of iron it's almost

192
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
impossible right

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600
so

194
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
could you guys talk about like how do

195
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,319
you guys set it up is it like how many

196
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,160
instances are we talking about like in

197
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,240
the cloud that uh that are constantly

198
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,039
generating samples to generate 29 000

199
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,319
bucks in chrome

200
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,960
since 2016 which is a lot

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,759
like

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,080
i i honestly do not know how big our

203
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
fuzzing infrastructure is

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,820
we thought we could get some insight

205
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,880
[Laughter]

206
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
sorry

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
yeah i mean we

208
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
we do a lot of fuzzing um

209
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
this virtualization used in fuzzing for

210
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,199
android

211
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,280
which fuzz on real devices which fuzz on

212
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
virtual devices

213
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
um

214
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,560
yeah for chrome

215
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
we have a lot of server hardware but i'm

216
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,120
i'm afraid i have no idea exactly how

217
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
much

218
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
can you guys share with us like how big

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,440
the team is as in let's just say if you

220
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
produce like the fuzzing team right like

221
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
in all of the the crashes that get

222
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,199
outputted from the system let's just

223
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
call it a black box that outputs this is

224
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
a possible crash who does the

225
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,479
verification that whether is it

226
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,319
exploitable or not or how many people

227
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
are involved with that now is it a small

228
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
group is it a large group is it

229
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
automated

230
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
i mean

231
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
each each group will look at their own

232
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
crashes so

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,879
for chrome those will go to chrome for

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,440
android those go to a let's go to an

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,639
android tv review etc so there are a lot

236
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,199
of different teams looking at the output

237
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,240
um

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,479
the teams will vary in size they

239
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,319
once the initial triage is being done

240
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,000
they can obviously call on

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
the development team responsible for

242
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
that area of the code to go and

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
investigate further so it's not

244
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
necessarily

245
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
one specific team doing the work and

246
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
looking at the output yes there will be

247
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,680
people who triage the crashes

248
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
but then it goes a lot more widely

249
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
across everybody else basically to fix

250
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
bugs in the account

251
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
um yeah but also first thing the android

252
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
device is

253
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
kind of difficult because there are a

254
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,120
lot of oem with different hardware so

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,599
virtualization for this hardware like

256
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,799
the white driver if it doesn't work

257
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
so in terms of like when you guys

258
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
looking for talent for example right

259
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,000
like joining project zero like how would

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
somebody go about doing that and then do

261
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
they send you guys some kind of cool

262
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
exploit zero days and then you guys hire

263
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
them from there like how does it work i

264
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,000
don't think there's a traditional

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,640
interview right

266
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,399
[Music]

267
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
oh yeah

268
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,040
well i mean

269
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,880
we obviously advertise

270
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
uh open positions

271
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
um

272
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
so people can apply um

273
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
i i don't know exactly how project zero

274
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
recruit obviously we know some people on

275
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,279
project zero um

276
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,360
a lot of people on project zero are very

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,320
well known security researchers so yeah

278
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
i i wouldn't expect having a having a

279
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
public profile

280
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
that helps significantly there if you

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
can if you can back up what you say

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,920
there's a lot of evidence

283
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
but yeah we we post vacancies

284
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
uh on on the google website all the

285
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,080
teams do

286
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
uh

287
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,920
people people sending their people

288
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
sending their details

289
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
their you know applications are screened

290
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
and then they will go through a number

291
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
of interviews with

292
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
with people like us essentially to talk

293
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
about their skills and experience work

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
through some problems

295
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
uh

296
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,360
and see if we like them and they like us

297
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
it's still the same we'll say what kind

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
of style right like nothing much has

299
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,240
changed as it was right

300
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
yeah yeah same yeah i mean

301
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,440
recruiting somebody is quite an

302
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
investment in time for for them and us

303
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
so we've got to make sure

304
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,079
we've got the right person and they've

305
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
got to make sure they're happy with what

306
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
they're getting into

307
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,600
fair perfect apparently i mean do you

308
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,959
guys have any openings on your team

309
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
maybe the folks are watching here who

310
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,839
might want to apply are there any

311
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,000
openings at the moment or

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,670
we'll call you don't call us

313
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,550
[Laughter]

314
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,399
i don't think we've got any vacancies

315
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,720
right now um but

316
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
we are in the pre

317
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
the organization is get in the process

318
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
of going through the head count planning

319
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
at the moment so hopefully we will have

320
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
we will have some available

321
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,200
head count soon but i don't think we've

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
got anything right now

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
cool um

324
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,000
i don't think we have any questions from

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
discord let me just check

326
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,000
no we don't have any other questions

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
we've got like two more minutes man you

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,480
guys going to

329
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
wrap things up with any like takeaway

330
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
notes about

331
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,880
anything

332
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,600
in particular

333
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,839
well i think um

334
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
well one of my friends asked me like why

335
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,959
we decide to disclose our

336
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,600
vulnerability to enjoy

337
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
in public so basically like

338
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,959
we believe reviewing these details will

339
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,160
help good guys been better defense right

340
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,279
so we can also like prevent malicious

341
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,519
actor who won't go on the attack use

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,760
this one vp in the future

343
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
so in general we want to contribute to

344
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
the entire school community and be a

345
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
better defense together

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
thanks so much for for sharing your

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
thoughts i mean i think

348
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
from hanging the box side of you i mean

349
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
we always like disclosure as in the more

350
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
that we can get that information out

351
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
there the more people can kind of give

352
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
their ideas and input into it and maybe

353
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
have some new kind of insights into the

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,399
problem

355
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
uh and if we keep everything in closed

356
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
doors then that helps nobody really

357
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,519
so

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
