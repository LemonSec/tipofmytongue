[Music]

125
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
isn't it

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
so indeed those applications

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,840
have been collects our private data and

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
identify us track us

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
sometimes because those information are

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
all starting in the cloud sometimes even

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,479
though we

132
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
change to a new device or different type

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
of device

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
the

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,800
some

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
big guy still in behind to

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,360
watch us

138
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,560
so

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,639
it's well known you know application the

140
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,720
mobile application are collecting our

141
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
data and this data include a variety of

142
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,240
types

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
for example the geographic location so

144
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
they know where we are at the real time

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,520
and also the device id which can you

146
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
uniquely

147
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
identify the device

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
and same car information and sometimes

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,360
even our browsing history

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
so

151
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,000
they claim you know they're gonna use

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,199
this data for a good purpose to make our

153
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
life better

154
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,919
like you see in a video clip

155
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
so they claim they're gonna use our data

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,039
for

157
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
analytics purpose

158
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
and to enrich the application

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
functionality

160
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
and also to provide

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,199
product personalization

162
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,280
and also personalized advertisement

163
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
and here is example this is a study done

164
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,039
by apple so

165
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,440
it basically look at different messenger

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
apps and say what data do those

167
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
messenger apps collect

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
about our

169
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,280
personal

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
privacy

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
so you can find some application to

172
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
respect our privacy but some

173
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,639
do

174
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,599
a lot of excessive collection

175
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,639
so not only those

176
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
locations i just mentioned they even

177
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,560
collect our

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
purchase information

179
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,759
financial information

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
excuse me

181
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,680
in response to such you know data

182
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,880
collection

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,479
and various data protection regulations

184
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,080
and laws

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
are starting

186
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
putting place

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
so you can find

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
major countries and also regions or you

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
know

190
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,199
put in place their regulations to

191
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
protect

192
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
their

193
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
citizens

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,639
the most famous one most well-known one

195
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,840
is the

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,599
gdpr general data protection regulation

197
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,960
from europe and also uk

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,000
i mean europe uni and uk

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
so i'm gonna give you some quick

200
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,599
introduction

201
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,479
just a quick review on gdpr

202
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
the gdpr

203
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,240
came into force on may 2018 in europe

204
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,640
union countries and also

205
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,839
uk

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
and it is a major update to the eu data

207
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
protection directive

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
introduced in 1995

209
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,600
and gdpr mainly covers

210
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
six aspects

211
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
so here i um you know summarize

212
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
i mean

213
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
summarized by other researchers as well

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,240
with

215
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,320
wh and also another

216
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
two

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
global penalty so we can have a quick

218
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
look at them

219
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,200
uh what

220
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,399
so

221
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,920
gdpr

222
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,640
is a data protection regulation that

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
applies to processing personal data

224
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,399
of

225
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,120
eu and uk residents

226
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
and which

227
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
you know any information

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
relating to those citizens

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
um you know no matter they can be

230
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,080
identified directly or indirectly is on

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
the

232
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,240
range on the coverage of gdpr

233
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
and the purpose

234
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
of gdpr is to protect as i mentioned the

235
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,279
data privacy

236
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,200
of their

237
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
citizens

238
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
so it's going to prevent the data from

239
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,399
misuse and to ensure the data privacy

240
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
for the citizens

241
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,080
and how

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,880
so essentially gdpr

243
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
enforce more

244
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,920
stricter obligations to the data

245
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
controller so data controller is the

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
entities the parties who get the user

247
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,800
data

248
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,040
and

249
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
more obligations are given to them and

250
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,600
also

251
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,560
give the data owners so in context of

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,760
the mobile

253
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
the data owners means the users

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,760
themselves so gdpr i provide the rights

255
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
to the data owners to control their data

256
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
so even though the data is collected by

257
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
the controllers

258
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,120
still some

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
rights

260
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
should be preserved to the data owners

261
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,000
so the range of gdpr basically is going

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,040
to be applied to globally so not only

263
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
the eu and uk citizens but globally as

264
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
long as the entity involves the eu and

265
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
uk residents

266
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
so gdp also includes some penalty you

267
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
know any

268
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,760
uh privacy bridge is gonna be subject to

269
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,519
up to four percent

270
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,920
or 20 million euros whichever

271
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
is higher on such a higher

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,079
high fine

273
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,959
penalty from gdpr if the

274
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
user data cannot be well protected by

275
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,680
the controllers

276
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
it provides a few principles and those

277
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
principles have been used as guidelines

278
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,279
for you know those

279
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,680
policy makers or system designers

280
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
to you know

281
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
review the protection

282
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,480
so i'm gonna give you a very quick look

283
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
at them

284
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
so the first one personal information

285
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
should be processed lawfully fairly and

286
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,639
in a transparent manner

287
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
second personal information should be

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
collected

289
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
for specified explicit and legitimate

290
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
purpose

291
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
basically the data collected should only

292
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,680
be used

293
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
on the purpose

294
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,560
of you know

295
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
the like the decline to the users what

296
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
the purpose that is declared to the

297
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
users or the purpose of the

298
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,360
functionality

299
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
of the application

300
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
for example if the application is just

301
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,920
to provide some

302
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
functionality of game

303
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
there's no reason you know

304
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
they will collect a lot of you know

305
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
payment

306
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,480
uh

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,160
history about the history of the user

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
uh third principle personal information

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
should be adequate

310
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
uh relevant and limit to what is

311
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
necessary

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,519
fourth personal information should be

313
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
accurate and whenever necessary kept up

314
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
to date

315
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,760
fifth

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
the personal information should be

317
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,040
adequate pretend only for as long as

318
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,399
necessary

319
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,040
that means those data controllers should

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
should not

321
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,560
you know store the collected private

322
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
data forever they cannot do this in a

323
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
persistent or permanent way

324
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,079
uh

325
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
principle six

326
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
personal information should be processed

327
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,680
in an appropriate manner to maintain

328
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
security

329
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
that means the

330
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,800
data controllers are obligated to

331
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,680
use

332
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
some

333
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,519
you know

334
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,639
high

335
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
um

336
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,399
some high security

337
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,360
mechanisms for example encryption

338
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,399
or other access control strategy you

339
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,839
know different

340
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
technology to maintain security

341
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
and other

342
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,480
regulations from different countries

343
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
also have very similar principles so

344
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
here i use the uh you two

345
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
regulations from u.s

346
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,320
the ccpa u.s california consumer privacy

347
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,199
act

348
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,320
and also copa of u.s

349
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
children's online privacy protection

350
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,440
rule

351
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
as example to shu

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,360
so

353
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,120
you know they have very similar as i

354
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,440
mentioned very similar principles to

355
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,320
gdpr but they have different

356
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
although in different but it's quite

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,279
minor so some minor difference in terms

358
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,120
of the scope

359
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,079
the key definition some key definitions

360
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,720
legal basis and the rights and

361
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
enforcement

362
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
so here i use two

363
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,040
two aspects to show the difference

364
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
so scope gdpr

365
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,079
is applied to you know any identifier

366
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,680
i

367
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
identifiable a nature person as well as

368
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,480
you know those persons are

369
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,519
european or uk citizens is going to be

370
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
within the scope of gdpr in contrast

371
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
ccpa is

372
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,279
only for the natural person who is a

373
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,839
california resident

374
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,320
and region so you know by the name you

375
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,519
can get that

376
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,560
europe union gdpr is going to be applied

377
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
to entities or organizations

378
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,360
um you know

379
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,399
that

380
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
in the europe union so no matter that

381
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
established or not established in eu

382
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,199
as long as they are located in eu

383
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
involves business with eu

384
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
they're going to be put on into the

385
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,800
scope of gdpr

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,639
and ccpa is going to only um

387
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,079
apply to the entities who do business in

388
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
california

389
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,959
so in response to those um strict

390
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
regulations around the world

391
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,199
google also

392
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,759
enhance its

393
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,279
price privacy policies so for example

394
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,600
under google play which is the official

395
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
market of the android applications

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
so they have requirements to the

397
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
developers of application

398
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
so as long as the developer want to

399
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,839
publish their applications through

400
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
google play they need to

401
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,320
provide privacy policies

402
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,120
and

403
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
in the privacy policies

404
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,639
those uh four points i put here

405
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,560
should put in

406
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,360
a very transparent way to the

407
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
to the application users so this include

408
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
but not limited to

409
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,720
what data is going to be collected by

410
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
the application so the data types to be

411
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,320
corrected

412
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,000
and the purpose

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
of the

414
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
data so

415
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,839
what is the data going to be used for

416
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,839
and then if the data is going to be

417
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,319
shared to or transmitted to a third

418
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
party who

419
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
so this needs to be also put into the

420
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
privacy policy

421
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
and the last one how is the data

422
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,039
protected so what kind of security

423
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
mechanism

424
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
excuse me what kind of security

425
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
mechanisms is going to be applied to

426
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,439
protect the user data

427
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,880
so

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
here for example uh this is the google

429
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
place policy under you the data so

430
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
basically

431
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
those applications need to be

432
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,440
transparent

433
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,160
and how they will handle you the data

434
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,840
so this transparency means they need to

435
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,640
disclose applications access collect use

436
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,440
and sharing of the data and also

437
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
to limit the use of the data to the

438
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,280
purpose disclosed as required by the

439
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
iphone case which one the second

440
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,120
principle of gdpr

441
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,039
so

442
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,640
google uh

443
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
google play also have very

444
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,120
strict definition on a very

445
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
comprehensive definition on the personal

446
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
sensitive information

447
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
so

448
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,559
they put in

449
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
into the scope you know those

450
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,880
um

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
personal identifiable information of

452
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,240
course

453
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
like you know the device id or

454
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,480
sim card id that can be uniquely linked

455
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
to the user

456
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
that you know they call it personally

457
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
identifiable right so that can be

458
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
uniquely uh linked to the user it's

459
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
gonna be treated us personal sensitive

460
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
information

461
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,799
uh besides this those financial and

462
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,640
payment information

463
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
authentication information for mood

464
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,360
contacts location and so on so forth

465
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
also

466
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,799
be considered as

467
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,639
personal sensitive information

468
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,360
so

469
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
we analyzed a few applications who

470
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
provide their privacy policy in response

471
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,600
to the requirements of google play and

472
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,039
we basically summarize those

473
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,760
things on those aspects

474
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
that are covered by those application

475
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
so this includes

476
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,120
uh first the policy on true trans data

477
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,600
second

478
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,240
the purpose so what do the application

479
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,679
do

480
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
with the data collected

481
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
third they need to give the rights to

482
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
the user so basically what the user can

483
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
do what rights user

484
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
is going to hold

485
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,960
after the data has been given to the

486
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,320
data controller to the application

487
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
uh fourth

488
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
how and when

489
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,679
will the application share the data

490
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
collected and also to whom

491
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
uh fifth

492
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,520
the pro that will keep the user data

493
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
and also about the downloading of the

494
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,799
personal data

495
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
so

496
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,840
based on our analysis you know on the

497
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,120
regulations and also

498
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
google play privacy policies

499
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,919
we decided to

500
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,320
develop a framework

501
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
to

502
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,360
you know facilitate not only the auditor

503
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
those

504
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,400
technical people

505
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,679
but also some policy makers some

506
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,240
people from the real business

507
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,679
or

508
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,600
high-level policies

509
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,120
so

510
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,919
the motivation is for us to give this

511
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,280
framework is

512
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
you know when conducting application

513
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,480
privacy compliance audit

514
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,720
how do we ensure that

515
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,919
testing or testing or auditing covers

516
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,039
the majority so if not all majority of

517
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,039
the policy compliance issues

518
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
so this is to um

519
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,919
you know address several challenges the

520
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
first one is regulations and

521
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,840
best

522
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,360
so basically

523
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,039
if you look at the

524
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,000
document on those laws and regulated uh

525
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
regulations you can find they are really

526
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,520
very

527
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,799
high level

528
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,280
and they are kind of quite abstract

529
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,320
theoretical and complex

530
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
however

531
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,440
in practice we will need some

532
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,159
enforceable

533
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,799
items or checklists

534
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,760
so you can find there's a gap here

535
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
and we try to

536
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
close this gap

537
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,080
you know based on our study on the

538
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,039
law and regulations then devise some

539
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,960
enforceable

540
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
techniques that can be used

541
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,760
by the stakeholders

542
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,919
and second the passive active so

543
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,400
basically previously

544
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,159
uh those

545
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,039
stakeholders was like you know

546
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
application developer or device

547
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,280
manufacturers they kind of cope with the

548
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,400
privacy issues in a very passive way

549
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
that means they just say you know there

550
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,760
is a hole they're gonna go to fix it

551
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
putting results

552
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,320
but we were gonna change kind of uh

553
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,039
propose to change this situation those

554
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,520
stakeholders they should be active in

555
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,240
terms of the privacy protection

556
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,960
so

557
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,919
before like that application or device

558
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,679
are put on the market

559
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
they if they have some you know

560
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,159
something some tool some technology that

561
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,960
can help them to check the compliance of

562
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
their device application it's going to

563
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
be very useful

564
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,480
uh you know it's gonna this active way

565
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
is gonna be

566
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
helpful to them

567
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,400
uh instead of you know already

568
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,520
um

569
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
some store has already been

570
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,679
um you already have already occurs then

571
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,640
they go

572
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,200
to cope with those threads in a passive

573
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,039
way

574
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,600
and the last uh the research application

575
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,679
so we have been doing the

576
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,200
uh privacy

577
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,559
um

578
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
on the application mobile application

579
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,159
for managers

580
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,880
and we're thinking probably we should

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,760
you know really enforce our implement

582
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
our ideas or experience we learn from

583
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,159
the research from the analysis into some

584
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,400
applicable

585
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
framework applicable tools

586
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,919
so we develop our framework and we

587
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,360
provide the global view and guideline so

588
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
the global view

589
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,080
is going to be very it's a very big

590
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,600
picture

591
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,720
so we take the entire data life cycle

592
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,559
into consideration

593
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,960
and for the guideline we break it down

594
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,679
into a very low level break it down

595
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,960
to make it enforceable

596
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
and our framework includes two levels

597
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,880
the logic level

598
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
and enforcement level

599
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
so on the logic level we're going to

600
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
allow the

601
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400
decision makers to have a big picture

602
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
about the potential scenarios where the

603
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
privacy issues may occur

604
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
and on the enforcement level we're going

605
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
to give some enforceable

606
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
checklists

607
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
guidelines for the auditor or security

608
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
analyst

609
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,080
to make inspection

610
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,840
in efficient and comprehensive manner

611
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,600
so here is the data uh the logic level

612
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,360
as i mentioned we're going to take into

613
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
consideration the whole

614
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,039
data life cycle so this includes the

615
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,880
data collection

616
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,279
transmission storage and use

617
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,279
so we're going to look are you know from

618
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,120
the datatype

619
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,000
collection to the data division so this

620
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,559
whole period the whole lifecycle of the

621
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,640
data

622
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,760
and this is the logic level breakdown we

623
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,159
have different types so you can find we

624
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,440
have the

625
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
illegal collection

626
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
type of illegal collection of user data

627
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,279
and illegal use illegal transfer and

628
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,240
illegal storage of your data

629
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
and so we break down each type into

630
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,240
items

631
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,720
right first type we break down it into

632
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
uh four items

633
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
so each item we have the description to

634
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
tell the

635
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
decision maker the policy maker

636
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,360
you know the potential threats

637
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
and also we'll give the information you

638
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,000
know whether our test on this item is

639
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,360
manual or automated

640
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,440
and then for the enforcement level is

641
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
gonna be more

642
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,600
enforceable so you can find we have

643
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
different types as well the network

644
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,159
requires privacy policy application

645
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,360
permission

646
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,279
and hard codedness

647
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,960
application log

648
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,520
and also excessive

649
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,360
data request

650
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,559
so the same way breakdown into items and

651
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,279
have the description for the auditor

652
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,799
analysts to use

653
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,400
and also tell them

654
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
this need unfortunately sometimes we'll

655
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,360
need a security analyst to put in some

656
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,799
manual uh effort but well let us know

657
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,960
what is the manual effort

658
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,039
needed for the particular item

659
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,240
so here's the example on the um

660
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,159
the type of network request we have

661
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,600
three items

662
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
uh the first one is about uploading the

663
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,520
user data

664
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
and the second is on the transmission so

665
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,919
basically

666
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,480
if the data is transmitted through an

667
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
encrypted channel like http we're gonna

668
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,120
raise the alert

669
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,679
and the third is the elevation of

670
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,799
privilege

671
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,720
so this

672
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,960
involves those you know use

673
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,919
at get set or change

674
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,720
api to obtain the user sensitive data

675
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,760
and also our framework uh take into

676
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
consideration the difference

677
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,159
of their privacy policies of privacy

678
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
principles

679
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
among different countries

680
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
so as i mentioned in the very beginning

681
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,120
right like

682
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,600
between the gdpr and

683
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
u.s

684
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
regulations there's some subtle

685
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,919
difference

686
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,000
so we also you know take into

687
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
consideration such difference

688
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
uh into our framework so that those uh

689
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,320
analysis auditor from different

690
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,000
countries can

691
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,399
can use to you know target their own

692
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,000
country's regulations

693
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,120
so this is a very general overview of

694
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
the framework so now we're gonna pass to

695
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,840
gp and so you to give you more

696
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
uh technical details

697
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,120
about our framework

698
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,760
hello everyone uh i'm junction

699
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,679
now let me introduce you several

700
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,039
automatic tools in the front made by us

701
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,000
and the test results

702
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
the first one is the domain test tool

703
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,880
it can obtain all ipo addresses and the

704
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,919
domains

705
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
from the application

706
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,320
to check if they belong to trustworthy

707
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,919
entities

708
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,799
the second one is a privacy pop-up

709
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
window test tool

710
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
it can test if the application obtains

711
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,039
users privacy information before user

712
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,559
agrees to privacy policy using hook

713
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,200
the third one is

714
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,679
application scan tool

715
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,799
it can check all the apis related to the

716
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,320
privacy

717
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,200
and some certificate

718
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
problems

719
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
the last one is the traffic detection

720
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
tool

721
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,200
it can obtain all network traffic of the

722
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,480
application uh with running

723
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,360
we use this tool to check

724
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,120
the part or the privacy issue

725
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,399
okay let's go to the next speed

726
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,120
let's see some more typical privacy

727
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
information

728
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
here here is some typical price

729
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,679
information

730
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,120
in android system we use this tool to

731
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
take

732
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,679
there are three types of permission in

733
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,360
android system

734
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,559
but we

735
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,360
just focus on two of them

736
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
one is generous permission another is

737
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,320
normal permission

738
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,799
about the terrorist permission

739
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,960
you need to request the long-term

740
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,360
permission in your application before

741
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,960
you can access the restricted data or

742
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,000
perform

743
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,799
resistivity the actions

744
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,279
such as location

745
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,520
uh about the normal permission you just

746
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,159
need a needle to add data

747
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,799
in the manifest file

748
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,960
you will get the data

749
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,320
such as the wi-fi information

750
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,720
here we list the many common privacy

751
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,360
information accessories

752
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,200
some of them will surprise you

753
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,519
the first one is the android serial

754
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
number

755
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
there are four ways to guide it in

756
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,399
different android worlds

757
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,519
such as we can use the synthetic field

758
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,679
serial to get it

759
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,480
without any permission or android it

760
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,960
we can also use the function get serial

761
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,640
to get it on android

762
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,399
this function

763
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,159
is the readable state of permission

764
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,039
which is a generous permission

765
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,480
so

766
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,840
uh very surprising right

767
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,000
the second one is the wifi information

768
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,360
such as we can read the the address file

769
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,919
to get the mac address

770
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,640
and read the erp file to get the router

771
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,960
mac address

772
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,600
this will completely bypass the api

773
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,719
access requirements

774
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
what's more

775
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
there are several information

776
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,679
people offer for the tool

777
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,080
such as android ide

778
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,000
application list

779
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
under the clipboard

780
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,720
unacceptably

781
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,480
this information don't need any

782
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,039
permission to be able to read them

783
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,559
in some android worlds

784
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
clearly just talk about this information

785
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
in some android worlds there may be some

786
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,200
attendees with uh with android update

787
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,960
such as android ice

788
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
okay

789
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,120
let's go to the next speed

790
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,399
we just see some api functions

791
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,600
let's talk about the field

792
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,279
as we all know

793
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,000
there are some hookup tools to monitor

794
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,919
function calls

795
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,600
such as frida

796
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
and the exposed

797
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,200
but we can't use these tools to hook a

798
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
field call

799
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
such as

800
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,320
beyond the point serial

801
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,399
here we have done

802
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,480
automated under instrumentation

803
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,519
technology to achieve static field

804
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,159
management

805
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
let's see how we did it

806
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,080
the first step is

807
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,559
text to somali

808
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,519
then

809
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,840
add the log and the self signature

810
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,320
hooker modules to the last text

811
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,799
the second step is add the log code to

812
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,760
this pc after the field

813
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
beyond the point serial

814
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,919
then

815
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,000
we add the signature code to the

816
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,600
application class to make sure we can

817
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,120
replace the

818
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,320
original signature

819
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,279
now

820
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,440
we can we can build all the taxes

821
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
we use the new taxes

822
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,679
to replace the taxes files in the apk

823
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
finally

824
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
we can assign the apk using

825
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,760
your own signature

826
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,119
now

827
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,480
when the

828
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,040
field is used uh the logo will print

829
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,239
so we use uh we use this method to

830
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,759
monitor file call

831
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,879
okay um

832
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,879
that's it and now

833
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,839
let's bouncer you introduce you our test

834
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
results thank you

835
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
okay thank you john chi

836
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,839
and hello everyone i'm once again and

837
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,839
now let me show

838
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,000
let me introduce our

839
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
automatic 12 and some test results of

840
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,839
r12

841
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,680
and

842
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,720
we have developed a series of nam

843
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,680
servers of tools based on the privacy

844
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,119
framework

845
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,640
as junction

846
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,160
was introduced

847
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,560
just now

848
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,760
this video shows how the automatic tools

849
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,640
work

850
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,240
of monitoring the access about privacy

851
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,599
for information before agree the privacy

852
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,200
policy

853
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,839
and let's take a look at this video

854
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,079
first we made a demo to show the perfect

855
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,359
agreement

856
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,400
and

857
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,040
it will collect privacy information

858
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
such as pssid

859
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
and android id

860
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
and it collected this

861
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,040
information when builders read the

862
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,240
public privacy policy

863
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,839
okay and then

864
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,440
we use the tool to test it

865
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,200
we will run a script

866
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,200
okay it's running

867
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,680
and now our 12 captures the policy

868
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,800
privacy

869
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,200
in this demo

870
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,599
and then

871
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,440
it's monitoring api calls of the privacy

872
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,440
functions

873
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,720
okay we get a result

874
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,960
finally

875
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,359
we can see the

876
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,359
result in sd card files

877
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,680
that's all result of

878
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,640
privacy function call

879
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,560
and

880
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,078
some call stacks here

881
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
we found that the demo collects bss id

882
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
and android id

883
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,480
before the privacy policy are agreed

884
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,599
okay that's a demo

885
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,640
let's go to next page

886
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,319
we have categorized the api functions

887
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,079
this list shows a part of them

888
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,720
they are all detected by all tools

889
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,240
including

890
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,599
task list

891
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,680
wi-fi info app list

892
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,119
android id and system property

893
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,359
and

894
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,440
and and and so on

895
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
and the api

896
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
get running apb

897
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,640
process

898
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,560
get running tasks

899
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,800
and and so on and

900
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,319
that

901
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,839
let's go to the next page

902
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,440
then we use the automatic tools to test

903
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:06,240
149.90 popular applications from

904
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,560
different app stores

905
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,839
like google play

906
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,599
the two pictures shows the statistical

907
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,079
results about our test

908
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,800
we deduct total cons about

909
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
1041

910
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,680
applications

911
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,800
called some privacy related functions

912
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,119
even exact task and

913
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,000
system property

914
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,640
are also

915
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,160
579 applications

916
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,359
used on normal ways to get the perfect

917
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
information

918
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
the right picture shows how many

919
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,800
applications called

920
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,079
each type of privacy information in

921
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,240
which we can see

922
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,920
that there are 129

923
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,119
applications called 10 types of privacy

924
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,680
information

925
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,200
okay let's go to next page

926
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,280
this page is other statistical result

927
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,680
the next one shows

928
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,400
how many applications have taken

929
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,480
different types of privacy information

930
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,560
the right one shows

931
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,480
how many times of

932
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,680
two types of permission related of

933
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,839
privacy information

934
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,599
function code

935
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,079
we found that the number of function

936
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,880
calls for privacy information about

937
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,839
normal permission was quite high

938
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,560
it has 4005

939
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,440
about

940
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,400
70 percent

941
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,079
okay that's all let's

942
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,520
let uh background continue

943
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,400
thanks a lot sir

944
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,319
so

945
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,000
um we're gonna come to the uh last part

946
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
of today um it's a summary and

947
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,240
recommendations

948
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,280
so in summary uh what we do today is we

949
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,280
give you a very quick review on the

950
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,800
uh

951
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
data protection regulations

952
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,680
using europe union gdpr as an example

953
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,040
and then we introduce you or the design

954
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,560
of our

955
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,079
application privacy compliance framework

956
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,280
and give you some demonstration

957
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,240
so

958
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
basically the advantage of our framework

959
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,920
is it gives not only the

960
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,119
high level big picture about the data

961
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,040
privacy compliance

962
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,920
but also some enforceable

963
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,119
checklist for the security analysts and

964
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,359
also artists to

965
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,319
use

966
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,960
in the practice

967
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
and here we do have some

968
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,960
recovery recommendations

969
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,640
so the first recommendation i'm gonna

970
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,920
give to

971
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,960
the mobile users so basically they

972
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
should

973
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,359
keep their

974
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,800
devices

975
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,760
and operating systems updated

976
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
and if they're going to use if they are

977
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
using android they should you know try

978
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
upload to android android 11 because it

979
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,079
is

980
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,400
since 110 the privacy policy of google

981
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,520
starts

982
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,119
you know gets more much more stricter

983
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,520
and also for ios users they should try

984
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,359
to upload to the latest ios version

985
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,599
so for both of this

986
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,079
android ios they do have very straight

987
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,240
regulations in the

988
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
latest version so here i give the

989
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,960
example so in ios sporting if

990
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
one application uh

991
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,040
access the clipboard

992
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,640
um the user will be notified and also

993
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,839
for android 10 11 they have very

994
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,960
strict policies on the

995
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,079
um those you know previously accessible

996
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,920
in the earlier version

997
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,680
um those items now becomes inaccessible

998
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,520
in the latest android 1011

999
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,200
and

1000
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,960
for the

1001
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,000
device

1002
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,599
manufacturer we also have

1003
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,000
recommendations so they should try to

1004
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,560
upload their os to make sure it in

1005
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,440
you know

1006
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,680
compliance with those

1007
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,920
regulations those principles

1008
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,480
of the authority

1009
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,359
and

1010
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,079
that is all for our talk today and uh

1011
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,960
why can i leave you a few minutes for

1012
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,480
question

1013
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,839
thank you so much for your listening
