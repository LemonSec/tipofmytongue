hey guys so we're back q a time with

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,759
paul vixxi uh if you guys don't know who

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
paul vixx is like i think you can google

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,280
that because he's like one of like the

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,440
most famous people for dns

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,880
in fact i think he's inducted into the

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,080
internet hall of fame probably like

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,359
seven years ago or something like that

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,240
so

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,199

doing a demo

41
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
you want to read your demo first or

42
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,520

i i join just because i share the vision

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,119
of making internet a safer place for

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,479
everyone

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
and i think this is something that keeps

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,479
us all

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
uh excited and awake

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,920
and

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
and here we are

65
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,640
so just reading your bio uh and it says

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
here you you publish stuff under the

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,560
nato high tech project man that sounds

68
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
hardcore man

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
oh yes everything else you can read on

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
internet google can

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
show you things that

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,840
i may not even know about myself

73
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
anyway paul you ready for your demo

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
thing or what should we just chat or

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
what you want to do but i mean this is a

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
informal session anyway so you know it's

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
just kind of relaxed

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,280
i would like boris to uh give us a few

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
minutes of uh

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
shell scriptory

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
worries no no pressure

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,920
yes

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
uh host disable participant screen

84
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,959
sharing can you let me know once again

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
how to share my screen sure

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,200
just give us a second the studio guys

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,879
behind there are like frantically

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
clicking

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
let me see

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
yes i can

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,480
perfect

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
perfect

93
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
let us recap a little bit uh what we

94
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,879
learned from what paul mentioned about

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,959
protective dns there are many

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
definitions and

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,599
what we need to

98
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
know for this specific uh engagement

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,239
that protective dns

100
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
it's an umbrella term

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,519
for the security solutions

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,680
that will inspect your

103
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
uh

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,159
which will inspect your

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
dns query

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
and give you the answer to prevent you

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
from accessing malicious resources on

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,040
the internet

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,799
this is all we need to know and there

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,200
are many different ways to do it

111
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
who was talking about um cloud

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
providers which can offer you

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
this these are cloud providers you can

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,599
go you just uh

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,400
make a query and you will find

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
a lot of bunch of those

117
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,199
so

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
maliciousness

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
as you probably know there is a lot of

120
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
studies has been done which discovered

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
that newly

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
observed or created items on the

123
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,320
internet or assets on the internet

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
statistically

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
are not safe to deal with

126
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
from 60 to 80 percent depending on study

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
depending on exactly what was started

128
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
the data set the time from 60 to 80

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
percent so it is better than flip of a

130
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,300
coin

131
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,720
[Music]

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,759
so

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,440
new stuff on the internet not

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,400
necessarily safe to deal with from time

135
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
it appears or you learn about this

136
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,960
to the time you understand the behavior

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
it requires some efforts

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
but if you statistically know

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
that majority of those are not safe to

140
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
deal with

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,280
and there is no legitimate reason for

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
those to be accessed immediately once

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
they appeared on the internet

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
the idea is as paul mentioned in his

145
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
keynote

146
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,759
just to prevent access to those until

147
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,880
you know

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,199
how good they are

149
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
what you see on the left side flying or

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,960
pausing this uh our life observations

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,190
of newly

152
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,440
[Music]

153
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
observed items so

154
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,320
we have not seen anything of this

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,440
from the start of our observation

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,160
and we started observe it

157
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
back in 2010.

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,479
once it flies over

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,840
it will be put in our database we call

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
it dnsdb

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
and just to demonstrate that this is the

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
case i will make a query

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,520
and you will see that it was observed

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,039
very recently

165
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
one time

166
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,080
now

167
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,319
let's take another one for some reason

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
it's just uh internet is probably

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
sleeping because it's early morning here

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
in uk and then it started once again so

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
i took another random

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
and once again

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,440
this is definitely newly absorbed by us

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
so we have not seen it before we have

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,160
over 500 sensors across the globe but

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,840
this is something that

177
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,199
we never saw before let's try another

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,000
one

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
just to make sure that i can

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
reliably convince you

181
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
see the date

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,160
see the date this is 7 00 am here

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
i'm british time this is ugc so one hour

184
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
back so three minutes ago

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,039
this is what we saw

186
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,160
look

187
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
this

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
asset already has an ip

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
we observe that being query

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
so let's see now

191
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,199
something

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,880
interesting

193
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
let's take

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,919
any random dns

195
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,160
and make a lookup

196
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
let's say we do want to resolve this

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,759
stuff

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
tell me which dns to take let's say

199
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
dime i know that dyn actually

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,800
does some form of security protection

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
and this is what i do so i ask time to

202
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,720
resolve this

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,280
and it is being resolved

204
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
perhaps it already knows something is

205
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
not right because it gives 127. let's

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,440
see other domains domain name servers

207
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,319
would be able to resolve it let's do

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
google

209
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
google already know well that's good

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
that means it's so bad that this cloud

211
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
providers actually know about this let's

212
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,000
take

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
some other stuff maybe this one

214
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
and try to resolve first i demonstrate

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
to you that this is newly absorbed by us

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
we see the asset already has an id

217
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
and let's do very same thing

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
with google first

219
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
right so google doesn't know whether

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,279
it's good or bad

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,240
okay

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
let's try

223
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
some other

224
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
open dna sneak let's try code 9

225
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,010
9.9.9.9

226
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,200
[Music]

227
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,640
it also knows about this

228
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
but statistically

229
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
this is greater chance for this

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
asset to be

231
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
not safe

232
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
rather than benign

233
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
a lot of studies are there and we can

234
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
give you the links to those studies they

235
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
are done independently on different data

236
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
sets during different period of time etc

237
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,440
so what it means is if my household

238
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,279
because i'm at home now everyone works

239
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
from home or many of those

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
us i work from home

241
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
if i used

242
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,200
this dnss from here

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
right

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
i would be able

245
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
i would be able

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,839
let's get another one

247
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,860
norton i would be able

248
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,040
[Music]

249
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,599
to reach

250
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,600
[Music]

251
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
this resource from the internet

252
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,360
me my systems my family

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
and we even don't know whether this is

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
also good or bad so now let's see what

255
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
we can do as you remember

256
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
paul mentioned about some of our

257
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
projects uh here

258
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,560
uh

259
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,279
which would consume rpg response policy

260
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,640
zone

261
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,439
one of this

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
we put on the

263
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
raspberry pi

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
at home in my closet

265
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
and i consume here 24 hours rpg zone

266
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
from far side

267
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,680
so whatever you see here

268
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
would be here i already demonstrate i

269
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,279
will demonstrate the stream so whatever

270
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
you see whatever we observed

271
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
will be pushed

272
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
through the internet right to my

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,959
raspberry pi

274
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,760
so

275
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,600
one solution

276
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,800
is

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,040
bind dns with rpg on it and under

278
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,959
quite nice uh gui management from ioc to

279
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
our pc project

280
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,399
the same

281
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,640
is under pichol so i have raspberry pi

282
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,560
with bind on it and my pi hole

283
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
works with bind which consumes the rpg

284
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
feed so at home i have six client this

285
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
is my statistics as you can see here

286
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,560
right now let's see how this stuff would

287
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
work

288
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,920
i

289
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
am trusting farsight to tell me what to

290
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
do with all those assets that's why i

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
put given everything else it's just

292
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,800
different configuration you don't need

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,279
to go into those uh deep stuff what you

294
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
need to know is very simple thing

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
if i now try

296
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,440
to resolve this asset

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
for one of my dns servers at home

298
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,639
192 168 that query directly

299
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,519
ate

300
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
100

301
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,000
this one

302
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
i will not be given any ip to

303
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,959
reach

304
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,320
if that asset indeed was not safe to

305
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,519
work with my household would be

306
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,800
protected

307
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
you may say well you were talking a lot

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
and that's why it's so cool and then you

309
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
now show us this stuff

310
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
let's take this one

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,920
okay

312
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,319
and

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
let's make it

314
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
real

315
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,519
so this one is still on the screen right

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
but my dns at home

317
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
will not let me go there

318
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
let's try uh

319
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,839
the one so yes let's try the one

320
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
192 168.

321
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
okay my typing in the morning is not

322
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,000
night time is okay 192 168 8 100

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
right

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,480
so that's clean

325
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
so something which is going still

326
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
from here let's take this one

327
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,399
let's go in here

328
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,680
and very very same domain

329
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,239
which was flying right on my screen

330
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
not quick enough

331
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,240
let's try another dns

332
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
one one one one which is mine

333
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
that's true there would be thermal fail

334
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,360
if we kept this up

335
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
yes all right you'll take another domain

336
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
that's not a big deal

337
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
no i think one demo fails enough let's

338
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
put well we're behind

339
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,479
want to fail is enough

340
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
too failed enough

341
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
yes okay

342
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
that's what you get from working from

343
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
home man

344
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
comcast has

345
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
really messed with me during demos um so

346
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,480
anyway i'm not going to worry about that

347
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
it does work

348
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,279
and um

349
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
we i just um

350
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,519
uh just published the video

351
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,120
with the where there were no demo

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
failures so that those demos were

353
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,040
successfully rigged anyway do we have

354
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,360
any questions i don't have the discord

355
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,560
client operating i could if i needed to

356
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,279
but

357
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
uh trusting at the moment uh there are

358
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
no questions from the audience however i

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,519
think sriman had a question that he

360
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
wanted to ask you guys a while ago yeah

361
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
so like you should in a demo right

362
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,360
people are more people are looking from

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
home more and more nowadays since kowitt

364
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,760
and all of their stuff and an rpg option

365
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,720
for

366
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
employees working from home is a bit

367
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
hard to implement how do you see dns or

368
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,920
dns monitoring sync holding

369
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
evolving in in in this situation

370
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
well i think right now

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
um

372
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,839
we're moving from one model that we knew

373
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,680
about to another model that we either

374
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
don't know about or don't like

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
um because it used to be that to work

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
from home you had a vpn

377
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,240
and vpn software used to go you know

378
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
reach its claws into your os and

379
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,920
it so that if you were connected to the

380
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,000
vpn then you could not reach anything

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
but that vpn and that would somehow keep

382
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,160
i don't know the kids gaming pc from

383
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
infecting you while you were attached to

384
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,880
the corporate mothership and so forth

385
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,000
um tricks like that don't really work

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
but they all sound good so they show up

387
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,959
as checklist items for endpoint and vpn

388
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
and so people buy the one that has that

389
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,199
then they depend on it then hell breaks

390
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,199
loose but

391
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,959
um that we didn't like

392
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,959
uh what we're going toward now is uh the

393
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
kind of uh god what do they call it

394
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,160
um the the trust

395
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,279
free you know where you you you never

396
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,839
have special access

397
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,680
to some of these servers like this is

398
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
the beyond corp or the zero corp or

399
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
something like that um where you never

400
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
have access based on where you're coming

401
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,880
from or what you can reach with a packet

402
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,279
that everything you do is certificate

403
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
based it's it's based on you know what

404
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
tickets you're holding and

405
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
as a result you know you could

406
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,959
conceivably run that corporate

407
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
network without a firewall other than

408
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
for ddos protection

409
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
and you wouldn't worry because none of

410
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,199
your file servers or printers or

411
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
anything would be willing to do anything

412
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
for anybody who didn't have

413
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,120
the right you know key material the

414
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
right certificate material

415
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,400
and

416
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,439
the people who are pushing that are you

417
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,400
know

418
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
i gotta say i i love the vision i don't

419
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
know where to get the crack that they're

420
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,240
smoking but um

421
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
it's um

422
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,000
you know what we're going to end up with

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,439
is a bunch of people who actually

424
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,400
believe they have that and um

425
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,799
that they're not going to even try

426
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
to worry about um the multiple horizon

427
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
problem where you're connected to the

428
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,799
corporate network and to various other

429
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
networks that are full of untrustworthy

430
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
people who might

431
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
somehow be able to masquerade as you i

432
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
don't know maybe it's

433
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,170
uh

434
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,559
[Music]

435
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
arp poisoning or something like that so

436
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
um

437
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
i am

438
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,799
i am concerned

439
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,039
but uh i think that for work from home

440
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,880
uh we're gonna have to have hardened

441
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
configs uh there there are ways to make

442
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
sure that your whatever your windows pc

443
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,039
cannot have its configuration changed by

444
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,080
somebody who doesn't have the

445
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
administrator password um and i think

446
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
within that i know apple has something

447
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,320
like that i'm sure smartphones are going

448
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
to have things like that within that

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,400
umbrella

450
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
i anticipate that the dns server will be

451
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,440
wired down to one that conforms to the

452
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,240
corporate security policy

453
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,559
that is unfortunately economically

454
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
infeasible for a family they are never

455
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,480
going to pay for that version of windows

456
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,880
or that version of mac os or any of that

457
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
but at least for the work from home

458
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,880
crowd for the bigger companies

459
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,720
or the smaller companies who can afford

460
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
to buy managed service provider you know

461
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,760
real i.t support in other words i think

462
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
we're going to see it i think

463
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,799
it'll just be that

464
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
when you are

465
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,320
using your work laptop you are using

466
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
some

467
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
name server that was uh approved by

468
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
works sysadmin

469
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
and works sysadmin may decide that the

470
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
way they can make their phone ring the

471
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,160
least

472
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
is if you have

473
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
personal dns on your laptop running rpz

474
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,440
so that you don't call them because

475
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,039
there was a network hiccup you can

476
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,600
actually do a lookup using your normal

477
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,559
isp but enforcing policy inside your

478
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
corporate laptop i think that model has

479
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
got legs

480
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,960
sorry long answer to a short question

481
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,080
how long do you think that's going to

482
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
take before we see that happening is in

483
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
like 6 months 12 months more than that

484
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
and would that be another agent running

485
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
on the machine

486
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,840
or

487
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,160
um

488
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
well moore's law has been kind so

489
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,600
fortunately the cores and the gigabytes

490
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
that are needed

491
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
to do all this extra stuff are all there

492
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
the unfortunate part is that they're all

493
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
full of buggy software and polluted

494
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
supply chains but

495
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
you know you asked a question you know

496
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
how soon before we see this

497
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,000
i

498
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,919
want to ask a different question would

499
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,720
we have seen it

500
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,880
so i think

501
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
an interesting question is how long

502
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,159
before this is not news

503
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
how long before

504
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,799
administrators everywhere are behaving

505
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,559
this way and know that this is in the

506
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,200
bag of tricks i don't know uh probably a

507
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
couple of um

508
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
usenix meetings

509
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
or whatever it takes to get the word out

510
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,360
uh and maybe for the folks at home that

511
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,679
just want to stay secure or increase

512
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
their privacy right is it is it

513
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
is it something easy for them to

514
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,760
implement a bind server with rpg

515
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
filtering on it or

516
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
did you have a recommendation on that

517
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,960
so

518
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
um i do

519
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
um

520
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,799
and you know what i'll say is that for

521
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,799
somebody who goes to your conference

522
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,679
ever

523
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,960
this is easy

524
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,039
um and

525
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,679
you and i both wish more people would go

526
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,720
um

527
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,760
and

528
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,559
so

529
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,200
my problem is that the

530
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,799
your average

531
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
person where the assisted men for their

532
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
company's chief claim to fame is that

533
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
they have certain certifications and

534
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,360
they've got you know

535
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
a degree and they've got whatever cisco

536
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,520
network security

537
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,440
certification or microsoft review

538
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
whatever those people

539
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
are really going to be using a bunch of

540
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
off-the-shelf stuff

541
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,200
and uh they probably will never think

542
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
that they have to come to a conference

543
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
like yours which i think is too bad and

544
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,919
will slow their career development

545
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,760
as well as holding the world back from

546
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,039
getting safer sooner but um

547
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,760
you know until microsoft and apple and

548
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
the rest of those folks decide that they

549
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
want to start training people to this

550
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,360
model and documenting it not sure how

551
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,559
much it matters what we do

552
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
that's encouraging

553
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,360
[Laughter]

554
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,039
but it's yeah i mean that's the reality

555
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,320
we live in right unless there's some

556
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
kind of commercial viability and need

557
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
for them to actually push this agenda

558
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
they're not going to do it i mean who's

559
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,200
going to pay for that right

560
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
but um

561
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,679
what's your plans for i mean at first

562
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,960
sight right like what are you guys up to

563
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
for the rest of the year any like

564
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,440
anything interesting planned or stay

565
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
safe stay home

566
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,120
well i'll be at uh thick and little

567
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
as will boris because it's a short

568
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
flight for a train ride for him across

569
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
the channel

570
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,039
um

571
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,760
so i will be in france next month

572
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,039
um be back in london for

573
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
black hat europe which i guess is in

574
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
november yep um

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
unless it's cancelled you know i was

576
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
scheduled to speak at the wild west hack

577
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
and fest and that went all full virtual

578
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,919
yesterday ah so

579
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,080
um

580
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,080
yeah so the the company did go to

581
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,120
oh god black hat las vegas

582
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,000
but

583
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,600
there it was kind of an interesting

584
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
turnabout where they didn't cancel it

585
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
they didn't make it virtual but we

586
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,000
decided we weren't going because we

587
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,840
looked at the numbers from

588
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,679
you know the various government websites

589
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
and said you know we cannot in good

590
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
conscience ask employees to go there and

591
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,919
we don't think anyone else is going to

592
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,240
either and so yeah it was ghost town but

593
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,600
we did uh we did do a virtual thing and

594
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,360
we did talk to some folks we made some

595
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
announcements we made an announcement

596
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,799
about protective dns

597
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,640
to say you know thank you dod um

598
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,679
and you know this is what protective dns

599
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
also means kind of the same as the talk

600
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,880
i just gave

601
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
but we also indicated that um

602
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
you know we're about to roll out you

603
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,480
know a handful of new

604
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
subscription feeds using this particular

605
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
system so that

606
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
certainly the appliance vendors were

607
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
likely to put our new feeds in their

608
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,799
catalogs

609
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,960
and um

610
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
the the customers that come to us for

611
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,440
newly observed we can now say hey look

612
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,799
look what else we have that you didn't

613
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,840
know about

614
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,520
nice nice nice

615
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,360
well fingers crossed that you know

616
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,799
nothing else gets canceled for the rest

617
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,480
of this year it seems that most things

618
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
are starting to open back up at least

619
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,400
like it appears that way europe uh i

620
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,640
mean our dutch guys are netherlands they

621
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,919
don't mean like nobody's very much you

622
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,440
can just walk around i'm like whoa

623
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,360
that's amazing man

624
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,679
it seems so like a you know

625
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,679
so i want to say

626
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
this delta thing is catching a lot of

627
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,919
people by surprise and so a lot of

628
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,320
my news has turned out to be old

629
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,039
um i had a um

630
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
a business trip to

631
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
germany and denmark

632
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,360
uh last month and it was great and uh i

633
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
keep a motorcycle in each of those

634
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
countries and that also was great but um

635
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
in fact i keep a motorcycle in in london

636
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
not far from boris as well

637
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,279
um

638
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,279
but um

639
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,600
the the time since then it looks like

640
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,279
germany has gone back to quarantining uh

641
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,120
people who who come in from outside

642
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,279
country yeah because their numbers were

643
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,799
just too high this delta thing is taking

644
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,919
uh

645
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,760
making a big reset in what we all

646
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
thought our plans were going to be yeah

647
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,960
i know man tell me about it i mean we

648
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
have plans for trying to do something in

649
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
november in uae for cyber week right

650
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
uh right this point in time like today

651
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,320
right everything seems fine but you know

652
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,159
tomorrow's another day and this thing is

653
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
just so unpredicted right i mean nobody

654
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
could have written this

655
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
this truth is stranger than fiction but

656
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
yeah i mean i remain hopeful fingers

657
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,279
crossed you know we'll be able to chill

658
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,320
out again soon rather than later

659
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
me too but i'd rather do it later and

660
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,039
have both of us uh be there for it so

661
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,080
i think

662
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
caution is indicated indeed indeed

663
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,080
anyway gentlemen thank you so much for

664
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,679
joining us uh

665
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
always insightful nice to see paul again

666
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,039
i mean it would be better if we were in

667
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,279
person but hey you know what can we do

668
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,520
right

669
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
thanks to

670
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
yes and at the end the screen was

671
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,720
showing uh everything in life and those

672
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
who were watching they were able to see

673
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,480
it

674
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
and this is going to be recorded anyway

675
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,919
man so it's right they'll watch it after

676
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,279
the fact like

677
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,200
we'll release all of the thoughts onto

678
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,720
our youtube as well so

679
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,159
yeah they'll be able to watch it there

680
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,679
and like yeah it'll be fine it'll be

681
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,679
fine
