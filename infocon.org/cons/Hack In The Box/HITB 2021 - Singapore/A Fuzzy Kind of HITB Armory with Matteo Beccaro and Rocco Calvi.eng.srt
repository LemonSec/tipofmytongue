00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
chief technology officer basically but

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,519
he is also most famously i suppose known

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,640
as the guy who started the hiv armory

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,199
and then rocco who has been around for

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
quite some time in the security industry

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,558
it's also been at various hangar box

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:33,920
events he's spoken in our conference in

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,080
your crab

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,880
remember when you guys came down you

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,159
were like yeah

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
the chitty crab incident right like

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
everybody so for the guys watching at

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,680
home right like when the hill came down

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,080
and we went out for crabs everybody was

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
done and he's like where's everybody

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
going there's still crabs here

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
uh what are you gonna smile at me for

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
cleaning the plates uh

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
at the end of the evening

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
you did a true asian thing you know like

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
eat the crabs down to the last bits

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
right like it doesn't matter your

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,439
fingers are the tea but that's how you

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,720
eat crabs when you can't eat it with a

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,479
[ __ ] spoon

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
exactly that's the stage that's the

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,680
point where you guys now man like uh in

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
i mean obviously at home but i mean

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
which part of the world

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,479
so i'm in the middle east

56
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800
actually i'm currently in dubai

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
for a few weeks before i fly back to

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
italy in september

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
it's so weird right i mean you know

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
you're not far from each other but yet

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
you're still separated you know it's

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
like kind of weird right now we're still

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
sitting here everybody's on zoom like

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
what the hell man like abu dhabi and

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,519
dubai is what like 100 kilometers away

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
something like that

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
yeah like one hour probably so far

73
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,519
getting a cab basically you should have

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
met up we didn't talk

75
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,360
we can meet the meet police in the

76
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
some

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
cafe in the highway yeah in the middle

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,599
in the middle right in the no man's land

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,040
it's not like the helicopter service as

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
well there they used to be used to i

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,760
don't know if they're still running that

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,040
man i think now with kobe they can't

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
tell that like yeah no helicopter but

84
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,640
you have to go through the pcr testing

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,599
roadblock which is on the road

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
anyway guys hey so tell us like uh

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
i mean obviously we know about what's

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
going on in november at the armory but

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,000
uh maybe you guys want to mate you want

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,680
to walk us through a little bit about

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
what you have in store what you're

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,440
planning what you're thinking

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
yeah sure so before i

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
share some of the actual details

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
i just want to do a quick introduction

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
about what's the armory in case uh some

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,280
of the

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
people here didn't uh

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
attend to some previous session that we

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
organized uh back in singapore amsterdam

101
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,200
and uh also in a bunch of other

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,840
conferences in the past so armory is

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
basically um small event inside the main

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
conference where we give the opportunity

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
and the possibility to developers of

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,879
security tools of different

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,439
types it can be offensive tools can be

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,239
defensive can be related to

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
training activities we really are open

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:05,760
to

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,519
any category of of software

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
to give the opportunity to the

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
developers of such tools to present the

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
tool itself

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,160
to showcase the functionality to explain

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,759
to the audience a bit about the

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,320
issues they encounter during development

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
about the

119
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,479
next and future features they are

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,360
planning to include in the tool getting

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
some feedback it's a very

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
um informal and intimate way to discuss

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,199
about the tool it's more much more

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
intimate than a standard talk we are not

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
going to give them a stage and let them

126
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,080
present in front of an audience but it

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,880
will be face to face the developers will

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
have a small boot

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
in which they will have a screen they

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,639
can present the tool they can show off

131
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
some demos and they can interact with

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
the audience again that's the main

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
purpose giving the chance to interact

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,400
with the people joining for the

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
conference and that they want to maybe

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,039
take a break from the standard talk

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
maybe they want to

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
understand a bit better about the inner

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
workings of any of the tools they may

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,840
use on their daily life

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,600
in the in the security

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
in the security world so that's more or

143
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,880
less the

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
general idea

145
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,919
about the armory uh this year we are

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,320
going to announce um

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,039
a

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,479
special tool category uh thanks to

149
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
piis and thanks to rocco for the

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,759
sponsorship of the

151
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,520
armory event

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
so rocco you want to introduce a bit

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
about what you do so that maybe our

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,600
audience can understand about the

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,880
special category of easier

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
yep definitely so

157
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
i'm leading the digital security

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
research center

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,240
at tii

160
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,919
and what we're trying to do we're trying

161
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,199
to automate

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
the vulnerability discovery we're trying

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
to prove vulnerabilities and also harden

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
the software under test but one of our

165
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
main focuses right now is to improve the

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
current state of the fuzzers that we use

167
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
to find bugs in the industry

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
we've seen a lot of good papers come out

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
recently in academia

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
and a lot of good tools that are coming

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,759
out of um

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
the industry as well but we feel that

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
there's still a lot of gap there that

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,199
needs to be

175
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
improved on to really be able to find

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
all the bugs

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
during a fuzzing test so we're looking

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
for people that can build

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
better tools

180
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
with us so we're we're partnering with

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,440
multiple people around the world

182
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
including us

183
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
europe also asia

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,960
and we're trying to work on a common

185
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
goal to fix the actual

186
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,280
problems that you run into during a

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
fuzzing campaign such as like

188
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
scalability getting proper correct

189
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
coverage

190
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
finding all the proper bugs which you

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,639
might miss during a fuzzing campaign so

192
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,560
we're super excited to be able to

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
sponsor at the hack in the box cyber

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
week that's going to happen in november

195
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,120
we want to see armory to have some

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
really good fuzzing tools and we want to

197
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,919
maybe build a competition around that as

198
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,800
well and provide some prize money so

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,240
we're gonna probably create a a data set

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
around that on some of the the software

201
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
that we want the tools to test and see

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
if they can find those actual bugs and

203
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,639
see how fast they can do it so this is

204
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,120
what we're thinking uh to make it more

205
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
like a fun uh competitive activity with

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
the armored edge

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
at hacking the box

208
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,639
awesome and it's so material and rocco

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
right so the idea with this with this

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,680
fuzzing tool set demonstration thingy uh

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,039
i'm guessing not everybody's gonna be

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,800
able to come so is there gonna be a way

213
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,639
that they can kind of like

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
show off their tool remotely or

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,039
are we only going to have like the guys

216
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
you have to fly into uae what's the plan

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
yeah so i think due to the pandemic

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
making it very hard for everyone to

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
attend the conference we definitely want

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to open it up for anyone around the

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
world to um

222
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,639
to attend the the conference especially

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
the armature and to also show off their

224
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
tools that they've been working on

225
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
through the uh

226
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,599
so no limitation right like i need to

227
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,199
author even if they can't physically

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,960
make the trip over they can still apply

229
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
to show off their tool at the armory and

230
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
if they have a fuzzing related tool they

231
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
i don't know qualify for this

232
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
subcategory or prices or

233
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,958
yeah exactly yeah there should be no

234
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,399
limitation that you need to be there in

235
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,320
business awesome and awesome awesome i

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,080
like you like it and so in terms of the

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,599
testing as in can you give us some

238
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
insight into what you're looking for is

239
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,480
in like what kind of like i mean you

240
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
mentioned like you know the scalability

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
and you know the coverage and that kind

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
of stuff but how are we actually going

243
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,560
to

244
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
evaluate right because different tools

245
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
are

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
kind of ghetto different things right

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,519
that's true so we're still trying to

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
define the actual rules and how we're

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
going to measure

250
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
for the actual results that we want but

251
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
some of the things could be like

252
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
can you properly scale your solution and

253
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
how fast you can find those bugs so we

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,640
might look at ways that the current

255
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
google fuzz bench is doing it and use

256
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
some of those matrix

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
to bring into the ways that we measure

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
how good the fuzzer is

259
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
so yeah we still need to really work out

260
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
the details but it's mainly going to be

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
like the code coverage can we reproduce

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
the the bugs that you discovered

263
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
are they actually critical bugs that you

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
found or they're actually false

265
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,279
positives so stuff like this we're

266
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
thinking about we still need to really

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
define

268
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
exactly what the rules are going to be

269
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,000
and what we're actually looking for

270
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
when do you think we can expect this to

271
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
be published i mean obvious obviously

272
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,320
cyborg is in november uh we're almost at

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
we're almost to september now right

274
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,560
and then it's true

275
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
exactly so we're definitely going to be

276
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,519
moving quick

277
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
uh we're using similar matrix already

278
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
with the tools that we're developing

279
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
in our center so i think

280
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
we'll probably use some of those matrix

281
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
to see to

282
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
to allow the competitors to also

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
leverage those so i would say in a

284
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,839
couple of weeks we should have these

285
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
finalized exactly what we're looking for

286
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,560
for the competition awesome so i guess

287
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
we'll publish that on the website as

288
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
soon as you guys provide that to us

289
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
um yeah yeah but i mean in addition to

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,399
that mateo as in from uh for the armory

291
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,839
side of things right are you guys hoping

292
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,839
to get any other kind of tools in

293
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,200
particular or are we just going to be

294
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,120
focusing on puzzles for this particular

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
edition no no fuzzing for us is just the

296
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
let's say the special category of the

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
year

298
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
but we will keep open the armory event

299
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
for any other category that we have

300
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
accepted also in the past i know so we

301
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,440
are not limiting only to fuzzing but we

302
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,160
can also accept like for example a few

303
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,399
years ago if you remember in singapore

304
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
we brought over automotive security

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
tools we brought over other security

306
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
tools we brought over uh defensive even

307
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,959
from a defensive point of view we had a

308
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,920
bunch of uh of tools and and developers

309
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
joining our our event so the

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
fuzzing category for sure is the special

311
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
one for this year with some extra

312
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
competition and possibly prices but at

313
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
the same time we keep everything open as

314
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
usual for any other category of tools

315
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,880
and

316
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
any other developers that want to

317
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,079
showcase what is working on in the past

318
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,320
do you guys have

319
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
yeah no go ahead no i'm just saying that

320
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,200
we are planning to start the call for

321
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
full as well for the armory

322
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
so let me just uh

323
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
share very quickly

324
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,279
the screen

325
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,079
yeah it's going to ask you like you know

326
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,120
pretty much

327
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
how many tools uh are you guys expecting

328
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
or how many tools are we gonna accept

329
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
right uh in total

330
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
so in terms of numbers at the moment we

331
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
are we are going to have around six to

332
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
eight booths available we usually do

333
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
uh two rounds uh per day so around two

334
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,079
hours for each

335
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
developer to present the tool for each

336
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
of the two days of the conference

337
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
so that gives us around 12 to 16

338
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,440
possible tools

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
um

340
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
and we can we can grow a bit more on

341
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,920
that if we see a lot of high quality

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
submissions so we have

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,959
quite enough

344
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,920
space in this year

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
so six to eight uh that's for on-site

346
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,240
right and then for for the remote tools

347
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,399
in the guys that are not going to be

348
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
able to come is there a limit or are we

349
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
just going to do as many as we possibly

350
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
can or what's planned for the remote we

351
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,519
don't have the logistical uh limitation

352
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,040
that we have for the

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,320
on-site

354
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
event so for that part we don't have our

355
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
fixed numbers of

356
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
tools that we can accept we want to keep

357
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
it

358
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,079
reasonable because we want to get the

359
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
chance for everyone that is attending

360
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,160
either remotely or

361
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
on site to be able to view and to

362
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,399
discuss

363
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,120
with all the possible uh

364
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,040
developers that we are going to have in

365
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
the conference so we are going to try to

366
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,560
keep it uh

367
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
um

368
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,839
possible for anyone to visit everything

369
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
to view everything

370
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
but we don't have a strict limitation

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,399
for the

372
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,079
for the remote

373
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,839
tools that are going to be

374
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,360
on the stage

375
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
when are we opening this bro because i

376
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,400
just noticed there's no dates

377
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,600
[Laughter]

378
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
the date is on the second flight now

379
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
there it is i was like hey man where's

380
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
the ditch where i'm asking the guys like

381
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,000
hey how could the slides have no idea

382
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
the standard the standard call for paper

383
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,199
or golfer tool will be open today

384
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
and probably by end of the day also and

385
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
we are planning to split it into two

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,240
rounds just to get a better idea about

387
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,360
how to organize all the logistic part so

388
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
the first round will run for about two

389
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,880
weeks from today until the 10th of

390
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,519
september and the second round will

391
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,839
start the come the next day and we'll

392
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,160
run for another couple of weeks okay and

393
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,639
then we have uh about two weeks before

394
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,160
we announce all the accepted uh speaker

395
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,920
slash developers for the for the event

396
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
and

397
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
hopefully in the meantime you're also

398
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
going to have all the details about the

399
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
fuzzing competition but

400
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,920
in either case all the puzzles

401
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
developers out there are more than happy

402
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,040
to start submitting even if they don't

403
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
want to participate specifically in the

404
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,000
challenge they can still showcase the

405
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,440
tool so start preparing your submission

406
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
don't worry and

407
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
we will publish more and more details on

408
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
the website as soon as possible

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
in terms of submissions bro how we how

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,279
are you planning to get the submissions

411
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,079

412
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
how do they apply no we are going to we

413
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,639
are going to publish everything on the

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,440
cyber week website so

415
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,240
together with the main call for paper

416
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
you will also get the chance to submit

417
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
for the armory event specifically for

418
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
the armory event

419
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,120
we are going to ask a few details about

420
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
the tool so what is the purpose what are

421
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
the main features

422
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,560
and

423
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,519
if you already have publish a github or

424
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
gitlab repository in which we can find

425
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,600
the source code and

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,519
some other information that we can start

427
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,600
publishing to advertise the tool to the

428
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
audience so that the audience know

429
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,000
uh what they are going to see during the

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
event

431
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
cool man and so in terms of like

432
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
criteria for selection are we only

433
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,160
talking like open source it must be an

434
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,639
open source tool or like semi-commercial

435
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,279
or are there any limitations

436
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,040
there is no strict limitation

437
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
however we tend to

438
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
prefer or to push more for open source

439
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
tools because it allows a

440
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
more strict interaction with the

441
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
audience so the audience can also get

442
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,240
involved in the actual development but

443
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
if you also have semi-commercial tool we

444
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
may have some

445
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
additional space that we can reserve

446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
in case uh

447
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
we notice a

448
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
very good quality submission so don't be

449
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,880
afraid don't be limited to open source

450
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,079
stuff

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
we can we can review everything we are

452
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
happy to review everything and i'm sure

453
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
we can find uh some spot for uh for

454
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:42,959
anyone

455
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,560
excellent and so in terms of like for

456
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,360
the the two authors that apply um what

457
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
are we giving them i mean like well for

458
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
flights to to subway plus hotel and like

459
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
did you get any other

460
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,920
any other yeah we we are we are uh

461
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
planning to give to any accepted tool as

462
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,759
small honorarium we are defining the

463
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
amount

464
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,600
in

465
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,720
between today and tomorrow so during the

466
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
opening of the call for tool

467
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
uh that will be given as a cash prize to

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
all the accepted tools and

469
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
on top of that for the special category

470
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,039
of the year for the funds in part we

471
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,039

sponsored by ti

473
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,959
so that's another um another small

474
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
honorarium that we are planning to give

475
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
to

476
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,280
some of the devs awesome what happens if

477
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
you're a startup like can you apply if

478
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,080
you're

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
like like let's just say you you don't

480
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,679
have funding yet but you know you you

481
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,160
have a startup absolutely if you have an

482
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
open source tool or a semi-commercial

483
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,679
tool that you

484
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,520
want to move to a startup type of thing

485

uh we can also you can also submit

486
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
and we are going to have probably a

487
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,280
dedicated area that can be within the

488
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
armory or in uh in a close by

489
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,600
section of the conference dedicated for

490
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
startup that uh that are looking to

491
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,240
raise some funding that are looking to

492
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
meet and greet with investors and we are

493
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,440
planning to publish some additional

494
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
details about uh such opportunities very

495
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,679
shortly

496
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
excellent rocco just a quick question

497
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
bro like in terms of like for the the

498
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,480
two guys that are coming over right um

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
let's just say that uh

500
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,559
that too requires some funding is that

501
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
something that tii would be

502
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
will be willing to support or is that

503
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,919
beyond the scope of what dii does

504
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,400
yeah so we're thinking depending on how

505
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
good the tool performs during the

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,280
competition

507
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,320
maybe we will partner with them

508
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
maybe we will

509
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,559
hire them or maybe we can sponsor their

510
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,960
project as well for further development

511
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,120
cool that that makes a big difference

512
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
because i think you know like right now

513
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,679
uh opportunities uh

514
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,919
are not that many right and and a lot of

515
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,600
really good tools but a lot of them

516
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
don't really get to see the light of day

517
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
uh and they normally die and we're just

518
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,200
talking to fatigue just now and he was

519
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
talking about his view ip tool right his

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
vipro tool that he built way back in

521
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
like 2015 and he's the sole developer

522
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
who's supporting the entire project and

523
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
building out all the functionality for

524
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
it and it doesn't scale right i mean

525
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,480
he's one guy

526
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
and he's got a day job that's not

527
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
funding that particular project

528
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
so you know i think if ti is offering

529
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
some kind of like um

530
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
commercial uh terms for at least for

531
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,280
some of these tools at least they can

532
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,840
they can continue to build right um

533
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,720
yeah we're already working with um

534
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,720
a partner of ours which is um

535
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,760
um

536
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,840
zafar software they were part of the

537
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,400
cyber grand challenge back in 2016. oh

538
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
cool at

539
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
they built some very good tooling around

540
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
binary rewriting

541
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
and now we're working with them trying

542
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
to advance that tool that they developed

543
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,919
back then so maybe an opportunity might

544
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,840
be highlighted during the competition

545
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
that we can do a similar thing

546
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,760
with someone else who competes at the

547
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,159
armory actually

548
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,360
it's cool that you guys are actually

549
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
taking a proactive role in trying to you

550
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
know

551
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
give these opportunities to folks and

552
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,000
actually recognize the two authors

553
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
contribution because a lot of times

554
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
people just use the tool and like yeah

555
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,120
it works damn nice man good stuff but

556
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
nobody pays for it or you know at least

557
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,799
try to support the development or you

558
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,360
know enhance those tools

559
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,440
uh so it's quite nice to see the ii

560
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
playing a role in that

561
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,280
yeah and the the people that we have

562
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
already in the center are super

563
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,720
passionate so they want to see other

564
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,000
researchers

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,080
also advance their tools so we can also

566
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
give them good

567
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,240
evaluation feedback on and suggestions

568
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
on how and what what we've learned and

569
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,320
what they can apply to also their tools

570
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
to further advance

571
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159
so we'll be also there in person the

572
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
whole team um and yeah we definitely

573
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
want to see fuzzers

574
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,799
get better and better over time so

575
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,520
that's why we're supporting this event

576
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
mateo quick question man if it's a if

577
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,679
it's a student that has a

578
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,320
like a post-grad research

579
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,159
and they are willing to come and like

580
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,919
present it but it's not full fully

581
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,000
fleshed out yet is there any support

582
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
that you guys can give them in order to

583
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
get that stuff ready for presentation

584
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,679
because i think a lot of times we get a

585
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,280
lot of younger guys

586
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
and they feel like oh i can't speak a

587
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,799
heck of a box you know i don't have

588
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
anything cool or it's not like you know

589
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
elite enough whatever the hell that

590
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,799
means uh and a lot of times they just

591
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,640
require that motivation that support of

592
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
somebody yeah absolutely and and as you

593
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
as you're well aware

594
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,159
i started partially my my security

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,720
career also thank you to thanks to the

596
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
hacking the box conference series so i'm

597
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
more than happy to

598
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
i'm not saying mentor but at least to

599
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
support and give the right push i know

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
how to give the right push to the

601
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,280
younger guys in order to start

602
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
and

603
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
and and to try at least try to submit

604
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,600
their research even they think it's not

605
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
cool enough it probably is

606
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
and if it's something related to fuzzing

607
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
i'm sure that uh

608
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,799
we can arrange some support also from

609
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,880
rocco's and his team

610
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
and they can also provide some feedback

611
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,480
on the technical part of their research

612
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,039
before they start submitting or while

613
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,720
they are writing the

614
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,799
the call for paper uh

615
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
documentation and information so

616
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
absolutely don't be afraid on the

617
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,840
website there will be my email address

618

about the research and i can provide

623
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
some feedback and i can involve some

624
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,400
other parties depending on the specific

625
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
topic that you are researching on

626
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,240
so guys i mean this is like

627
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,640
unprecedented okay like

628
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
pretty much mateo will give you one on

629
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,440
one

630
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
and i help guide your tool if you are

631
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
not ready to present so you know really

632
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
you guys should take up this opportunity

633
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
i mean no matter what level you think

634
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,120
you are whether you're like you know a

635
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
super elite or not everybody has to

636
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
start somewhere uh and we really hope

637
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
that more of the the two authors will

638
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
actually come and make use of this

639
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
opportunity number one we haven't

640
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,120
traveled so it's a good time to come and

641
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
like hang out again

642
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,960
but uh yeah i mean it's uh it's so great

643
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,280
to see tri actually uh stepping up and

644
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,960
of course mateo you know like running

645
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
armory is uh

646
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
is your passion right like then nobody's

647
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
paying for for it to happen but it's

648
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
nice to to see that you're continuously

649
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,000
pushing the

650
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
the industry forward right and trying to

651
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,240
get the the best tools noticed so that

652
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
you know more people can use them

653
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,799
absolutely small way to to give back to

654
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,520
the

655
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
community and

656
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
at the same time give the chance to

657
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,279
newcomers

658
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
to enter in the industry

659
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
awesome super important

660
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
it's the only way we're going to really

661
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
advance it if everyone has the

662
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,720
opportunity to show off their their

663
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
capability and their tools that they've

664
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,919
been working on

665
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,679
cool man um

666
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,960
we've got like about five minutes left

667
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,559
anything else you guys want to talk

668
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,080
about about like you know anything to

669
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
look forward to for the armory side of

670
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,039
