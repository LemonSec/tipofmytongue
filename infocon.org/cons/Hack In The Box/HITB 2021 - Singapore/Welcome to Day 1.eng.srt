51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
some software divine radio hacking these

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
are the labs that you need to join i

53
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
think registration is still open so a

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,320
bit late but better late than never

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,880
and of course we have our ctf which will

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
be wrapping things up first on day two

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
but before we get to that

58
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,600
let's take a look at the agenda

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
uh so yeah as i mentioned mark's gonna

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,040
be joining us in just a little bit i

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
think he's um

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,439
already with cooper if i i hope he's

63
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
really really cooper

64
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
in the in the track one so uh we'll be

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
kicking things off at 12 o'clock with a

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,720
marked out

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,440
and then as always uh fully packed

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,920
schedule fully packed uh we try not to

69
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,520
keep too much break in between because

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
while everything is live streamed and

71
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,120
knowing that most of you might not be

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
watching this live

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
uh doesn't make sense to have a break in

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
between so as you'll find that most of

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,319
the talks are pretty much all back to

76
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,200
back

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
and uh in between uh talks right so

78
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,879
here and there while we're having the

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,760
conference we'll also be having our

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
interviews right so

81
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,480
stuff that's happening in the studio uh

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,160
so mark's going to be doing his keynote

83
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,760
and immediately after he'll be joining

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
so if you guys as i mentioned you're

86
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
you scroll all the way down to the

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
bottom

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,160
