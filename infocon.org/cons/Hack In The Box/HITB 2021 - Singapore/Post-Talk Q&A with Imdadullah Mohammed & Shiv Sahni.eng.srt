uh

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
you guys have been

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,960
working on this i guess for quite a

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
while right in your day-to-day

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
guys yeah actually yes so uh we are

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,480
working a lot on mobile side

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,719
so and this is one of the components

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
like that is extensively used in like

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,800
the current era of mobile development so

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
you get a lot of cool findings out out

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,320
that

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,640
but especially if it's about web use

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,920
so um i'm checking the discord we don't

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
seem to have any questions from uh

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
participants however i had a question

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,320
for you guys about

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
the security theme at grab i mean i know

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
that shift now doesn't work for grab i

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,520
mean now you work for jp morgan j is

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
great uh but you used to guys used to go

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
for grab right so maybe you guys can

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
just tell us a little bit about like uh

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
securing such a large app right such a

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
large infrastructure

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
the complexity of the grab app has only

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
grown right as in now you got like the

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
yeah you know you can book rides you can

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
order food you can send packages right

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
and then they've got our e-wallet as

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,159
well

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
uh you know that's kind of a

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,280
much bigger problem than just

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
privacy issues and data security issues

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,799
and stuff maybe you guys can talk a

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
little bit about that yeah

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,119
sure so basically i would i would say

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,600
the engineering team at crab was was

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
really very great so like you get a

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
chance to work with a lot of uh great

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,079
engineers where they itself consider

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
security one of the requirements so we

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,360
were never

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
uh so

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
the the engineers were like they're self

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
responsible for security and security

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
was not only see deputy's responsibility

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
so we used to have a secure sdlc wherein

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,879
everyone in in the pipeline is

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,120
responsible for security and which

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
as a part of security team uh was very

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
helpful for us

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
so we were not there to tell them see uh

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
this is something that we need to take

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
care of so they were smart enough to do

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
things by themselves and that is when

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
you get a chance to work on a lot of

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,160
other initiatives which actually helps

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,680
you

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
improve and work on a lot of different

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
initiatives i would say which which

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,440
would be embedded in dsdlc itself and

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
would result in like a lot of cool

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
things how big is the security team now

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,080
i mean i grab

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
which are distributed across different

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
uh across southeast asia and india

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,519
so i mean when for collaborativeness

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
right now that everybody is kind of

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,480
working from home now the security teams

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,599
are kind of spread out all over the

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,080
world how do you guys do coordinated uh

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
kind of like in a bug

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
squashing you know how do you guys fix

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
all the bugs

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,959
yeah actually we have uh we we have uh

89
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,840
so

90
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,799
it's a it's a type of collaborative team

91
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,360
and we have our own teams like we have

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
our application security team we have

93
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
our own compliance team

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,239
we have team that focuses on automation

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,120
so each of the teams uh take take their

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
own responsibility and involves in our

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
collaborative value so uh so work from

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,959
home it depends on you know the local

99
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
restrictions and all uh

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
like we come to office work one day uh

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
in a week or if it is there is no

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
restriction we work remotely

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
the collaboration it was was never a

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,319
problem when we were back there in

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,959
office and it was never a problem even

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
when we were working remotely so it was

107
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
pretty cool

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
yeah it was pretty the same thing like

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,440
yeah difference working you know in the

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,400
office or if you're working from home

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,720
so in terms of like

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
sorry when it comes to software testing

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
and the security testing side of things

114
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,960
right

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
um i don't know does grub actually have

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
uh about the program

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
yeah yes a very good one

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
yeah really all right

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
whatever

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
why have i not heard about this man

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,919
i tell you why right because like way

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
back in the day when grab first started

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
right there was a whole bunch of bugs in

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
the app man like ridiculous amount of

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
bugs man like when i'm talking about my

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,400
taxi right like early early days before

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
it became crap

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
right the app right but it was my taxi

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
uh and so you know i was always

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,919
wondering way back then as then why

131
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,199
didn't you guys have a bubble tea now

132
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,880
you say you do but how i don't know

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,720
about it why is it that like it's not

134
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
widely publicized

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
i believe it's it's more than five years

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
that we have our bug bounty program if

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
i'm not wrong uh it could be six years

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
plus uh

139
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,080
and it was uh one of the top ten

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
programs uh like it's one of the hacker

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,960
ones top ten

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
is quite good i would say right right

143
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
right why didn't you guys run yeah yeah

144
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
i mean like why depend on hacker one i

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
mean grab is so big man like uber

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,800
doesn't depend on hacker 1 or anybody

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
else you know i mean it's like they have

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,280
their own thing right why did you guys

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,599
do that

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
because you know if you look at the

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,199
world platform it really becomes very

152
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
easy to communicate with the researchers

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
so the first set of work is taken by the

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
drivers at hacker1 and uh whenever

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,160
there's something which which requires

156
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,919
an active environment

157
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:06,720
where

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
we come to uh we become a picture

159
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
any cool findings i mean from the six

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
year program that is been running has

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
there been any like major

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,479
vulnerabilities that have been disclosed

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,759
i mean obviously i don't know about it

164
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,880
but

165
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,160
maybe you guys can shed some light on

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
that has there been any uh findings from

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
the researchers

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
significant findings

169
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
so i believe like uh

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
we uh we are having a policy of not

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,520
disclosing the report so maybe that that

172
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
was the reason my if i would have heard

173
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
of the bounty program and grab but but

174
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
as i mentioned like it's one of the top

175
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,240
10 programs on hacker one but yeah so we

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,319
we have a policy of not sharing the

177
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,840
reports publicly

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,919
so that is why i think we might not be

179
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,880
able to share that info

180
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
especially like i am an expert

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
we can definitely uh speak on the uh

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
publicly

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,840
disclose 150 i think

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
so so in terms of like coordinated like

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
uh findings right like if i found a

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
vulnerability in grab app i have to go

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
through hacker one or is there any other

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
mechanism that you guys use or

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
hacker one is we would we would

190
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
we would suggest and request researchers

191
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
to go buy a hacker one but definitely

192
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
like if they are because of some reasons

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
hacker one is not accessible they could

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
they could even reach out their teams

195
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,400
directly but we don't uh if i if i

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,440
recall correctly like we we used to uh

197
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
suggest them to come by a hacker when

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
all because it actually helps and easing

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
up the process a lot

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,080
are you guys doing anything um with like

201
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,840
i mean i'm guessing with ai side of

202
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,360
things right but like you know anything

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
at scale for security are you guys using

204
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,240
any kind of like generative adversarial

205
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
stuff or anything along those lines

206
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,319
yeah actually uh if you look at the

207
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,599
security

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,800
we're uh

209
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
going going maturing in the top of how

210
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
we are doing automation at scale so uh

211
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,919
so we

212
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,160
grab euro it's it's a very

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,199
uh

214
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
very collab

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
it's it's actually a super app it has a

216
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,199
lot of teams and lot of engineering team

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,440
lot of teacher so it's difficult to

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
scale uh you know uh security itself

219
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
it's such a huge team so we are

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,639
actually

221
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,039
in that process where we are automating

222
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,680
the security things and

223
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
you know so that every each and every

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,039
component

225
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
uh that is under grab is

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
is scale in terms of security

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,839
what about like behavior analysis for

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
users anomaly detection like at scale

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,519
right are you guys doing any of those

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,039
kind of things

231
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
yeah yeah yeah yes yeah

232
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,680
can you talk about the about the

233
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
implementation as in is it running in

234
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
amazon i mean how do you guys do it is

235
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
my question you know i mean like without

236
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
giving away the secret sauce right

237
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
we actually don't know much detail

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,440
detailed about it but there's the

239
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
automation team which actually takes

240
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
takes care of on the

241
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
uh all the things

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
so i would say like we have a lot of

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
products which are there but which are

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,480
in-house and in-house develop but like

245
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
those are such sets of confidential

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
projects that we cannot uh discuss about

247
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
but yeah like there are a lot of

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,640
initiatives uh that we were working on

249
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
and as in that mentioned like uh and

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
grab security team was was knowing this

251
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
fact that security can never scale as

252
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
lot of engineering and the only way to

253
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,839
come up with security is and then ensure

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,279
security is

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,360
automation so this was this was

256
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,279
something which was known uh

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,279
very long ago i would say and uh there

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
were a lot of cool automation projects

259
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,120
that we were working on and and when it

260
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
comes to traditional part of it again

261
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,560
there were a lot of interesting projects

262
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,519
that we can definitely not talk about

263
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,880
there are a lot of cool things that were

264
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,240
there i was going to ask you about the

265
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,680
blockchain thing because i heard that

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,760
there was a there was some discussion

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
about building in a blockchain into uh

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
the grab wallet and then like for

269
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,920
storing the values

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,959
is that something you guys are still

271
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,640
working on or you guys have abandoned

272
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
that and you left to jp morgan chase

273
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,600
because that's where the blockchain is

274
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,760
at

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
are you guys doing anything with

276
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,560
blockchain or

277
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
it's not like oh it's confidential we

278
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,399
can't say

279
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,959
like

280
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
when i was working with grab i didn't

281
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
encounter yeah yeah so again like as

282
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,519
yeah so uh

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
lot of folks in the engineering team and

284
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
there will be a set of engineering teams

285
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,880
working on a particular thing so you

286
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
might not be aware of all the things

287
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,959
that are there in the pipeline

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
so that that might be the one thing that

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
uh

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
so personally myself like i i didn't

291
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
heard like i didn't i didn't hear

292
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,640
anything about blockchain back then

293
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
interesting interesting so in terms of

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,399
your sdlc right isn't from the time a

295
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
new feature gets say

296
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
developed and the time that it's

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
actually implemented so that i open my

298
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
grab app and then it works right like

299
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,279
how many months are we talking about

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,959
six months eight months

301
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,440
yes no uh again it's it's it's very

302
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
agile so it can take up to six months or

303
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
it can take a couple of weeks as well

304
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,399
so

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,720
uh these things really are really quite

306
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
fast in crap so they work in a very we

307
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,880
work in a very uh fast manner like uh

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,920
sir so let's take an example tomorrow

309
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
there's some policy change in a specific

310
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
locality and we need to roll out the

311
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
feature so this feature needs to be done

312
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
in couple of weeks a couple of weeks and

313
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
security testing everything will be uh

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,839
you know

315
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,240
every team will work in a collaborative

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
manner and would actually fulfill that

317
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
specific requirement so we don't have

318
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,959
any uh you know perfect timeline that we

319
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
take six months or four months

320
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,800
huh interesting

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,839
yeah

322
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
anyway i don't really have any other

323
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
questions for you guys uh is there

324
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,480
anything you want to talk about i mean

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
is there anything like you know you guys

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,279
are working on in your own personal

327
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,560
projects like it doesn't have to do with

328
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
grab or anything to do with work like is

329
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
there any kind of like cool research

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,839
projects you guys are digging into or

331
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,880
any aspects you want to talk about

332
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,079
or is there a follow-up research on your

333
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
research into web browsers

334
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,639
which you just found

335
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,079
part of me or do you have like a

336
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
follow-up into the research of the

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
webview vulnerability that you just

338
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,639
found yes yes actually uh we we

339
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
are planning to now we have now that we

340
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,040
have touched webview we will plan to

341
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
touch different components within mobile

342
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,600
as well and we'll probably try to you

343
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
know uh so now this was because this was

344
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
our first time reporting a bug to google

345
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
so this ended up being uh no severity

346
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,760
issue we'll look for other issues with

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
it it has a huge impact on probably will

348
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
come up with a critical or hybrid in the

349
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,959
future when you were working with google

350
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,720
right like how was in your opinion i

351
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
mean how was the process was it easy not

352
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
so easy painful

353
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
so we really loved the way that we

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,240
worked with google if you look at the

355
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
process you know in hacker one or per

356
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
party program uh

357
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
most of the time uh you would get a

358
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
single line answer that you have been

359
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,000
trying to fix but in case of google

360
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
there was if you actually look at the

361
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
disclosure there's a very long

362
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
conversation which is going on with them

363
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
as well as we are also you know replying

364
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
them with different sets of you know

365
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
scenarios with different sets of image

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
initiative the

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
uh you the

368
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,040
experience was very good with them which

369
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
which helped us to know you know what

370
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
are the different uh factors or what are

371
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
the different policies that they are

372
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,399
actually

373
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
following or what are the new things

374
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,399
like for example they said

375
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,320
they wanted to collect metrics on what

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
happened to the sensitive header and

377
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
then they said that they want to have a

378
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
test case to actually check if this

379
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
uh you know if this fix would work or

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
not so

381
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,320
that's where the learning comes in so

382
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
there was a lot of learning with the

383
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,440
interaction that we had with google

384
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,959
cool so i mean overall you would say

385
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,839
it's relatively positive right

386
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,079
yeah yeah yeah it was

387
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
all right

388
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,639
