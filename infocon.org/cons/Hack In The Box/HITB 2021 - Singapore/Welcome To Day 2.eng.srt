32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
interviews with uh speakers so like for

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
example we're talking to paul when he's

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,880
done

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
and in between that you know um we've

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,479
got some catch up with some usual

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
suspect guys

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,119
uh later on in the evening the ctf folks

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,400
will be joining us in the studio uh and

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
we'll be talking a little bit about

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
the edu capture the flag uh game that's

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
supposed to be happening uh after the

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,320
conference ends today

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
um what is the cdu game what is the edu

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,960
game that's a good question that's a

46
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,240
good question so

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,119
uh

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,000
we

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
we wanted to do obviously an in-person

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
conference right so normally we do our

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
capture the flag and it's a single

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
player or you know a team-based

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
jeopardy-style game

54
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,159
uh however when we do our final contest

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
in uae it's actually uh

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
attacking defense

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,040
and a lot of the student teams um who

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
have tried to participate in the past

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
find that a huge challenge because it's

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
completely different from playing

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
jeopardy right i mean japanese style gtf

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,399
is

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,840
kind of like a walk in the park in

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
comparison to attack and defense where

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,800
you have to collaborate with it with

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,560
your teammates and communication is kind

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
of like key and then you know having

68
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,640
predefined roles it's very much like

69
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
e-gaming if you guys follow like dota 2

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
style right like each player that's on

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
the team of five right has a has a role

72
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
uh and so the edu ctf uh for this round

73
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,080
is actually um going to act as a

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
qualifier so the teams that that have

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,400
played the capture the flag that's going

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
to be running uh this evening

77
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,599
are the top three teams right we're

78
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
going to fly them over to disciple week

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
so that they get a chance to play with

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
uh with the big boys right with the pro

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
guys uh who are going to be hand

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,319
selected so we're kind of like you know

83
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,720
working this out to have a platform for

84
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
them to kind of like move towards so

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
we're calling it like road to pro ctf

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,800
finals

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
uh so it should be quite exciting i mean

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
uh there's gonna be a scoreboard you

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
guys can follow that along uh i think

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
it's like 125 120 odd teams uh

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
registered

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
um can they still register or no no

93
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,560
registration is closed unfortunately

94
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,680

119
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,599
i don't envy them because it's always a

120
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,319
challenge especially uh you know hrtv

121
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,959
ctf is kind of known as uh

122
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,120
not so easy

123
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
so yeah uh

124
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,239
