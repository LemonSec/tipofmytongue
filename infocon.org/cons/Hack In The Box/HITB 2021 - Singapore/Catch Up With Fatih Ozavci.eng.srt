1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,320
what's up guys we're back

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
uh we've got a

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,480
quick chat catch up with fatih zafchi uh

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
you guys attended his lab yesterday he

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,880
did a session on tradecraft development

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,080
was

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,279
pretty interesting

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,800
and uh he's going to be speaking again

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
today at uh three o'clock this afternoon

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,880
on malware protocol simulations and

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,599
distributed networks uh bro you're there

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,599
man

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,680
yeah uh and good afternoon thank you for

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
giving me this opportunity first of all

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,480
uh last night was a busy night for me

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
because of the time zone difference we

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,840
started at 10 pm it ended around uh i

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
think uh 12 30 a.m or about to go

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
so

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
it was fun uh it was funny event um i

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,559
actually released some uh code uh that's

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
why uh i was actually

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
uh preparing with that code and showing

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
the uh how it works and etc etc anyway

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
uh tbi is the repository so yesterday we

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
worked on it it was fun um yeah that's

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,799
the first talk uh the second one is

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
today actually we turn our as you

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,280
referred mother and mother protocol

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
simulations in distributed networks so

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,479
yeah that's that's the thing and your

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,080
specialization is actually in tradecraft

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,759
development right like i'm just reading

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,520
your latest bio i mean for the guys who

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
don't know right like uh you spoke in

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,439
2015. so we've known each other for

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
quite a while actually but we haven't

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,759
had you back at hack in the box for well

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,200
since 2015. i believe it was the last

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
time you spoke right

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
yeah uh in 2015 uh i have uh i have been

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,079
in singapore uh for skype for business

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
research i have actually uh dropped four

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
zero days in that point

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
and yeah uh i didn't of course release

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
all the details but uh i needed to drop

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,920
as well uh it was fun um for skype for

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
business research was good uh it was six

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
years ago

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
after that i started working for

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
some financial institutions as they have

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
some regulations uh they didn't exactly

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
allow me to talk about

54
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,319
uh vulnerabilities more like procedures

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
and etc so my direction changed from

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,959
hacking the box to elsewhere

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
recently i joined uh the missing link so

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
it gives me additional consultancy

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
options so i'm currently using my

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
advisory simulation skills as well as

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
tradecraft development skills for big

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,040
clients and they encourage me to

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
actually release vulnerabilities and

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
tools this time so

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
after five years it's a change for me uh

66
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
that's why i recently started sharing my

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
work with uh everyone as well that's a

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
great opportunity so everybody has it i

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
mean like you know the fact that people

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
don't like their researchers releasing

71
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
exploits i don't know why that would be

72
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
so because you know it's uh

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
it's cool man

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
so it's great it's great to hear that

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,599
like yeah you've been able to do what

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,800
you love and

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
you know

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
get to enjoy it

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
yeah thank you so um so now that you've

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
been and i mean i'm like everybody else

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
right you've been in lockdown undercover

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
like how's things been with regards to

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
work i mean i had a lot of things

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
changed with like

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
the nature of work for you guys that's

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,440
that's

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,959
he actually that's an interesting

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
question because normally we don't speak

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,360
about our private clients but i'm quite

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
open with that uh because in melbourne

91
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
we stayed in uh lucktown for eight

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,879
months last year

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,040
uh eight months and that lockdown was

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
actually like time so we couldn't go out

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,159
we couldn't walk uh only one hour of uh

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,720
sport break but that's it so simply it

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,879
was a kind of restriction for us and

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
this year interestingly uh

99
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
is back because also sydney uh

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
actually uh sydney had issues that's why

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
they have some case numbers going up

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
that's why we are in lag time actually

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
for almost one and a half months uh we

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,879
were in lockdown i'm still in laptop

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
after 9pm it turns to curfew uh that's

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,280
why

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
i try to focus on a couple of things one

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
is adversary development uh that was

109
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,239
good for me that's why i'm trying to

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,239
make everything available to everyone as

111
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,320
well as keeping their licenses in mit

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,478
and bsd-like licenses so they can

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,639
repurpose and use in several different

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,519
ways

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
to uplift the defense and offense also

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
i've worked uh

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
in a couple of things in addition to my

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,240
study i started a master uh master of

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
cyber security which helped me to keep

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
my mental health and focus on some uh

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,160
university stuff also i adopted the dog

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
that that's another oh nice

123
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,520
[Laughter]

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,800
um

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
not really but do you want to just give

126
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
us uh do you want to tell us what your

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
talk is going to be about um

128
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
talk after this sure yeah so you could

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,639
give the audience a sneak peek of it

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,440
and

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,919
during my study in master of cyber

132
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,720
security university of new south wales

133
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,919
um i realized that cyber health is uh

134
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,880
having

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,680
that actually a study area has

136
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
difficulties regarding that malware

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
traffic generation or malware or

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
advisory simulations the reason being is

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
actually they have no access to most of

140
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,600
our tools even though we assume that

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
everybody has github repository access

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,919
everybody has commercial source the real

143
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
world doesn't like this and they almost

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,680
hate almost all offensive researchers

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
for a couple of reasons because our

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,440
tools are used by adversaries

147
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
and uh some of the commercial tools are

148
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,600
not available to analytics and defense

149
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
people for example as a defense uh

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,120
company

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
you can't actually buy cobalt's track

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,800
they don't allow you to buy it if you

153
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
are an offensive company

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
or something like that you have access

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
to

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,759
but advisories always have this type of

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,840
access they can retrieve the files and

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
they can move on and et cetera so this

159
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
kind of this was the kind of dilemma for

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
me and i changed my direction to

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
actually simulating those advisory

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,880
behaviors safely

163
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
i was

164
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
actually developing some adversary packs

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
for people to simulate all those

166
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,919
activities safely and even i have

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,639
developed a tool called tassat

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,639
which is actually generating malware

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,600
traffic

170
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
with an implant

171
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
and that implant is quite friendly

172
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,400
because it doesn't have any hostile

173
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,280
capabilities it only replicates the

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,199
traffic you

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
shared with that or you designed like a

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,720
profile

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
the features are

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
slightly easy to use using a graphical

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,280
user interface like cobalt swag covenant

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
or mythic and etc define a profile for

181
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
the service and then generate the

182
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
service the command and control service

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,560
and generate an implant for it

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
it was simple like that when you make it

185
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
complicated you can actually distribute

186
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
this to your uh let's say uh

187
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
more complex networks that includes vpcs

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
in cloud data centers hypervisor

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
networks and etc

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
moreover you may need multiple protocols

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
to simulate there so tessa is most

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,599
friendly version of i also identified

193
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,599
one more weakness there

194
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
even though they understand some of our

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
tools especially defense people

196
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,120
they are pretty good to uplift the

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
defense but they

198
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,880
they need guidance because they have

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
trade intelligence reports

200
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,639
they have tools

201
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
but they don't actually connect them

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,759
together

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,039
that's why i decided to generate uh

204
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,960
another advisory simulation pack last

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
year

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
this was called ta505

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,759
plus so simply ga 505 activated battery

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,000
was targeting australia those days so we

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
simply changed our point of view and i

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
said that what if we improve all of our

211
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,440
network

212
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
just like going to one year later

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
everything is cutting edge all defense

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
products are up for example windows

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,120
defender office 2019 sandbox enabled in

216
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
office uh some software policies

217
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
everything is set so what could they do

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,080
with that assumption i developed an

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
advisory simulation pack for them

220
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
and i actually supplied this pack

221
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,599
as a kind of ready to go simulation

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
and it worked well and after that

223
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
actually i have received some positive

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
feedback as a result this test malware

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
traffic generation tool

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
has been developed i released two white

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,719
papers for it

228
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
to explain how it works how we can make

229
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,159
it safe

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
but define depending on defense level if

231
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,440
you are an instant responder or digital

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,399
forensics level technical person you can

233
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
use the advisory simulation pack and

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
attack or the blind implantment i

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,920
released yesterday or if you are cyber

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,720
analytics looking for a safe tool to

237
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
simulate traffic

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
or train your product then that's that

239
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
is your aspect so i combine all of those

240
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
in my call i will try to explain

241
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,519
everything to the defense people at

242
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,680
different levels giving some uh

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,399
demonstrations uh but the talk is of

244
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,640
course limited with one hour but even

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
one demo is 40 minutes

246
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
i actually linked that one

247
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
cool man and hey how many people are

248
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
developing this too man is just you or

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
do you have a team of developers or

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
actually

251
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
i am alone

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
that helps me to

253
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
learn

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
faster okay but i'm keeping all the

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,480
tools

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
as well as i invite people to uh

257
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
contribute those projects but everybody

258
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
is releasing co2s uh commandant controls

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,880
using implants so

260
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
it is easy to see a lot of people

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,959
contributing or changing the calls but

262
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,560
this doesn't mean that

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
they necessarily share it with me that's

264
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
why i don't receive a lot of pull

265
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,760
requests

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,640
but i receive feedback that is uh

267
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
actually actually my motivation is that

268
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
one because i receive feedback people

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
say that i use this tool in my defense

270
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
product against this and this and this

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
it didn't work can you please tune this

272
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,680
up or i use this advisory simulation

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
pack but it didn't work and etc so

274
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
they instead of submitting code

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,079
they feed me with ideas requests or uh

276
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
some feedback they say that okay your

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
tool is so offensive we couldn't get

278
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,959
approval from the compliance

279
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
that was the uh

280
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,240
actually most important criticism uh

281
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
for a c2 because pataxes use a malware

282
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
and c2 environment and they say that no

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
we can't use this in our cyber analytics

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
compliance doesn't allow us to run a

285
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,959
malware so i changed the approach and

286
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
the sat is coming from there

287
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,480
so

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
that is the

289
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
work and how i communicate with the

290
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
public and community and people

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
on the other hand for development

292
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,079
perspective

293
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
i learned through development

294
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,519
that helped me a lot because

295
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
i don't know most of the protocols

296
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,680
systems or windows internals or network

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,240
internals uh work that's why i try to

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
use different techniques

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
to understand that

300
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
but none of those uh was beneficial if

301
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
you compare with the programming because

302
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
i i need to program something i need to

303
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
simulate everything i have to read the

304
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,959
document and uh all of those uh pressure

305
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
simply end with knowing things better

306
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,399
such as how windows internals work

307
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
why the defense products fail to how we

308
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,480
can improve the defense product because

309
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
now i know that they are actually

310
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
monitoring us on our shoulder and they

311
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,160
change the addresses in the processing

312
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,440
environment blog

313
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,079
or a trading environment block so

314
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,040
we simply see that so how we can change

315
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
this how we can use dynamic resolution

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,279
how we can improve those products as

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,600
well so my work is hybrid these days

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
last four years i have focused on this

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
part it is hybrid now of offensive and

320
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
defensive capabilities at the same time

321
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
and programming is the key uh actually

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
sticking all these together

323
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,079
that's cool man so in terms of your

324
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,839
development roadmap like do you publish

325
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,360
that anywhere as in in terms of where

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
you would like the tool to be say in i

327
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
don't know six months 12 months by your

328
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,760
own

329
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
development plan

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
um

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,920
actually i i couldn't use it

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,279
because i have

333
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
multiple tools to work however those

334
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
tools are not supported by any

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,680
commercial

336
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,560
organization not my company i work for

337
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,120
or not my previous employers

338
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
everybody wants to see those type of

339
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
tools but

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,240
contribution is limited that's why i

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
need to use my private time to do that

342
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,839
um

343
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
that actually limits my commitment

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
that plan actually relates to the

345
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
commitment because if i give a

346
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,200
commitment saying that i will develop

347
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,600
this tool for for example next two years

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
and this is the roadmap and that's where

349
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,880
i'm going to uh and those are the plans

350
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,519
i need to follow that commitment but i i

351
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,120
develop all these tools in my private

352
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
time and i don't know what future will

353
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
bring me

354
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
because my business life and

355
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,360
work style has been changed a couple of

356
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
times last five years

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,959
jumping between the companies

358
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,200
working as an independent researcher

359
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
then

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
jumping back to consultancy

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
everything has a different requirement

362
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,600
but open source tools uh need people

363
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,880
behind of them

364
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
and to be dedicated that's why i really

365
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
admire some of the open source

366
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,120
developers

367
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
stick behind of their tools make it

368
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,920
actually beneficial for everyone as

369
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
supporting them with some uh commercial

370
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
activities for example marcelo author of

371
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,839
silent trinity

372
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,800
is a good example he actually used a lot

373
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
of good things to

374
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
harness their tools the same for daniel

375
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
dagen as well i really admire those

376
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
people and how they manage their open

377
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
source products and roadmaps i'm not

378
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
able to do that unfortunately because of

379
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
my uh

380
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
nature of my job

381
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,839
yeah it's interesting you bring that up

382
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,320
because uh like the guys from chilling

383
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
project so kaijan lao from chilling

384
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,199
uh he has a team of guys that also

385
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,600
contributing code but he was saying that

386
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,399
the

387
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,160
bulk of the contribution are made by a

388
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
very small subset group of people and

389
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,320
the only reason why he can focus his

390
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
attention on it is because he doesn't

391
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
need to it's funded by at least not

392
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,399
commercially funded but his research

393
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,240
time that he spends on building

394
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
enhancements to chilling it's paid for

395
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
and then he can use company time right

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
like to to work on that but have you

397
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
considered like you know i know even he

398
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,560
said donations don't work but

399
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
maybe that could be like you know if you

400
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,600
want a particular feature you pay for it

401
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,360
you know what i mean like it's developer

402
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,040
time after all right and you can you

403
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,720
could put a dollar value on that right

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
one hour or you know this this feature

405
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,560
takes three days right and it's gonna

406
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
cost this much and if enough people you

407
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
know donate bitcoin or whatever towards

408
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,600
it

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,279
then you would be able to do it or if

410
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,880
not hire somebody else to do it right

411
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
which is uh the other which is why i

412
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,600
asked whether there's anybody else

413
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,000
working on it

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
um

415
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
currently uh

416
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
the answer for almost all of those is

417
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
now

418
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,079
but i i i

419
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,600
am considering some uh patreon uh or uh

420
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,320
similar environments uh to be used for

421
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
uh trainings for example ga 505 uh was a

422
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
good simulation pack coming with more

423
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,440
than four

424
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
four and a half hours video

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
including a large documentation set and

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,720
all the samples customized code and it

427
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,199
was actually a work built of other

428
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
people as well so i didn't want to get

429
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
any uh profit there that's why i

430
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,320
released this tool but again i i spent

431
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,199
almost weeks for it uh not only one or

432
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,920
uh two weeks i i just added more a day

433
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
data every day and i made it uh

434
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,120
beneficial and to be used by everyone

435
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
but if i require a sort of money for

436
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
that project it wouldn't work

437
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,040
it would work uh however for

438
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
for example attack or tassat malware

439
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,320
generator

440
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
malware traffic generator because those

441
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
are tools instead of simulation projects

442
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,399
tools would work

443
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
and will fit in that uh

444
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
picture

445
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,600
um i think

446
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,759
best approach uh

447
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,759
best approach would be marcelo's and

448
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,320
daniel's approach such as using patreon

449
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,959
or github donations or something like

450
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,440
that to support open source project

451
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
using a twitch or similar environments

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
to shoulder research show the content

453
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
accept the submissions or feature

454
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
requests from the patreons uh

455
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,440
or uh

456
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,160
some people's uh let's say

457
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
subscribe to your channel or something

458
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,560
like that then except from them and then

459
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,199
build things on the way that that is an

460
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,880
extra that could be done uh i have uh

461
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,600
some interest there i can't do that uh

462
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,440
but i'm still considering all the

463
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,519
options is it too beneficial or not

464
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
because lots of c2s out there and lots

465
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
of development is happening

466
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,439
also maybe it's a good idea to say that

467
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,199
there's also a commercial organization

468
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,559
as kind

469
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,280
sky is providing purple team tools their

470
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
own tools for advisory simulations and

471
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
et cetera and they announced also a

472
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
community program uh for these type of

473
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,919
developers to submit tools to work with

474
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,480
that uh environment commercially so

475
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,799
there are some solutions integrated to

476
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,039
commercial companies or

477
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,440
open source development environments uh

478
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
using patreon or github and etc

479
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
there are some twitch streaming uh some

480
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,960
of my friends already use this for

481
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,600
collecting some benefits and interests

482
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,760
so those are lots of options

483
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,640
and i'm still observing uh because this

484
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
is a kind of huge commitment and

485
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,840
previously i

486
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
maintained v-pro for uh i think five

487
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,000
years

488
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,919
and during the

489
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,960
actually

490
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
six years in public uh two years in

491
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,000
private as well in total eight years uh

492
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
for all service provider networks

493
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,880
unified communications and etc and it

494
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
had a toll on me

495
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,720
and it didn't actually

496
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,840
pay back it was more like a research to

497
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,480
be published and uh i got

498
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
admired that was good i received lots of

499
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
good feedback but it didn't pay itself

500
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,559
so

501
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,320
at a certain point i needed to terminate

502
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,880
it i needed to leave it to die

503
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
and today even uh you can't use it

504
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,280
because the metasploit version has been

505
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
drastically changed and lots of things

506
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
are irrelevant and i still receive some

507
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
emails saying that i want to use vpro

508
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
against this type of uh wi-fi

509
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,480
environment or uac

510
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,039
environment and etc and my answer is no

511
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,039
it doesn't work anymore find the number

512
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
two so who's currently uh

513
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
pushing the the i mean you talk about

514
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,080
vip tools right right so who's taken up

515
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,440
the role of

516
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,640
of building the next the next uh vipro i

517
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
mean like

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
is anybody doing anything or they just

519
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
forget about it

520
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
as far as i know um

521
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,720
one one or two uh other tools uh if

522
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
you're uh

523
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,480
and they disappear as well somebody

524
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
branches uh simplicious is always there

525
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,919
but see precious has lots of limitations

526
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,840
i haven't used commercial version of it

527
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,080
sandra also provides that one maybe

528
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
sandro is an example he's a good friend

529
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,000
as well so that is one um js nostrom has

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,120
uh

531
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
quit playing with a voiceover ip2 and

532
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
he's a science instructor now so this

533
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
jason will develop some tools uh he had

534
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,640
some tools for link uh those days it was

535
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,400
linked then renamed as skype for

536
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,440
business

537
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
um

538
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah i think also mr c

539
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
developed a turkish

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
team development team so uh mr sip will

541
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
be an alternative for it but everything

542
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,919
uh comes with a different point of view

543
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
because developers are different so

544
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,360
there is no next report there are

545
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,240
additional and way more better uh much

546
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,440
much better

547
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,919
voiceover tools out there he pro is that

548
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,880
simply

549
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,600
i i literally i had to

550
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,799
you actually mentioned a really good

551
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,559
point earlier on there are multiple c2

552
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,320
frameworks available and i think if you

553
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
see on twitter every other week or month

554
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
a new c2 framework is being released by

555
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,000
a different uh

556
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
uh security expert right are there

557
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,000
overlaps between these different c2s is

558
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
there really a need for this many c2

559
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
framework projects to be released right

560
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,799
or even as defenders right

561
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
um are they supposed to test uh their

562
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
defense against every single c2

563
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,559
framework or is that just like um how do

564
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,679
you say uh

565
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,799
a few

566
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,280
minor ttps that you look out after and

567
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,840
it might cover a few of it

568
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,400
what

569
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
maybe i should take this question in a

570
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
couple of categories right sure i can

571
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,360
give you a developer feedback i can give

572
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,600
you the fast feedback and i can give you

573
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,159
a user feedback as well for development

574
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,880
uh point of view i had to develop attack

575
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
c2 for a couple of reasons one is

576
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,400
the signature management because it

577
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,720
it was brand new and i was using it very

578
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,280
well with no detections and etc so it

579
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,360
was good so i decided to make it public

580
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,919
as well because uh it worked in my uh

581
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
environment and i decided to custom i

582
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,000
customize it and

583
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,679
i saw that there is no directions if i

584
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,960
customize it

585
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
so it is streaming so i release this for

586
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,159
everyone the second uh reason for this

587
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,039
uh development was automation

588
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,720
i needed to automate my activities

589
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,799
because i'm a red teamer when i perform

590
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,080
an exercise it takes weeks months

591
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,000
and defense

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
has no idea what's going on if it is

593
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,559
purple team things change they see

594
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,159
collaboration but they still need to

595
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,760
replicate this action

596
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
when they perform a remediation a

597
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,039
mitigation process they still need us to

598
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
test them but i don't want to repeat

599
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,480
again and again

600
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
myself it's not a kind of a good

601
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,080
approach second thing is i need to

602
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
update them the attack

603
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
c2 has automation capability

604
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,120
that can actually engage them

605
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
to work on the exercise items i have

606
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
used so those two things automation as

607
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
well as uh the signature motivated me

608
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
for the taxi too but it is so premature

609
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,760
and it is not in um it doesn't claim to

610
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
be a next

611
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
covenant next mythic or next combat

612
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
strike it is more like

613
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
how can we deploy a c2 to get the

614
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,559
initial foothold

615
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,280
then decide what we to do

616
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,799
next

617
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
because we copper strike is your

618
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,360
interactive uh c2 but you have different

619
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,159
layers of kill chain so

620
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,880
attack has a spot in the earlier

621
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
compromise actually the blind

622
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,600
implantment i released yesterday is a

623
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
good one

624
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,559
actually the repository is available in

625
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,240
my github uh also uh the tool uh and

626
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,320
the content has been have been released

627
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
last night

628
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,840
tbi is the repository so this branch

629
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,000
implantment is not a situ

630
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
it is an implant

631
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
looking for

632
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
some modules and extended memory growing

633
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,840
memory what it does is simply loading

634
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,640
another.net assembly looking for

635
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
available instructions load them

636
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,840
then use operate

637
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,799
to run them so simply as an implant you

638
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,520
have

639
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
no features other than the skeleton of

640
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,159
it

641
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
and it runs because it is simple and

642
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
safe and it actually downloads

643
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,159
an image from an image share site okay

644
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
whatever you choose your favorite one

645
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
so you upload an image there and it

646
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
retrieves the proper image just like

647
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,200
stenography but it's end of the file so

648
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
it retrieves the encrypted contact from

649
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
there and loads this in memory again and

650
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
loads as an assembly discovers

651
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
the method called for example get

652
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,559
instructions

653
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,840
and it says that okay i have new

654
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,799
features now so it extends your memory

655
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
and it gives you a lot of different

656
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
modules my examples were more like

657
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
injection assembly laws uh

658
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,679
encrypted or decrypted content whatever

659
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
assembly you want to run remote or

660
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,919
things so you don't need any c2 your co2

661
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
is an image service or something like

662
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
that so this is a proof of concept

663
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,480
response

664
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
so when you release a c2

665
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
it should have a reason so this header

666
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
reason this was going uh to subtle uh

667
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
compromise just like the no value for

668
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
the solar gate exercise you shouldn't

669
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,360
be able to identify your compromise

670
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,880
you need to have an implant and the

671
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
implant must be a slippery cell that was

672
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,760
the reason

673
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,360
for defense perspective on the other

674
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
hand lots of cities

675
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,159
and it's not a great idea to see lots of

676
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,480
cqs for the adversaries because

677
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
they have a lot of tools on the other

678
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,000
hand

679
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
let's be honest defense people

680
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,679
have enormous budgets

681
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
i i haven't seen those budgets like that

682
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
in any offensive capability at all

683
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
so when you work for a bank you can see

684
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,480
easily 10 millions of dollars spent to

685
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,279
defense and offensive capability is

686
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,520
taking for example only uh maybe

687
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,039
hundreds of thousand dollars maybe one

688
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,240
or two

689
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
so that is a kind of limitation so

690
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
adversaries are actually mitigating that

691
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
using the open source tools such as c2s

692
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,279
and etc so defense people uh

693
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,400
don't like it but they don't actually

694
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
contribute to the offensive people and

695
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
try to make it improve together they

696
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
stick on their own area that's why

697
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
actually offensive people are

698
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
not hybrid like me they are more like

699
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,240
red full red actually crimson that's why

700
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
uh almost all tools are developed as an

701
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
offensive point of view

702
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,799
um one last thing as a user i really

703
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,400
appreciate those tools

704
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,840
because i use that

705
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,880
and i try to admire uh the authors i say

706
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,919
that

707
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,679
they are really good

708
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,159
i i can easily see that daniel duggan or

709
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,120
uh

710
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,400
ryan kopp

711
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
uh rafael march they do a really great

712
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,080
job and there's a reason for every situ

713
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
they demonstrate their capabilities for

714
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,480
example brute retal is another ct and

715
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,960
malware environment and he releases a

716
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,840
really good tool in sea but he is after

717
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,799
his trainings so his uh main motivation

718
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
is the trainings and the content and et

719
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
cetera so not the malware itself so

720
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
different motivations as you see uh as a

721
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,240
developer as a user as a defense person

722
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,480
in my point of view some are really good

723
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,919
and i'm really

724
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,120
inspired of most of those

725
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,919
cool man hey bro we probably have to say

726
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,679
goodbye in a little bit actually i think

727
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,080
we've got like about three minutes left

728
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,960
uh

729
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
just personally do you have any plans to

730
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
travel for the rest of this year or

731
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,240
no

732
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
stay at home

733
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
i i really love to

734
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,480
however the australian government simply

735
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,880
started giving only written permissions

736
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,000
for certain reasons so

737
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
there is no

738
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,679
uh international travel uh in near

739
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
future i think 2022

740
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,480
uh maybe june so simply eight months or

741
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,799
so they won't allow us to travel they

742
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
will see the vaccines and environment

743
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,440
and et cetera i hope this

744
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,679
this doesn't go that way because

745
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,120
i'm really stuck in australia to be

746
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
honest uh i'm

747
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,720
i recently

748
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,640
become and i was trying only one and a

749
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,919
half years ago

750
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,240
i'm coming from europe i love europe so

751
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
i'd like to go back

752
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,520
but i'm impressed

753
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,559
now

754
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,480
australia so no international travel

755
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
otherwise i will be in singapore anyway

756
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,640
and you know that i love singapore as

757
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,679
well

758
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
well bro we hopefully you know things

759
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
change and we can see you back again in

760
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,520
amsterdam at least uh next year in i

761
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,039
think in the spring is when we plan to

762
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
do it if not likewise after june you'll

763
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
be singapore so yeah we'll see you in 0

764
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
then i guess

765
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
uh likewise i will keep this in mind as

766
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,679
well and i will keep an eye on it uh if

767
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,320
