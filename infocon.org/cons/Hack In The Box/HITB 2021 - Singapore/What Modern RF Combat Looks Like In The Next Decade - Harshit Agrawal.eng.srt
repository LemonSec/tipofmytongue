1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,280
so i really appreciate and grateful for

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,679
being here thank you hitp team for

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
giving me opportunity to share my work

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,920
from this platform my title of this

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
presentation is gazing ahead what modern

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
rf combat will looks like in the next

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
decade so imagine robotic tanks that

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,800
maneuver themselves across desert

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,380
terrain avoiding lane mines

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,469
[Music]

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,680
thank you cooper

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,079
so i really appreciate and grateful for

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,000
being here thank you to hitv team

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
so in this presentation we will be

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,559
discussing about soldiers uniform like

16
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,840
what are the different sensors

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,719
integrated and the iot warfare like

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,079
internet of battlefield things

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,840
convergence of cyber and electronic

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
warfare jamming rf focused drones

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
counter techniques and some of the case

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
studies so quickly moving forward what

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
do you think of a wall where every

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
device you own is containing with each

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
other to do your daily task you open

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
your eyes in the morning and a device is

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,479
telling you the whole list of talks you

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
need to perform today also you give

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,799
instruction through your mobile phone

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
and your coffee is ready while you get

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
ready for the office so where cctv

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
cameras can identify and stop excessive

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
force before it turns deadly

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
to wearing sensors which report with

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
real-time health data to alert patients

36
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
to emergencies before they happen

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,640
even as drones which is being used to

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
support first responder iot has

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
transformational impact on our life

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
across vertical sectors so there's a

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,759
whole thing of task that iot is helping

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,560
us with so we can say a world without

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
iot is like living in a stone age

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
it may seems like a big claim for some

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
of you but when you see the bits of iot

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
reflected in every mutant task of our

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,040
daily life you will agree to it so how

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
important is the internet of things in

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,280
our life and even question is how secure

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
you think it is

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
so in this slide you can see the benefit

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,080
of iot are undeniable

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,879
iot can bring much of the physical world

54
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,200
from industrial assets to commonplace

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
devices to people into a connected

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
ecosystem

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
resulting in enhanced customer

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
experience in a better business outcomes

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
so increased connectivity and

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
digitization in industry has produced an

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,000
exponentially expanding attack surface

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
behind which is safety security and

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
critical services so cars are now

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,640
turning into computer on wheels and

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
airplanes have become flying data center

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
but this increase in power and

67
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,040
connectivity has largely happened

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
without designing inadequate security

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
protocols so for example iot can improve

70
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,879
multiple aspects of an airport such as

71
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,280
by regulating traffic flow and helping

72
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
passengers navigating using wi-fi

73
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,159
beacons nfc tech and geolocation

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,840
streamlining security checkpoints with

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,879
biometry like facial recognition and

76
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
inducing the number of lost bits using

77
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
electronic luggage state and sensors so

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
given the potential and influence that

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
iot has on the wall it is worth looking

80
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
at the security risk associated with

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,680
these devices

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
so in simple words uh internet of things

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
is a broad network of connected physical

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
objects all devices that communicate

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
with each other and exchange data

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
without human interference so generally

87
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,560
all these devices are capable of

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,959
collecting data processing information

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
and transferring data

90
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
so iot is wonderful in many ways but

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,159
unfortunately technology has not matured

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
yet and it is not entirely safe the

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
entire iot environment from manufacturer

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,599
to user still have many security

95
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
challenges to overcome such as

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,599
manufacturing standards update

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,400
management uh physical hardening user

98
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,040
knowledge and awareness so now it is not

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,760
only with us or our computer but there

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
are also things that interact with the

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,160
internet without our intention

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
these things are

103
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,880
continually communicating with the

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
internet of fridge sending an update of

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
the food inside or our vehicle

106
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
transmitting message to the mechanic to

107
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
inform of its oil level

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
so here we can see in certain sense

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
sudan is like a guy who works throughout

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
the city and knocks on every door he

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,000
sees

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
but instead of door soda knocks on every

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
ipv4 address and instead of some city

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
there is the whole world so if you ask

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
that guy about a particular type of door

116
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,880
or about door in a particular part of

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
the city he certainly would know

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,479
something and would provide you the

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,639
information how many of those doors are

120
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,600
there who answer them and who what do

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
they say so so down gives you the same

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
information about these iot items how

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
are they called what type of are they

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,919
and is there any web interface one can

125
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
use so there is no problem of knocking

126
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
on door unless you find the out that

127
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
there are a lot of door with no look and

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
no one can stop the bed guy from baking

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
in so on the other hand census is also a

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
search engine for the iot relying on the

131
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
same basic principle but it's more

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
precise when it comes to searching for

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,400
vulnerabilities so oh yes uh senses can

134
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,479
actually give you a list of devices with

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,280
a particular vulnerability for example

136
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
are those vulnerable to hard bleed so if

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
it's an ip address you can see

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,759
everything it sees and even control it

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
if it supports something like that if

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,759
it's a router you can change its setting

141
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,680
if it's a baby monitor you can talk to

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
the poor baby in a scary voice so it's

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,120
all up to your moral uh standards so

144
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
here we can see the common cia triad for

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,800
iot security where c for confidentiality

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,919
authentic authenticity and integrity now

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
the main thing is uh confidentiality

148
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
ensures like how is iot information

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
secured so at rest it can be a very rare

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
integrity which means what integrating

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
methods are used and availabilities like

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
how is availability assured so we need

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
to make sure like our iot a lot of iot

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,160
devices are extremely small in size and

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,479
pole into the category of low resources

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
devices or constrained resource devices

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
so their physical limitations allow them

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
to process low power resources only

159
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
which makes adding more layer of

160
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
security difficult so there is a

161
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,080
serious tradeoff between security and

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,800
resources when it comes to iot and it's

163
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
more complicated when we discuss about

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
the internet of battlefield things

165
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
so

166
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,800
ensuring that each device has the

167
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
control to maintain data confidentiality

168
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
and integrity within an organization is

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,240
necessary so in addition investigation

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
of iot security along with data

171
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,400
integrity holds practical significance

172
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,199
in iot development so on the right side

173
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
you can see pyramid of pain which is

174
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
based on cisco iot reference model and

175
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,639
it is evaluated from a vulnerability

176
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
perspective of the iot system so the

177
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
most vulnerable part of the iot system

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,039
with the least impact if support and

179
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
attack is placed on the top of the

180
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
pyramid sensors sit on the top as they

181
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
are the most vulnerable being the most

182
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
accessible part of the iot ecosystem the

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,120
next vulnerable part is the

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
communication between sensors and

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
accumulated data by the sensors the

186
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
attackers can get access to these data

187
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,759
through sensors or by getting into the

188
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,800
network

189
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
then comes the hardware extraction and

190
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
firmware which stipulates application

191
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
programming interface for the

192
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
interaction between the application and

193
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,919
the data lastly the least accessible

194
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
part at the bottom of the pyramid is

195
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,960
hardware platform such as soap fpga dsp

196
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
and etc so even through the hardware

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
platform which is at the bottom of the

198
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
pyramid it is also one of the uh that

199
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,800
deserves most uh major attract attention

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
before it has the highest damage impact

201
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
to a system in case of an attack so it

202
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
can be said that hardware is the

203
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,240
foundation of the iot system in the most

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,319
pain-posing part in the case of a cyber

205
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,479
attack incident so therefore iot

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
security should begin with the high

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,039
hardware security

208
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,120
now let's see some of the cases studies

209
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,199
like how iot devices can be considered

210
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,240
in the defense so for example

211
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
at iot uh sorry department of defense

212
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
fuel report tank level temperature and

213
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,039
flow roads could be inexpensively and

214
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,599
precisely monitored inventory usage and

215
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,360
payment could be easily integrated with

216
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,919
the backend business systems perimeter

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
security could be enhanced with more

218
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,160
inexpensive cameras and motion sensor

219
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,480
like soil water and air quality quality

220
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
could be continuously measured for leaks

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
or emission in similar way with the

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
addition of internet capability

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
real-time situational information can be

224
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
related to command and support

225
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,959
facilities remotely from the battle bill

226
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,640
but if enemy takes advantage of

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
vulnerabilities in such devices or

228
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
networking or compromised devices it may

229
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,279
allow the enemy to provide false

230
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
information to the warfighters and the

231
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
supporting remote organization so

232
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
clearly it's important to prioritize

233
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
addressing the highest risk

234
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
vulnerabilities already installed in

235
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
mission system such as ensuring that the

236
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
information is encrypted where needed

237
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
implement policies and uh processes to

238
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
ensure supply chain risk management of a

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,640
broader array of potential devices that

240
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
could be deployed with our

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,839
troops

242
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
another case scenario can be of

243
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
battlefield situational awareness so

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
very small size and low cost of sensing

245
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,000
and communication devices makes them

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
ideal for deploying in low power network

247
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
in forward situation to provide

248
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,560
warfighter with enhanced situational

249
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,200
awareness now the trade can be imagined

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
that the enemy takes advantage of these

251
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,800
vulnerabilities in the devices or

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,680
networking hacking into or compromise so

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
they can easily get information like

254
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
what are the uh what's going on the

255
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
other side of the battlefield

256
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
now

257
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
let's understand what is rf so rf

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
signals are a form of electromagnetic

259
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
wave such as visible light which makes

260
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,720
up a portion of the electromagnetic

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
spectrum this emi spectrum encompasses

262
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
all forms of light which ranges from

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
audible frequencies such as the upp 2s

264
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,480
60hz through the standard radio band

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
which include am radio fm radio tv

266
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
channels and other rf bands so the

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
spectrum continues through infrared

268
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,240
visible and ultraviolet light light to

269
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
higher form of em energies like x-ray

270
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,600
gamma ray and cosmic ray so red radio

271
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,760
frequency can be a complex subject to a

272
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
navigate but it does not have to be

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
if you are just getting started with

274
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
radio or maybe you cannot find that old

275
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,560
reference book about antenna aperture

276
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
this session will help you it is

277
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,920
intended to provide you basic

278
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,160
understanding of rf technology and what

279
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
are the future traits which we need to

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
address

281
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
so

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
let's see some uh

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
what basically lights inside the radio

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
wave spectrum the following frequency

285
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
allocation chart here shows various

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
commercially used devices with their

287
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,040
application and frequency based on the

288
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
ntia and fcc here you can see fm radio

289
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
operating on 100 megahertz the gps and

290
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
cell phone somewhat near to 900

291
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,959
megahertz while adsb signal on frequency

292
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
1090 megahertz which can directly

293
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
capture from uh rtl devices and 2.4

294
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
gigahertz bandwidth which is used by

295
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,040
more than 300 consumer devices including

296
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,959
microwave oven portless phone and

297
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,040
wireless network uh like wi-fi and

298
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,680
bluetooth so invisible and ignored our

299
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
devices are currently

300
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,880
screaming out large amount of

301
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
information about us our habit our

302
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,519
pattern of life to anyone who care to

303
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
listen so let's see some example of what

304
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,600
is formally being broadcasted and what

305
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,920
can be done with this information so i

306
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
think like we already know this kind of

307
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,160
vertex so i will uh quickly move forward

308
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
through it and uh i will discuss about

309
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,040
the

310
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,360
from the difference perspective more so

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
uh basically we think about the uh

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
signals in two domain time domain in

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
frequency domain time domain when

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,279
dealing with the world of radio

315
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,279
frequency communication often there are

316
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
two families of instrumentation used for

317
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,279
measuring radio operation and

318
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
performance the first family is

319
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,800
represented by the time domain

320
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
measurement such as the amplitude of a

321
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,519
signal over a given time typically which

322
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,920
is measured with an oscilloscope

323
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
this instrument also include basic

324
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
digital meters power supplies and other

325
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
related equipment time domain

326
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
instruments are usually utilized when

327
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
analyzing basement performance power

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
supply or operation current draw etc

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
meanwhile frequency domain which is a

330
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
synthesis majority of the rf

331
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
communication performance parameter

332
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,519
regulations and design constraints are

333
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,120
measured in the world of frequency

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,440
domain measurement usually take the form

335
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,079
of power versus frequency so typically

336
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
measured with a spectrum analyzer

337
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
instruments also include signal

338
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
generator which is used to produce

339
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
carriers and data modulated signal as

340
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
well as network analyzer

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
so uh you can like using the rf

342
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
frequencies uh rtl devices hdr like rf

343
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,760
uh blade rf we can implant simply

344
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,040
implement our own live rf broadcast

345
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
then we can

346
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,000
put the gps frequency and we can

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,079
transmit the gps signal to spoof the

348
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,639
locations so we can like simply do it

349
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,440
using the gps hdr sim libraries

350
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
we can also uh

351
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
make our own virtual radar using the rl

352
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
1090 or

353
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,920
integrate with uh rtl uh sorry virtual

354
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
radar to track adsb signals

355
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,920
other thing is using grcsm to capture

356
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,480
the mc mc of any mobile number so if we

357
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
like get the uh kc number we can even

358
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
decrypt the sms in relation to call cell

359
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
phones so mc capture is again one of the

360
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,079
rf attack

361
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
another attack is like a replay attack

362
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
which can be implemented

363
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,279
against the car

364
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,079
another is like you can uh

365
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,720
record the signals in replay so you can

366
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,880
head into the smart lights

367
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,760
so we all know like wi-fi uses radio to

368
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
communicate but so do the other 99 plus

369
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
protocol that make up the world of

370
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
mobile cellular and the internet of

371
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,920
things i have not discussed those slides

372
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
up before uh in a practical way because

373
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,959
we have already did the presentation on

374
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
uh those things so uh i will be

375
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,959
discussing about from the defense

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
perspective so all these new radio

377
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
enabled devices bring with them new

378
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
invisible trade

379
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,639
enterprises will need to be able to

380
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
react to new trades entering their

381
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,079
environment through the internet of

382
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
radio so some of the basic attacks can

383
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
be rap attacks can be sniffing board

384
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
driving able to attack replay attack uh

385
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
firmware update exploitation jamming uh

386
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
physical layer protocol abuse or make

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,560
layer channel reservation abuse so we

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,279
often hear about the danger of dark web

389
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,839
but the internet of radio is not merely

390
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
dark it's invisible so any wireless

391
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,399
network is going to have a few security

392
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,120
risks so it is important to address them

393
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
now the first issue is that the fact

394
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
that the sensors are broadcasting all

395
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
the information they have continuously

396
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,279
an adversary listening into the network

397
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,560
could easily

398
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,320
see all the information which is being

399
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
broadcasted or even boards fabricate

400
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
their own data to confuse the clustering

401
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,040
algorithms the other issue is that an

402
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
adversary listening to the network could

403
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
attempt to flood the network with

404
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,639
packets to prevent the sensors from

405
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
transmitting their data like those old

406
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
ddos attack

407
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
so in a press conference in 2016 nato

408
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,040
allied ministers formally agreed to

409
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
include cyber operation in its world

410
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
domain along with the air land and sea

411
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,399
operation and to amplify the defense of

412
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,959
its computer network so declaring cyber

413
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,519
as an official domain of warfare allows

414
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
nato to improve planning and better

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,360
manage resources for cyber defense

416
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,399
operation

417
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,959
so what does it mean is like

418
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,000
nato can now answer to any cyber attacks

419
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,639
or any kind of attack with the air land

420
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
or sea attack so if there's any

421
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,639
conventional cyber attack they can

422
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
answer with weapons as well now the

423
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,680
military face of new reality one with

424
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,320
multi-domain challenges the way military

425
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
built its forces integrate its planning

426
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
and synchronize its operation must

427
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,040
change quickly so in modern military

428
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
lingo there are five interrelated domain

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
land maritime air space and cyber space

430
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
now the cyber space domain is wholly

431
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
man-made and is ever changing so in the

432
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,279
emerging multi-domain reality an attack

433
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
will come from multiple domains

434
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
simultaneously dreaming of radio and

435
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
data link persistent surveillance and

436
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
precise long range fire so military

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
needs to instill to its commander the

438
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
ability to deal an ambiguity in

439
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,399
incomplete information

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,360
the folk of the war in digital age so

441
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
yet continue to operate in a manner

442
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
consistent with the intent

443
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,919
now so there's a famous cure from the

444
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,799
book art of war by sun tzu

445
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,720
there are not more than five musical

446
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,799
notes yet the combination of these five

447
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,119
gives rise to a more melodies that can

448
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,599
ever be heard there are not more than

449
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
five primary colors yet in combination

450
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,720
they produce more hues then can ever

451
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,160
ever be seen

452
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
there are not more than five cardinal

453
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
taste yet combination of them yield more

454
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,440
flavors then can ever be tested so now

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,520
we can imagine about the results from

456
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,919
convergence of ground airborne naval

457
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,080
space and cyber

458
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,880
so

459
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
as we examine history it becomes almost

460
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
incredible that we would

461
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
not have anticipated our great social

462
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
media platforms to be infiltrated and

463
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,039
weaponized against us so here we will be

464
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,200
seeing like some of the basic uh few uh

465
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,280
history of electronic warfare so

466
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
electronic warfare has come a long way

467
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,120
from the early days of basic signal

468
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
intelligence and has conveyed a wide

469
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
variety of technology and use cases like

470
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
starting from the russo japanese war in

471
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,440
1904

472
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,320
1904 where the birth of signal which is

473
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,080
also told as the birth of signal

474
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
intelligence so japan ability to

475
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,640
intercept and analyze russian naval

476
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
transmission played a significant role

477
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,919
in the eventual japanese victory then uh

478
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,320
moving forward like it was used by the

479
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,679
uk as well

480
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,000
in 1940 like the battle of britain are

481
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,480
tuning the tide with radar so using a

482
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
new breakthrough in radio transmitter

483
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
the resonant kvt magneton and detector

484
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,120
arrange the range at different heights

485
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
and angles to pick up the reflected

486
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
radio waves bouncing of enemy aircraft

487
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
raf fighters could be quickly intercept

488
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,919
uh directed to internship again uh in

489
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
like a cuban missile crisis in 1962 uh

490
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
they dis for the deceptive drones they

491
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
have used the uh ew the electronic

492
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
warfare so equipped with an early form

493
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
of electronic deception drones narrowly

494
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
missed featuring in one of the cold war

495
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
hotest moment the plane was uh the plan

496
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,799
was for unmanned rihanna model 147 which

497
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,720
is fitted with the receivers for cubase

498
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
soviet uh built surfaces to air missile

499
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,160
and to overfly the island so uh even

500
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,039
like uh this was used for in the uh

501
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,600
vietnam war some of the other attack was

502
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
like in a battle of latin india where

503
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,559
electronic warfare even goes to the sea

504
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
and the stuxnet uh gulf war where the

505
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,240
gps at war so while targeting uh and

506
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,039
tracking uh smart uh smart missile

507
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,880
guidance the gulfport highlight

508
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,200
highlighted the suspectibility of gps to

509
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
jamming with even some relatively

510
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,919
unsophisticated devices providing

511
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,000
capable of masking the weak signal from

512
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,400
the system's capability so gps still

513
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,919
remains vulnerable to jamming and

514
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,640
spoofing today now let's see like what

515
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
happens in the future like in the

516
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,880
quantum super power because like quantum

517
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,559
technology technology could be game

518
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,200
changer across the globe then along for

519
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,679
the world of ew application so as we

520
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,039
currently know them

521
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,720
quantum communication systems are

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,440
inherently secure quantum radar can see

523
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,159
through stills quantum metrology offers

524
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,559
an unjamable uh navigation and quantum

525
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
cryptography promises an unbreakable

526
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,280
uncrackable quotes so the fight to

527
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,360
master quantum technology could render

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
its adversary ew systems redundant

529
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,240
overnight and china clearly wants to win

530
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
that race

531
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,559
so uh

532
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,400
modern military forces are required to

533
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
operate in an increasingly complex

534
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
electronic uh

535
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
electromagnetic environment which has

536
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
recently been or recognized as an

537
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
operational environment so all modern

538
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
forces conduct operation that depend on

539
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
the use of eme the recognized use for

540
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
the military forces to have access to

541
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,039
and utilize the eme creates

542
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,240
vulnerabilities and opposed needs for em

543
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
spectrum warriors so therefore a new

544
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
operational discipline has been set up

545
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
accordingly named electromagnetic

546
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
electromagnetic spectrum operation or

547
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
emso

548
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
here you can see like ems consists of

549
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,640
not only traditional electronic warfare

550
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
but includes several other discipline

551
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,240
which operate in electromagnetic

552
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
environment such as signal intelligence

553
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
as part of information operation

554
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
spectrum management and cyber

555
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,799
electromagnetic activities electronic

556
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
warfare remains the most main combat

557
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
discipline of em ratio the other thing

558
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,480
is

559
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
signal

560
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,679
is included in the wider framework of

561
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
information operation and refers to the

562
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
ability to exploit signal data and

563
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
information did rely on the use of

564
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
electromagnetic spectrum as a physical

565
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,120
layer so aw techniques use

566
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
electromagnetic energy on a targeted

567
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
frequency effectively dominating the

568
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,240
insurgent's ability to understand sense

569
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,039
hear or communicate so aw technology can

570
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
also address remote control uh

571
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
improvised exploitative devices where

572
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,039
sophisticated electronic counter

573
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
measures jam the control signal and

574
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,520
prevent detonation by telephone radio

575
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,919
control toys or other radio jamming

576
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
emitters

577
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,559
so

578
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,159
electronic warfare is divided in three

579
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,000
domains which is electronic attack

580
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,679
electronic protection and electronic

581
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,760
support here electronic

582
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
warfare it comes like military

583
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,600
operations are executed in an

584
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,679
information environment which is

585
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
increasingly complicated by the

586
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
electromagnetic spectrum now it is also

587
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,799
called like esm ecm eccm

588
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,320
which means like electronic support

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
measures electronic counter measures in

590
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
electronic counter counter measures so

591
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,919
elements of

592
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,919
command and control warfare or for the

593
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,000
military deception for the physical

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,320
deception we use this kind of takes

595
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
now electronic attack involves the

596
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,159
offensive use of

597
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
em energy directed energy or

598
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
anti-radiation weapons to attack

599
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
personal facilities or equipment with

600
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
the intent of degrading so some of the

601
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,799
things which comes under electronic

602
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,880
attacks can be electronic intelligence

603
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
like uh foreign known communication

604
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
electromagnetic information uh comment

605
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,280
can be a communication intelligence

606
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,919
which works like to identify if there's

607
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,120
any uh foreign communication

608
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
transmission which is intercepted by

609
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
other than the intended uh recipients

610
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
then uh some of the like advantages can

611
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
be uh for the personal facilities and

612
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
equipment we use active and passive

613
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
energy to attack and uh four classes of

614
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
ea can be classified as jamming modifier

615
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
uh radio absorbing materials then

616
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
physical destructions while in

617
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
non-destruction ea it comes like a

618
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,760
jamming noise sport bearish sweep chaff

619
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
plates so these are all like

620
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,959
non-destructive electronic attack

621
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
now electronic protection which involves

622
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
like action taken to protect friendly

623
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
forces like personal facilities or

624
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,559
equipment for any effects of friendly or

625
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
enemy use of electromagnetic spectrum

626
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
that degrade neutralize or destroy

627
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
friendly combat capability so here we

628
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,240
can see uh ultimate trainer successfully

629
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,400
used cyber weapons in electronic warfare

630
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
technology to throat a simulated tank

631
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,440
assured a training exercise conducted at

632
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,919
the army national training center at 4th

633
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,240
airing so the exercise reinforced the

634
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,640
need for the ew and cyber protection

635
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,120
technology that is under development by

636
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
entities such as repeat uh army rapid

637
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,480
capabilities office so this tank had to

638
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
stop this mount and get out of their

639
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,440
protection reduce their mobility so

640
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,760
exercise like this one help determine

641
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,240
the technology and equipment which is

642
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
necessary to achieve this effect in the

643
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
field if we don't win the cyber and

644
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
electronic warfare fight then the next

645
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,360
manual may not matter because we may not

646
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
get to it

647
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,679
so while interference generally describe

648
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,080
an intentional form of a disruption

649
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
during wireless communication jaming

650
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
described the deliberately interference

651
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
with the blocking of such communication

652
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,159
so as the name suggests jamming antennas

653
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,400
are especially used to interfere with

654
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
the radio noise or signal so in

655
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,640
electronic warfare these interference

656
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
are mean to disrupt control of a battle

657
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,679
for example jammer radial

658
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
interfering signal toward an opponent

659
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
radar blocking the receiver with high

660
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
concentrated energy signals so the two

661
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,000
main gaming techniques are noise

662
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
technique and repeater technique sport

663
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
gaming suite for jamming better jamming

664
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,320
are three most common types of noise

665
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,360
gaming whereas dr fm gaming is the most

666
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,520
common type of free repeater gaming so

667
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
in sport gaming like we do the kind of

668
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,640
noise gaming where jammer focuses on all

669
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
of its power on a single frequency

670
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,640
rendering the technique ineffective

671
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,960
against a frequency agile radar so

672
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,679
sweeping free jamming is the process of

673
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
shifting a jammer full power from one

674
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
frequency to another so this sweeping

675
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,279
motion james multiple frequency in quick

676
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
succession all through not all at the

677
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
same time while meanwhile beret jamming

678
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,640
is the jamming of multiple frequency at

679
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,880
once by a single jammer so the main

680
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
drawback of this technique is that the

681
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
jammer spreads its power power across

682
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
multiple frequency making it

683
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,679
comparatively less powerful at a simple

684
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,919
frequency a single frequency so now the

685
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,159
question is uh how can we secure

686
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,679
ourselves and how do we communicate

687
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,279
while someone is like doing a gaming

688
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,679
attack on us so wireless digital uh

689
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,000
wireless digital communication system

690
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
generally employ radio frequency signal

691
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
to transmit information so transmitter

692
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
needs to convert digital signal uh

693
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
messages which is represented in bits to

694
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,440
ra signal while receiver convert this

695
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
received rf signal back to digital

696
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
messages

697
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,320
now on the transmitter side upon

698
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,400
receiving bits from upper layer the

699
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,480
transmitter first modulates them to

700
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
discrete basement signals then converts

701
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
them into analog signal using a digital

702
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
to analog converter and finally out

703
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,080
convert them to rf signal so these rf

704
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
signals go through the wireless channel

705
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
and reach the receiver upon receiving

706
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,080
the rf signal the receiver perform the

707
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,320
inverse processing it down converts in

708
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
simple the received signal to receive

709
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
basement signal and then demodulate them

710
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
to bid so in alive friendly gaming upon

711
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
detecting a transmission the authorized

712
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
device can employ proper signal

713
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
processing techniques to remove the

714
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
jamming signal from the received mixed

715
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
signal so in contrast the unauthorized

716
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
device does not have the secret key and

717
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
cannot remove the interference which is

718
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,520
introduced by a light gemini signals now

719
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
in figure 2 uh you can see

720
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,320
for which further illustrate like alive

721
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,399
friendly jamming where one ally is

722
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
presented for simplicity so assuming the

723
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
ally jammer the unauthorized and

724
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,360
unauthorized devices all are in the same

725
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
area so as mentioned earlier the ally

726
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,880
jammer in authorized gamer including a1

727
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,840
a2 and aj in figure which say a secret

728
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
key ka the ally jammer aj which uses a

729
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
serial random number generator with k as

730
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,919
the seed to continuously emulate jamming

731
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,559
signal x of j so when the unauthorized

732
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,840
device even transmits signal to x of e1

733
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
to another unauthorized device a3 the

734
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
signal received by a3 will be the

735
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,640
mixture of both x of even and some

736
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,279
portion of x of j with enough jamming

737
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,240
power the jamming signal from a of j can

738
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,120
effectively distort the signal x of e1

739
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
at e3 so as a result the wireless

740
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,880
communication between unauthorized

741
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
device even in e3 is disabled when a1

742
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
transmits signal x of a1 to a2 the

743
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,600
jamming signal x of j will also distort

744
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,440
the received signal at a2 so however now

745
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,919
this like to remove x of j from the mix

746
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,919
signal authorized devices need to

747
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,320
synchronize with the aligning signal

748
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
estimate their values in the mixed

749
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
signals and remove them from the

750
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,760
received mixed signal to recover

751
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,919
meaningful transmission so this is how

752
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,159
like we exactly communicate between uh

753
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,480
when there's some kind of uh jamming

754
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
attacks which is being performed so in

755
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,799
real time scenario um

756
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,399
after the designation like which is

757
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,360
received by external rwr that analyzes

758
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,799
the victim radar signal for key

759
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
parameter the jammer performs the actual

760
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
following actions that generate ecm

761
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
signal which is intentionally by

762
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
independent oscillators such as vco

763
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,440
so uh here you can see the ea 18-g

764
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,840
grower which uses a powerful electronic

765
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,159
attack gmail to blind enemy radar and

766
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,880
protect allied aircraft during missions

767
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,480
into hostile territory

768
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
so unfortunately the very high energy

769
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,120
from the gmr also blocks onboard

770
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
communication so intense like uh

771
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,039
collects the sample of the jammer

772
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,600
interference and usage state simple to

773
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,840
create an inter

774
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,159
signal which it then uh

775
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,000
mixes into the receive path for the

776
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,640
protected radio the result of mixing the

777
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,799
interference and anti-interference is

778
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,200
dead they cancel each other out leaving

779
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,440
only the desired reception so this is

780
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,279
the real time scenario like where this

781
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,000
uh

782
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,760
signals is being used

783
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,080
now we can see uh radar performance and

784
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,200
frequency bone so now radar is like most

785
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,520
most probably the there are few factors

786
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
which affect the radar performance some

787
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,320
of them is radar power frequency change

788
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
oil slate the kind of antenna we are

789
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
using and the scan pattern so escalator

790
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
which means like influence of amount of

791
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,600
energy which is directed towards the

792
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
target radar

793
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
again like the propagation will depends

794
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
the kind of receiver we have the kind of

795
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
transmitter we have so these are some of

796
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
the factors on which uh our parameter uh

797
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,080
the received power will depend so let's

798
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
for an example if we are transmitting in

799
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,399
100 kilo volt of power

800
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,360
uh from the transmitter so after like uh

801
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,200
let's say if it's on a distance of 10

802
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,760
kilometer we will only receive the power

803
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
in pico watts so rest all of this like

804
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
going in the reflection uh propagation

805
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,480
the environment factor and everything

806
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,799
so here in this image uh you can see

807
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,039
some of the rcs for the uh

808
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,440
major uh war fighters

809
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
so radar cross section is like a measure

810
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
of how detectable an object is by the

811
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,519
radar so therefore it is called

812
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,919
electromagnetic signature of the object

813
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
now a larger rcs indicates that an

814
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,279
object is more easily detectable an

815
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,120
object reflects a limited amount of

816
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,279
radar energy back to the source the

817
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,440
factor that influence this include the

818
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,320
material of the target which is made the

819
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,080
size of the target relative to the

820
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,919
wavelength of the illuminating radar

821
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,720
signal the absolute size of the target

822
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
the incident angle the polarization of

823
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,320
the transmitted and received radiation

824
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,039
so while important in detecting target

825
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,120
the strength of the emitter and distance

826
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,640
of node factor that affect the

827
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,519
calculation of an rcs because rcs is a

828
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,159
property of target reflectivity so here

829
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,640
we can see like the example of b2 spirit

830
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
f22 or raptor

831
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,159
f45 lightning so while no aircraft is

832
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,559
totally invisible to radar still

833
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,640
aircraft make it more difficult for

834
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,720
conventional radar to detect or track

835
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,399
the aircraft effectively

836
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,799
so in addition to reducing the infrared

837
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,519
and acoustic emissions a stealth vehicle

838
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,159
must avoid radiating uh any other

839
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,799
detectable energy such as from onboard

840
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,360
radar communication system or rf leakage

841
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,879
from electronic enclosure

842
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,760
now modern military forces rely heavily

843
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,000
on a variety of complex high technology

844
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
electronic offensive and defensive

845
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
capability so traditionally cyber and

846
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,000
electronic warfare were distinct

847
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,880
entities but now cyber warfare involves

848
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,600
action by a nation state or intense

849
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,919
international organization to attack an

850
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,600
attempt to damage another nation's

851
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,240
computer or information network through

852
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,559
so for example computer virus or a

853
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
denial of service attack the military

854
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,960
has already designated cyber space as

855
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,279
the fifth domain of war so along with

856
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,600
four physical domains like air land and

857
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
space

858
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,320
in its milling making the

859
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,919
electromagnetic effect on the sixth

860
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,159
domain so the cyber space operations are

861
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
the employment of cyber space

862
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
capabilities so here you can see ew has

863
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
been a sleeping beauty hidden away in

864
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
foreclosing for a generation

865
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,600
now it is a dragon about to be

866
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,760
re-awakened and natto leaders who

867
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,000
continue to ignore its significance to

868
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,720
do so at the aerial alliance peril

869
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,039
so here you can see like what exactly it

870
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,919
looks like like how all of these five

871
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,080
domains are integrated what is it going

872
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,039
in the radio domain

873
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
so in convergence of electronic warfare

874
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
in computer network exploitation attack

875
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,240
within the radio frequency spectrum it

876
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
describes how the integration of ip

877
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,720
capabilities sense system using radio

878
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,399
frequency for communication provide

879
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,120
attacker the ability to exploit systems

880
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,679
on isolated network so unlike current

881
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
cyber and electronic warfare protection

882
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,120
teams which are focused on

883
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,960
vulnerabilities within their respective

884
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,279
areas adversaries which are focused on

885
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,919
achieving desired effect and end estate

886
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,799
goals this trait is highlighted by

887
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,720
oversight in software and communication

888
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
systems which developers in recognizing

889
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,279
like vulnerabilities which is introduced

890
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,279
during the integration of hardware and

891
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,760
software so digital technology have

892
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,079
transformed warfare beginning with the

893
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,079
emergence of network centering operation

894
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,960
in the 1990s digital technologies have

895
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
become the basic of weapons tactics and

896
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,320
strategy so today warfighter use

897
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
connected devices to coordinate air

898
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,639
strikes on the battlefield drones are

899
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
controlled from thousands of miles away

900
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,879
commander watch real-time video of

901
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,800
streaming video of the better space and

902
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
logistics and the border supply chain

903
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,800
which are regulated and managed by

904
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,040
complex digitally technologies so the

905
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,119
next generation of emerging technologies

906
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,119
such as like artificial intelligence

907
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,239
smart drone robot additive manufacturing

908
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,000
will make the military even more

909
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
dependent on digital technologies

910
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,960
so here we can see a quick difference

911
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,040
between kinetic weapons and cyber

912
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,720
weapons so kinetic weapons almost always

913
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,599
produce in irreversible physical effect

914
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,359
whereas cyber weapons can produce

915
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,599
completely reversible effect so all

916
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,599
through a small fraction of weapons for

917
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,240
example rubber bullet can deliver quick

918
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,119
recall

919
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,520
quickly recoverable outcome most are

920
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
intended to produce permanent or slow

921
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,320
recovery effect while cyber weapons can

922
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
produce permanent damage to the physical

923
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,720
world such as in the case of istek net

924
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
which caused physical destruction of

925
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
centrifuge other cyber effect can be

926
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
completely reversed by either the

927
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,400
attacker or the victim

928
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,040
for example when a denial of service

929
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,520
attack stops the target systems are

930
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
returned to normal encryption such as in

931
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
uh used in ransomware is also reversible

932
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,359
given the correct decryption key so

933
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,040
indeed ransomware relies on

934
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,520
reversibility in order to be effective

935
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,680
demonstration of the capability to deny

936
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,640
access and subject belief that it can be

937
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,960
undone or the predimed or to the victim

938
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,160
willingness to pay ransom importantly

939
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,320
reversibility can be an asset of or

940
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,560
limitations of cyber weapons depending

941
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,960
on the objective of their use so it is

942
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
difficult to reverse engineer and reuse

943
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,599
kinetic weapon since they are typically

944
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,640
damaged

945
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,440
beyond every use of a condition of their

946
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,839
employment so because cyber weapons are

947
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,560
often compromised of easily replicable

948
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,839
software they offer more ability for

949
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,800
others to abuse analyze reuse of the

950
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,119
weapons by simply copying the software

951
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,960
and replying the construct of its

952
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,160
employment

953
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
whether separately or combined cyber and

954
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
kinetic weapons are now available as

955
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,440
strategic instruments of power then

956
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
present noble opportunities for pursuing

957
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,320
national objectives so given the short

958
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
history of cyber warfare many

959
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,280
opportunities remain to uh for future

960
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,040
work to deepen the understanding of

961
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,079
cyber weapon as leading game experience

962
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,720
and expertise with cyber weapon it can

963
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,800
be integrated with combat and gray zone

964
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,160
options will be strengthened

965
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
so here you can see like a command and

966
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
control why it is most important so one

967
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,520
might consider like c3i is the brain of

968
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,160
modern warfare so if c3i systems are

969
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,320
considered the brain then battlefield

970
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
sensors are actuators the internet of

971
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
battlefield things are the key and

972
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,280
here's an uh military manual the hands

973
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
and the feet so it is the preserveness

974
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,680
of iot devices that will essentially

975
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,280
makes the eyes ear hands and fit in

976
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
inseparable from the brain

977
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,200
so we often think like command and

978
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,280
control is a distinct and space light

979
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,800
functions like the logistics

980
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
intelligence electronic warfare or

981
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
administration with its own peculiar

982
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
methods vocabulary and occurring

983
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
independently of other functions but in

984
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,839
fact command and control encompasses all

985
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,079
military functions and operation giving

986
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
them meaning and harmonizing them into a

987
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,079
meaningful whole

988
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,640
so done well command and control h to

989
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,359
our strength done poorly it invites

990
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,240
disaster so even against a weaker army

991
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,320
now command and control help commander

992
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
make the most of what they have for

993
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,359
people information material then often

994
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
most of all the time so here you can see

995
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
uh now it's time for cable to get

996
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,720
serious about the cyber reconnaissance

997
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
the whole art of war consists of

998
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,640
understanding what is on the other side

999
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,359
of the hill so in this new world much of

1000
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,599
the information essential to effective

1001
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,160
technical decision making may appear in

1002
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,560
cyber space long before it is extracted

1003
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,320
through the dangerous and pain staking

1004
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
process of air and ground reconnaissance

1005
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,359
so such an information important shift

1006
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,520
requires a reframing of our traditional

1007
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
approach to reconnaissance

1008
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,400
it is is it now necessary to expand the

1009
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
concept of military reconnaissance to

1010
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
include the cyber domain if so how

1011
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,119
should such a capability be organized in

1012
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,440
the military who should do it and what

1013
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
are the hazards with such an approach so

1014
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,040
there are many cases studies like uh

1015
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,480
we can like use the crowdsource

1016
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,079
surveillance and the future of internet

1017
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,720
so let's say uh for example if by 2030

1018
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,760
more than 125 billion computers sensors

1019
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,240
and iot devices will be connected to the

1020
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
worldwide web roughly 15 for every

1021
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,440
person's ally so by that time nearly 80

1022
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,760
percent of the data which is moving on

1023
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
broadband network will be video it is

1024
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
reasonable to assume that these trends

1025
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,079
will combine to create a ubiquitous

1026
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,160
network of cloud source surveillance

1027
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,640
where nearly every event in a public

1028
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,440
space recorded and uploaded on the web

1029
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,200
by private commercial or government

1030
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,079
actors and commercially used owned iot

1031
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,520
devices

1032
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,839
now some of the modern equivalent of the

1033
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,920
world war 3 era warning that

1034
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,760
loose leaves sink ships maybe ffs don't

1035
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,640
share your fitbit data on duty so let's

1036
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
consider the uh this interesting case

1037
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,720
study where the fitness data company

1038
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,440
estrava recently came under fire when it

1039
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,599
was discovered that its global heat map

1040
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
which aggregated millions of geotech

1041
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,880
devices inadequately really reveal the

1042
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040
location and outline of u.s military

1043
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
bases in conflict area so while this

1044
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
incident provide a useful reminder about

1045
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
the importance of operational security

1046
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,720
it reveals a much more valuable message

1047
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,960
about the future of root recurrence as a

1048
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,119
military operation so moving a large

1049
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,359
military force over unfamiliar trade

1050
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,839
terrain presents a formidable challenge

1051
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,680
so as a result a

1052
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,040
reconnaissance formation have

1053
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,680
traditionally needed to reconnect ahead

1054
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,079
of the main body to assess the traffic

1055
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,400
ability of routes like strava modern

1056
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
digital map applications on most

1057
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,119
smartphones uses a process of extracting

1058
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,599
locations from cell tower to determine

1059
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,079
rate of improvement along roadways over

1060
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,480
time this anonymized data provides a

1061
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
useful pattern that can show where

1062
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,640
vehicle traffic is unrestricted

1063
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,119
moderately restricted or impassable it

1064
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,680
can therefore be a powerful tool to

1065
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,240
augment the often dangerous task of

1066
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,160
ground route reconnaissance so in

1067
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,680
addition we are merged with ground

1068
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,400
moving target indicator from aerial

1069
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,160
reconnaissance platform this data can

1070
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,119
also be provide a useful analytical tool

1071
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,119
to distinguish between civilian and

1072
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,200
military vehicle movements so many

1073
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
locations of the military and

1074
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,720
intelligence sng bases

1075
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,480
had already been previously revealed

1076
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
through many other publicly uh sources

1077
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,800
but the bigger worry from an operation

1078
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
security standpoint is how activity data

1079
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
from iot devices could be used to

1080
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,720
identify interesting individuals and

1081
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,480
track them to other sensitive or

1082
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,960
secretive locations

1083
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,839
so history suggests that many of the uh

1084
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,400
most significant advances in military

1085
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
technology begin first is commercial

1086
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
technology so radar for example was

1087
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,400
originally developed as a tool to avoid

1088
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,560
ship collision during limited visibility

1089
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,560
but now it's highly sophisticated for

1090
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,319
defense purpose these emerging

1091
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,240
categories four of cyber tools like

1092
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,960
social media gps-enabled iot devices uh

1093
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,200
satellite imagery database from public

1094
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
repositories like digital globe which

1095
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,560
estimates to restrain a data set of one

1096
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,960
lake tb terabytes are already available

1097
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
in commercial market with adaptation

1098
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,720
might provide a real advantage to

1099
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,880
recondense formation and the biggest

1100
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,560
dangers may come from potential

1101
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,720
adversaries figuring out patterns of

1102
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,520
life

1103
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
so by tracking and even identifying

1104
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,160
military or intelligence uh agency

1105
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,800
personnel as they go about their duties

1106
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,599
or when they come home after deployment

1107
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,839
these digital footprints that echo the

1108
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,240
live real life steps of individual

1109
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,640
underscores a greater challenge each

1110
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
person's connection to online services

1111
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,240
and personal devices make it

1112
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
increasingly difficult to keep secrets

1113
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,920
so too often we think secrets lie hidden

1114
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,480
when they now are mostly open out in the

1115
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,359
open

1116
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,079
most both militaries in the public

1117
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,480
need to be come to greece with the fact

1118
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,319
that the era of secrets is arguably over

1119
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,280
so

1120
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
the focus of the internet of battlefield

1121
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
things is to provide situational

1122
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,119
awareness of the battlefield which is

1123
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,200
utilizing a network of interconnected

1124
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,560
sensors actuators and analytical devices

1125
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,119
so center sensors could detect any

1126
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,280
movement and they rely that information

1127
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
in real time to analyst so enabling them

1128
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
to take technical decisions on

1129
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
positioning areas to avoid or who is

1130
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,560
crossing a certain area this capability

1131
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
would potentially save resources and

1132
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,280
solder's life so making iobt an

1133
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,800
important topic for the defense to

1134
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,359
investigate then of course there's a lot

1135
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,200
of other birds were surrounded by these

1136
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
internet of things in the industrial

1137
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,119
internet of things but the big focus of

1138
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,599
the army is creating another burst term

1139
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,920
adding the b in there so adding the

1140
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
battlefield is a part of this so for me

1141
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,960
it's always been embedded devices we are

1142
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,560
talking about uh

1143
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,280
event security in embedded development

1144
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,760
the big difference of course with all

1145
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,480
these different terms is what you are

1146
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,960
using them for and often times the

1147
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,119
mission and what people are using them

1148
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,839
for don't vary that much but in this

1149
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,160
case we are talking about very extreme

1150
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,800
environment environment that have very

1151
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,680
hostile and downright adversarial

1152
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,640
so note to say that other type of areas

1153
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,880
devices are not being attacked daily

1154
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,119
either locally or across the globe but

1155
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,599
these devices especially will be

1156
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,079
targeted and attacked often to locations

1157
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,240
where they are extremely vulnerable so

1158
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,079
people literally can woke up and do

1159
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,960
whatever they want them to so and of

1160
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,640
course the physical environment often

1161
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,960
times you are putting stuff in the field

1162
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
then you are not ever expecting to get

1163
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,319
it back and you hope that it stays alive

1164
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,040
long enough for you to get use out of it

1165
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,000
and the last thing being dead open these

1166
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,880
devices are not of any use so we are not

1167
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,960
measuring any electric meter it has to

1168
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,680
be able to sit there stay alive then

1169
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,920
have a reasonable assurance that it's

1170
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,480
going to work when we need it and that

1171
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,800
could be days month in some times or

1172
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
years so there are many challenges with

1173
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,000
the internet of devices in battlefield

1174
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,359
so let's see some of them

1175
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
so in the internet of military things

1176
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,280
encompasses a large range of devices

1177
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,880
that possess intelligent physical

1178
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,960
sensing learning and

1179
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,119
actuation capabilities through virtual

1180
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,920
or cyber interferences data integrated

1181
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,319
into system so these devices include

1182
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,839
items such as sensor vehicle robot uav

1183
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,560
human vehicle available devices

1184
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,359
biometric munitions armor weapons and

1185
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,000
other smart technology so the

1186
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,920
vision of a connected battlefield where

1187
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
soldiers interface with the myriad of

1188
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,480
sensor weapon system and support devices

1189
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,079
and adopt the information to gain

1190
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,480
situational awareness as the adversary

1191
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,119
continues to harness the uh choice of

1192
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,680
low cost high adaptative devices for

1193
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,599
developing new attack vector the

1194
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,040
military will be forced to use

1195
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,440
commercial of the cell hardware to avoid

1196
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,319
the rapid option lens and vulnerable in

1197
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,160
which is introduced by custom build

1198
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,560
hardware systems so the key technology

1199
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,359
trends in impacting the iomt theme over

1200
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,800
the next 12 or 24 months includes ai

1201
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,200
sensor processor transmitter health

1202
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,839
monitoring system but above all security

1203
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,000
presents one of the most critical

1204
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,200
obstacles to iot deployment however in

1205
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,839
providing security solutions suppliers

1206
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,079
have had trouble going beyond their

1207
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,839
traditional domain

1208
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,000
so however uh like for example

1209
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,200
operations in iot security offers most

1210
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,000
uh

1211
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,680
mostly been used by device

1212
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
authentication in network reliability so

1213
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,160
clearly bridges can occur at the device

1214
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,400
level network level app level storage

1215
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,520
level or data level

1216
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
now um there are like so many different

1217
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,560
sensors which we use with our uh iot

1218
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,280
devices the center sensor technology is

1219
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,240
evolving fast like eo io sensor radar

1220
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,880
sonar motion sound detector which have

1221
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
like a capabilities augmented is the

1222
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
technology they incorporate improves so

1223
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,960
for example io or ia sensor see further

1224
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,720
but much further climatic and

1225
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,040
atmospheric condition whether it is a

1226
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,800
day or night compared to just a few

1227
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,680
hours uh years ago so fast array radar

1228
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,920
can multitask simultaneously collecting

1229
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,079
intelligence in the land maritime or air

1230
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,480
demand without losing range coverage or

1231
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,520
accuracy so in the same way a microphone

1232
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,839
can be used to pick up potential

1233
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,079
languages that are considerably uh

1234
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,480
considered hostile or friendly so it can

1235
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
identify different type of weapon sound

1236
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
could check the weapon database to match

1237
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,440
potential guns that match a certain

1238
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,119
group of people rfid which can be a

1239
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,040
rudimentary way to confirm that allies

1240
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,520
are passing by because rfid text would

1241
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,000
be assigned to old soldiers camera like

1242
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,240
low quality can be used for discerning

1243
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,480
color patterns of uniform while higher

1244
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,640
quality could be used to take a snapshot

1245
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,680
of object moving in the field of view

1246
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,400
which may consume like store startup we

1247
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,559
need to like send images and there are

1248
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,040
few challenges as well so gps can be

1249
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
used to track locations of sensor

1250
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,520
sensors which is registering events now

1251
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,280
rf which is like to track radio

1252
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,359
frequencies over the area of inter

1253
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,400
interest

1254
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
we can use like infrared or thermal

1255
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
sensors to detect heat signature or

1256
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,319
notify the other sensors to start

1257
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,160
collecting information

1258
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,559
vibration sensors can be used in metal

1259
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,200
fill to detect vibration in stress which

1260
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,839
is experienced by the sensors

1261
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,400
for to identify friend or foe which is

1262
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,160
used by military in conjunction with

1263
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,720
radar to decision friendly and civilian

1264
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,040
vehicles in military units

1265
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,520
then again like magnetor pir sensor

1266
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,920
ultrasonic so there are many view uh

1267
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,000
potential uses of iot sensors in the

1268
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,079
battlefield and some of them are like in

1269
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,839
this image you can see

1270
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:58,240
how they are integrated in the uh

1271
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,640
military like the uniforms so the

1272
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,720
combination of multiple radio wearable

1273
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
likes smart watches and glasses bio

1274
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,680
sensor gpu or gps equipment these are

1275
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,920
all some of the gear arming soldiers

1276
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
with life-saving information and

1277
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,319
creating unprecedented visibility into

1278
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,480
their surrounding so our current and

1279
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,200
future sense soldiers are only as good

1280
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,040
as the communication date said between

1281
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,520
them so the sharing of the information

1282
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,920
wins the fight not the biggest or best

1283
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,160
bullet we are looking at a soldier as a

1284
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,480
communication intelligence platform not

1285
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,119
just a person with a weapon system

1286
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,000
so work work is underway on new

1287
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,559
intelligent body which gear that among

1288
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,720
other things includes onboard computer

1289
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,640
that allows soldiers to cheat online

1290
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,960
during missions and to tie into key

1291
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
defense network to tape into

1292
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,839
intelligence

1293
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,880
so

1294
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,880
as we go down the path of the connected

1295
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,599
soldier the design problem becomes a lot

1296
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,920
more complicated in the design space

1297
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,319
much harder because there are so many

1298
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,720
more ways uh sensors are just like a

1299
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,359
radar or frequency so all of a sudden

1300
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,520
everything is connected and you may uh

1301
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,960
have many floor proliferating systems

1302
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
so uh in this example like you can see

1303
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,640
the drone which is advertised to get

1304
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,800
some awesome paranormic source can be

1305
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,359
used to carry small payloads or grenades

1306
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,520
so this drone comes with a high

1307
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,079
explosive warhead which hangs out in the

1308
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,800
sky until it finds an enemy radar system

1309
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,119
and then fires on it oh and at a

1310
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,599
driverless car you thought was so cool

1311
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,839
here it is in tank from a form at a

1312
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,800
russian arms fair it includes the t-14

1313
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
so one of the big concerns about such

1314
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,839
forms is the issue of autonomy and just

1315
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,839
how much a real control the operator

1316
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,559
have over their action so far there have

1317
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,800
always been a human behind any kill or

1318
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,440
no kill decisions but with more capable

1319
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,040
swarm things may not be so simple so uh

1320
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,760
here you can see like radars is very

1321
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,839
hard to detected by the

1322
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,160
neck eye and more than four lake drones

1323
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,480
are sold each year worldwide which means

1324
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
a potential trait for society in

1325
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,960
critical infrastructure illegal filming

1326
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,200
of a secret object as well as personal

1327
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,520
privacy is very common so the ap

1328
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,680
applicability of drone detection and

1329
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,760
identification methods depends on

1330
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,520
requirement mandated by real life

1331
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,880
scenarios that being said we observe

1332
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,440
that uh methods other than rf sensing

1333
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,839
cannot be solely be reliable to detect

1334
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,640
or identify including drones so on one

1335
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,960
hand radar vision and acoustic beds

1336
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,359
method can be restrained in various ways

1337
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,680
such as using steel technology

1338
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,200
changing the drone physical shape and

1339
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,599
rotor using low noise rotor and by

1340
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,760
emitting natural sound like bird chips

1341
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,040
or white noise in addition search meters

1342
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
x

1343
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,880
require expensive equipment like high

1344
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,119
quality video camera that is not

1345
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
designed to detect drone moreover wi-fi

1346
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,680
based methods are inherently limited as

1347
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,520
they cannot detect drones operated by

1348
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,079
other wireless technologies like 4g and

1349
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,520
they require knowledge of the drone's

1350
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,079
wi-fi parameter as well so on the other

1351
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,720
hand we see that rf sensing based

1352
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,240
methods for drone detection and

1353
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,720
identification are adequate to be used

1354
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,119
in real life scenarios so such methods

1355
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,880
are independent of the wireless

1356
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,880
technology which is utilized by the

1357
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,000
drone like bluetooth 4g or wi-fi and are

1358
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,480
immune to physical alteration on

1359
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,119
differentials among drones so however

1360
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,760
current end methods are not still fully

1361
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,599
automated no robust due to the lake of

1362
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,160
the largely uh labeled database for the

1363
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,599
drone rf signal

1364
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,800
some of the major challenges are like uh

1365
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
if we take an example of airport so we

1366
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,440
have passengers aircraft cargo uh

1367
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,599
parking garages fuse fuel facilities

1368
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,800
airline buildings to uh secure so in

1369
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,119
like in sense of smr which is surface

1370
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,280
movement radar we need to upgrade it

1371
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,200
like we need uh some kind of uh

1372
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,920
upgradation in the asd system so that it

1373
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,160
can detect like the small drones as well

1374
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,559
in the uh proximity of airport there

1375
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,640
have been like many incidents in last

1376
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,720
few months where aircraft drones have

1377
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
attacked the aviation industry

1378
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,760
now the other thing is

1379
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,480
uh improvised expensive devices which is

1380
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,440
iid so many iad devices are using the

1381
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,920
radio frequency for the uh for like the

1382
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,240
controllation and for the command link

1383
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,800
so these ied are inexpensive easy to

1384
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,119
build and acquire and very difficult to

1385
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,800
trace and can be triggered from long

1386
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,280
distances keeping the operator safe from

1387
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,160
any detonation or uh exposure to

1388
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,839
military forces so rcid is simply

1389
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,760
explosive material that is integrated

1390
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,079
with the handheld wireless devices or

1391
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,160
device that will trigger upon reshift of

1392
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,319
a signal from a second wireless handheld

1393
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,359
devices so these rca devices have caused

1394
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,760
many fake fatalities in ngo to forces

1395
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,319
and coalition partner so the solution is

1396
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,839
like

1397
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,440
we need to use the counter ied

1398
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,920
techniques some of the iad technology is

1399
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,920
only limited by the engine unity of the

1400
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,000
person which is manufacturing or

1401
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,119
deploying the devices

1402
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,119
now some of the uh

1403
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,200
okay we are running out of time so i

1404
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,920
will quickly move forward um so the

1405
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,559
moving portray a war in space such as

1406
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,119
the uh they do on earth star fighters

1407
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,319
don't fight with unlimited

1408
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,319
maneuverability and range

1409
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,400
troops trans transcripts like uh from

1410
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,559
orbit to celestial surfaces to deliver

1411
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,040
space marines so how do we think about a

1412
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
space war war fighting on earth

1413
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,520
typically looks uh involves competitors

1414
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,920
fighting to dominate a physical location

1415
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,240
opposing military forces like to fight

1416
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,880
to take control of the land sea and air

1417
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,359
over a certain part of earth to expand

1418
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,000
influence over people or resources so a

1419
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,160
space warfare does not follow this

1420
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,720
periodically satellites in orbit do not

1421
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,040
occupy or dominate a signal location

1422
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,520
over time instead satellite provides

1423
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,359
capabilities such as communication

1424
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,440
navigation and intelligence catering to

1425
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,599
earth based militaries therefore to

1426
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,400
control space is not necessary to

1427
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,960
physically conquer sectors of space but

1428
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,440
rather to reduce or eliminate advisory

1429
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,680
satellite capabilities while ensuring

1430
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,000
one retains the ability to freely

1431
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,799
operate their own space capabilities so

1432
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,200
the weapon used to achieve these goals

1433
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,720
can be either ground based or

1434
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,359
space-based then can be reversible or in

1435
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,920
reversible so the furthermore space

1436
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
weapons type like ranges from kinetic

1437
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,559
weapons much which must physically

1438
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,960
affect a target to a stand of weapon

1439
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,000
which can reach a target many miles away

1440
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,079
so kinetic physical counter space like

1441
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,640
which involves uh directed sn set

1442
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,200
co-orbital asset missiles ground station

1443
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,079
attack

1444
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,000
meanwhile known kinetic attack involves

1445
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,839
electromagnetic pulse attack high

1446
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,559
powered laser and high powered microwave

1447
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,720
so known kinetic weapons are all rf

1448
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,640
based and data like going to be the

1449
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,440
future of a defense so weapons have

1450
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,920
physically effect on satellite or ground

1451
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,400
systems without making physical contact

1452
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
lasers can be used to temporarily dazzle

1453
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,040
or permanently blind the sensors on

1454
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,119
satellite or cause components to

1455
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,160
overheat

1456
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,240
meanwhile like high power uh

1457
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,240
microwave weapons can disrupt satellite

1458
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
electronics or pores permanent damage to

1459
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,599
its electrical circuits

1460
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,359
meanwhile we can also see like in

1461
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,280
counter space weapons we have electronic

1462
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,280
warfare techniques such as like jamming

1463
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,520
and spoofing meanwhile on cyber attack

1464
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,839
we can like perform attacks such as data

1465
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,240
intercept monitoring data corruption or

1466
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,839
seizure of control

1467
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,359
so uh

1468
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,640
we have already discussed about the

1469
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,400
electronic warfare so we know like how

1470
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,720
the jamming and scoping is performed now

1471
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,280
the to understand like how this effect

1472
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
could play in a conflict there are

1473
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,280
couple of key which is important to

1474
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,760
understand so the inter intensity

1475
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,160
dissipator dissipation which is an

1476
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
electromagnetic signal whether radio

1477
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,640
frequency or light is emitted from a

1478
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,799
source the intensity of the signal

1479
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,400
decreases with the square of the

1480
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,720
distance from the source so the further

1481
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,119
away the weaker it is an object 10

1482
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,920
kilometer from a surface will experience

1483
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
only one percent of the intensity of an

1484
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,559
object next to this source so for

1485
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,280
satellites in orbit where distances are

1486
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,359
often measured in hundreds or thousands

1487
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,760
of kilometer a trade would require uh

1488
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,400
need high power level to successfully

1489
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,000
engage with electronic warfare or

1490
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,640
directed energy weapons so signals in a

1491
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,599
vacuum only lose strength due or due to

1492
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,160
a distance however when a signal goes

1493
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,720
through the atmosphere gases such as

1494
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,960
water vapor and oxygen absorb most of

1495
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,400
the intensity

1496
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,240
liquid water also decreased signal

1497
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,119
strength at many frequencies this means

1498
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,920
that a ground to space or a surface to

1499
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,079
ground attack will require more power

1500
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,240
than a space to space attack of the same

1501
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,280
distance

1502
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,119
now precision which is like uh

1503
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,400
electronic warfare

1504
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,559
requires a large degree of precision to

1505
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,520
execute so in this cont context

1506
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,920
precision refers to how well an attacker

1507
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,319
can mess the signal or focus on its

1508
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,559
target so for a jamming attack to be

1509
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,119
successful the attacker must transmit a

1510
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,119
jamming signal that matches the signal

1511
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,359
of the target receiver so even through a

1512
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,480
jamming a large block of signal in hope

1513
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,960
like of hitting the right signal so or

1514
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,880
through simply matching the targeted

1515
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,960
signal now matching a signal is a

1516
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,480
combination of achieving the right

1517
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,400
frequency polarization and signal

1518
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,480
restraint the frequency of the signal

1519
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,720
refers to the number of time the signal

1520
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,640
oscillates through space

1521
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,960
meanwhile swooping attack requires even

1522
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,599
harder greater precision in addition to

1523
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,760
matching the uh signal frequency

1524
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,240
polarization and signal restraint and a

1525
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,359
spoofer

1526
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,440
must also broadcast the right type of

1527
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,760
information on this signal so as an

1528
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,799
example

1529
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,640
suppose an attacker wish to use a

1530
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,200
spoofing technique to transmit false

1531
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,680
troop location to a targeted system so

1532
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,160
for the attack to work the spoofer must

1533
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,799
know what signal to broadcast and give

1534
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,040
data that is close enough to the truth

1535
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,680
so it is unbelievable so the attacking

1536
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,760
spoofer must thoroughly understand both

1537
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,160
the signal itself and how the signal is

1538
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,160
interpreted by the targeted system to be

1539
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,720
effective so the more we can uh

1540
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
intentionalize these insights the better

1541
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,319
we can understand the mistakes of a

1542
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,520
geopolitical uh fights in space

1543
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,960
so for example a one kiloton device uh

1544
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,359
is believed to be strongest if detonated

1545
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,319
at around 25 miles from the earth so if

1546
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,160
detonated much higher the

1547
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,240
electromagnetic pulse would dissipate

1548
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,280
too much if too much detonated uh much

1549
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,839
lower deep inside the earth's atmosphere

1550
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,680
it would not produce an emp of

1551
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,319
consequences at all so like all of the

1552
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,319
electromagnetic all of the electronic

1553
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:50,559
devices which we are using will go off

1554
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,119
so in uh as we are already running out

1555
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,240
of time so where the military has been a

1556
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,319
driver in connected in machine to

1557
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,319
machine communication such as radio

1558
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,799
frequency identification it has been

1559
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,680
slow to adopt through iot application

1560
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,839
that need this communication into

1561
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,079
interpolable automated cycles so

1562
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,720
communication remains within their given

1563
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,839
challenges not easily said or aggregated

1564
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,160
so the challenge is that defense leader

1565
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,400
wishing to take advantage of the iot

1566
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,640
space of complex technological and

1567
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,359
regulatory landscape that threatens to

1568
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,520
mire their efforts in endless choices

1569
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,240
and challenges so the army has done a

1570
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,799
lot of work on system that can work

1571
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,040
without a constant internet connection

1572
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,599
to get around this but because they are

1573
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,599
not linked to the internet they have

1574
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,440
limited limited utility but all of this

1575
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,520
expanded connectivity and technology

1576
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,680
brings a host of risk too

1577
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,839
so for one creating wi-fi enabled

1578
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,480
uniform and weapon could give enemies

1579
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,040
many more digital target if malicious

1580
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,400
hacker can manipulate

1581
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,799
sensors to fake chemical attack those

1582
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,440
false signal can be deliberating so then

1583
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,000
and now it is hard to overstate the

1584
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,079
importance of information to military

1585
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,319
commander everywhere while the rest of

1586
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,319
the world was waking up to the internet

1587
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,280
in 1996 the military for example was

1588
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,359
already outlining plans for information

1589
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,680
superiority so with information so

1590
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,240
central to all activities the military

1591
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,040
is naturally hungry for technology or

1592
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,599
tools that improve communication routing

1593
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,000
or processing of information

1594
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,079
so uh these are all the people's like i

1595
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,760
am really thankful for their research

1596
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,319
their work standards uh

1597
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,040
and academia so you can follow them on

1598
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,960
and read this paper

1599
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,119
oh in conclusion i will say like the

1600
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,359
combined effect of non-federated network

1601
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,760
encoded data on the network or increased

1602
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,400
use of wireless devices and advancement

1603
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,200
in high power jammer will continue to

1604
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
push the rail of cyber electronic

1605
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,000
warfare the growth in these two rule

1606
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,480
links with undoubtedly continue bringing

1607
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,799
challenges to the future warfare that

1608
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,200
will move the center of focus from

1609
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,119
kinetic operation to date of known

1610
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,760
kinetic the trait of overpowering cyber

1611
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
and ew forces will likely generate

1612
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,880
increased funding of known kinetic

1613
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,559
research in a shift in operational

1614
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,960
mentality so could this be the next cold

1615
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,520
war or just the unseen war

1616
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,400
so uh this is all about me uh you if you

1617
