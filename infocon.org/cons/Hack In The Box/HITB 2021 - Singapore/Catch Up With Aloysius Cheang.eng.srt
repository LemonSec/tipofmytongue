not the same bro

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,879
but uh you know what can we do so the

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,480
secret force is all about hanging out

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
together right yeah you spend with each

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
other and and when you first started i

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
think back in 2001 or something it was

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
mainly just because a lot a bunch of us

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
like to do the uh capture deflect right

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
so you rented the place in i think mid

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
valley yeah that's where we started the

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,040
ctf

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
you remember that red it was insane dude

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
what were we thinking we rented like

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
such a huge area and then there was i

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
don't know like four exhibits or

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
something it was ridiculous it was like

88
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,120
social distance you know like in 2008

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
2002.

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,040
we already socialized

91
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,239
back then

92
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
it's like you saw that no everything at

93
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
that point in time is like we are just

94
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,319
uh

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
feeling the ground we have no idea what

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
is coming next and everyone like okay we

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
out and then

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
and that's how it goes right and then

100
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
you guys just grew

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
and grew and grew and grew and then the

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,400

105
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360

behind these cameras over here right as

124

so you you put that rightly in the right

144

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
of the entire community when they come

146
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,440
together then that's when we can address

147

the tv problems that we're facing today

148

and uh it's not that everything is bad

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,199
about you know talking about hacking

151
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,680
talking about a zero day but because you

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,600
need to face this problem you know

153
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,320
directly yeah instead of hiding behind

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
you know walls and pretend that nothing

155
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,880
happened and and that's not not

156
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
something that is

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,919
uh going to happen

158
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,360
when you sleep and you forget the whole

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
you will reset everything right

170
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
it was a bad dream it was a bad dream

171
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
but actually that's that's precisely why

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
when you told me that you're going to

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
become cso at huawei middle east right i

174
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
was very excited because it's actually

175
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
one of the rare occasions somebody who

176
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
is from the community who understands

177
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
the other side you know and it's not

178
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
just that oh hector's bad don't don't

179
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
say heck i mean like who understands

180
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
where the security researchers are

181
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
coming from and that what's the

182
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,880
motivation and and why we do the things

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
we do and it doesn't make it bad you

184
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
know what i mean it's like it was uh

185
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,240
it's refreshing right like we actually

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,280
have a c-level folk who knows

187
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,800
he knows what is what you know what i

188
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,919
mean

189
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
so yeah it was it was good

190
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
i mean you look at that right uh

191
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,639
huawei is almost like microsoft 20 years

192
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
ago right you remember 20 years ago

193
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
right microsoft is like the bane of the

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
cyber security well everybody is talking

195
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
about how bad they are i don't remember

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
all those hack like the uh

197
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,440
uh all the back office or the brook

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,160
repeal kind of thing yeah you know you

199
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
know yeah you guys had uh lsd down and

200
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,319
you have that um the man the man lady i

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
can't remember her near her name for the

202
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,199
blue pill

203
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,919
yeah and then

204
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
then they managed to back up right the

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
industry president is on them and they

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,479
it took them 20

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
years to transform to from from a

208
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
laggard from what you expect

209
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
what you will say that uh is uh somebody

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that is hated by the cyber security

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
community to do a leader to lead the

212
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
the crack down on solar wind since

213
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,120
december so i think huawei is in the

214
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
same situation from a technical

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,039
perspective and it will be that's why i

216
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,960
said it's exciting to join the fight you

217
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
know i mean you don't i don't wake up

218
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,800
and i fight

219
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
myself my whole family to dubai just

220
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
because you know i want to get into a

221
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
position here so i've been there i've

222
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,120
done that but it's more like

223
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,639
getting into the fight the thick of

224
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
things

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
picking up the japanese

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,000
vision yeah i mean the situation

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,919
i mean marked out yesterday gave uh gave

228
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,280
a keynote right and he was talking about

229
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
state of mobile security and stuff and

230
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,479
we were asking him like you know so

231
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
you're talking about ios stuff and you

232
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,319
know ios like got me he's got that so

233
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,680
many protections so we asked him you

234
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
know like who else has been you know at

235
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,520
the forefront of doing defensive and

236
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,720
actually on the mobile right and he

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
named huawei he said rhapsody os you

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
know was like

239
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,960
uh

240
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
no worthy for for the enhancements that

241
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,800
you guys have come up with and in the

242
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,879
face of adversity i mean i i don't think

243
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,240
anybody doesn't know what's going on

244
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
with huawei the us and blah blah blah

245
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
right and what difficulties you guys

246
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,280
have with app store and all these other

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,720
concepts right but

248
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,319
you guys have done like remarkable you

249
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,759
know what i mean to come back from like

250
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
getting quote unquote kicked out right

251
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,360
and then rebuild an app store from

252
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
scratch right rebuild the entire

253
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
developer ecosystem roll it out and grow

254
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,958
it

255
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,599
it's not so subtle so you know

256
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,839
easy

257
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
and and and saying okay fine you know

258
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
these are the limitations we will will

259
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
meet your limitations you know checkmate

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
bro

261
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
uh

262
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
i mean

263
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
you know this this this at the time that

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,440
i call this the cyber wow west right if

265
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
you thought that 20 years ago was a

266
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,200
cyber wow we're starting again i think

267
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
right now is the time in fact if you

268
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
look at it uh world war iii is already

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
amidst us if you if you do really look

270
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
at what's happening right now in the

271
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
cyber space because the entire cyber

272
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,640
space is so fragmented right now

273
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,200
everybody is you against me you know

274
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
everybody have drawn a virtual boundary

275
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
just because of one thing and just like

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,959
what have led to world war one and two

277
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,959
in in the first place it's all about

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
resources the resources are scarce and

279
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,560
everybody is fighting for the same

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,839
resources

281
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
and that's why i say that i mean maybe

282
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
it you don't feel it but actually i

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
would say that right now from in the

284
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
cyber space it's a cyber world war three

285
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,279
and everybody is for themselves and

286
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,079
and and that's where uh you know to be

287
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,000
uh you know born in this era to be here

288
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
to be involved in all this you know

289
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
fight and this is

290
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
where you you love to be you know

291
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,200
as a cyber security professional it's

292
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
almost like one of those

293
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
generals right when you you know for us

294
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
like cyber security guys we like to play

295
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
things like the romance of the three

296
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,120
kingdom kind of thing you will you

297
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
always imagine yourself to be one of

298
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,079
those generals that is leading the fight

299
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,959
now we are leading the fight and and and

300
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,720
make no doubt about it right it is

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
something that is

302
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
uh going to redefine

303
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,200
uh a new water uh industrial cyberspace

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,519
and the new water is all about building

305
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
an open and transparent

306
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
cyber security ecosystem that is not

307
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,959
going to be

308
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,200
influenced by any

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
uh political

310
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
uh or or

311
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
a studio you know

312
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,480
uh

313
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
economic

314
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,000
driven kind of situations that you know

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
people bring in

316
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,959
the nation-states uh uh perspective

317
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,600
interplay i think it will be focusing on

318
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
on the on the building of a nutria

319
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
platform for all the stakeholders to

320
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,320
come together

321
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,560
and that's only when we come together as

322
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,640
a community then we can solve the tv

323
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
problems of cyber security because cyber

324
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
security today is still not you know

325
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,120
people say that it's in the mainstream

326
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
right because people say that because of

327
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
the covet 19 pandemic because of the

328
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,959
digital transformation towards industry

329
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,120
4.0 everybody says that

330
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
the time is now cyber security is in the

331
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,200
forefront of everything we are entering

332
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
the mainstream we are entering the board

333
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
but you look at it

334
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,399
we still are missing the final

335
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,160
step to make that happen right you look

336
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
at the see so of today they are not like

337
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
the gdpr where the dpo is reporting

338
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
directly to the board

339
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,360
the dpo will hire cso to make sure that

340
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
they get all the data protection

341
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,639
controls in place

342
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,320
you as see so report to the dpo

343
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
right so so this is something that we

344
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
have been fighting for all right

345
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
remember that i've been trying to do

346
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
that in singapore and uk it's about

347
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
positioning the cyber security as a

348
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
professional

349
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,680
profession that you know is put in the

350
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,399
same

351
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
breath mentioned in the same breath as

352
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
the medical professions the legal

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,399
professions we are still lacking that

354
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
and and how many times do you find that

355
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
the cso is mentioned in the executive

356
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
management team of any companies today

357
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
how many cso can actually become

358
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
a ceo yeah so much has been done need to

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,079
be done and and that's where your

360
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,120
community is critical right for people

361
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
to understand that it's not all about

362
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
the technical things but how do you

363
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
communicate

364
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,120
okay and link this back to the entire

365
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
ecosystem to the entire story

366
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
that we are building right now that

367
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,760
cyber security

368
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,000
is a critical part of the digital

369
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
transformation today

370
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,760
you're totally right man i mean that's

371
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
exactly why i always say that you know

372
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
the uae has always taken this as a

373
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
proactive step you know what i mean to

374
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
try and get that collaborativeness

375
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
together and get people to kind of like

376
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
bring all the stakeholders the industry

377
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
the legislator

378
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
and the researchers

379
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,959
because you can't fix it you know with

380
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
like only these guys and then with only

381
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,399
these guys right the technical guys are

382
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
talking technical stuff the

383
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,519
c-level guys are talking about budget

384
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
how much money they're gonna need and

385
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
then the legislators are like yeah we

386
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,240
just want to keep people safe and the

387
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
best way possible but it's always you

388
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
know closing the stable door after the

389
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
horse's child already right

390
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
so you know oh when something happens

391
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
come on please solve the problem i mean

392
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,320
let's stop the problem before even the

393
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
problem right

394
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,279
precisely hey can you talk a little bit

395
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
about uh the the work that huawei is

396
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,839
doing and specifically in the uae i mean

397
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
like you know what what have you been

398
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
working on and your team over there

399
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,399
so for for huawei one thing about uh

400
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
what we have been doing consistently not

401
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,120
only with the uae but globally right is

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,760
to be leading initiative

403
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
uh to

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
bring everybody on the same table on

405
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,160
eagle grass so that including the um the

406
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,880
entire ecosystems that we bring to back

407
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,360
right uh to whichever

408
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
uh uh

409
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,120
market that we come in it's all about

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,360
you know making sure that you know we

411
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,160
look at things from a very uh technology

412
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
driven perspective in achieving the

413
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,639
goals

414
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,560
of our customers the

415
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
answer customer

416
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,160
meets their own strategy objectives to

417
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,279
achieve the kind of customer

418
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,079
satisfaction so for us it's all about

419
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,720
making sure that everybody uh within the

420
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
state holding a stakeholder

421
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
ecosystem is happy

422
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,880
so that means that uh if they want to

423
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
look at uh technologies that that they

424
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,279
perceive as key to solving their

425
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
problems are perceived as key

426
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
to

427
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
establishing that digital economy

428
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
we will look forward to see how we could

429
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
uh help them with that right it's all

430
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
about creating this open and transparent

431
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
uh ecosystem so when they say they need

432
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
5g we're bringing 5g when they need

433
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
cloud we're being cloud when they need

434
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,040
ai we've be here and and what we do is

435
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
we don't only bring this in but we we

436
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
will talk with all the customers we will

437
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
also bring the local ecosystem in right

438
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
so we don't we only bring our own

439
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,759
technologies our own partners our own

440
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,600
ecosystem but we try to integrate it

441
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,079
locally and then making sure that it's

442
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,000
adapted to the local

443
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,759
requirement

444
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
our design for uh fit for purpose

445
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,240
and see how we could establish all these

446
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
um so-called you know

447
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,279
systems put them in place and then and

448
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
deliver to them what is necessary for

449
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
uh ingredients to enable the digital

450
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,959
transformation always

451
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,759
security out of the box privacy out of

452
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
the box by design

453
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
right build from scratch using the xero

454
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
truss security mod right we don't talk

455
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,079
about security we don't sell security

456
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:16,959
products

457
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,800
but whatever products we sell to your

458
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
security is enabled by them

459
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
whether is it the 5g or the cloud let's

460
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,240
breakdown make sure that we do that

461
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
what is zero trust in the mobile phone

462
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
like how do you go around there

463
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,480
zero trust in the mobile phone okay your

464
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
trust is actually a security

465
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,440
model right so you can actually apply in

466
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
whatever you know uh

467
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
a so-called technology that you want to

468
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,199
build it's all about designing from

469
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,240
scratch right from the first step right

470
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,959
so

471
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,079
in this case our phone right we we we in

472
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,800
in keyring chipset that we have right

473
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
it's actually a system of chip where

474
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,440
security uh the code and the hardware

475
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
are all embedded into the soc so you are

476
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,359
actually secure by boot

477
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,280
right so that's what we want to build

478
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
before all the sanctions came in

479
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,959
so with the chip you could have a

480
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,720
dedicated uh

481
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,559
core processors that

482
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
that contains the security codes in

483
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
there

484
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
with the chip you can even uh for the

485
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
requirements you can have a dedicated uh

486
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,919
not only the security function but the

487
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
dedicated uh white light that that uh

488
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
delivered the randomized numbers that

489
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
you could use

490
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,039
part of the trusted computing base

491
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
right so in fact we are a member of

492
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
trusted computing uh base uh for for uh

493
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,840
tcb

494
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
for

495
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
for the past like

496
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
15 18 years right so

497
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
so uh when we design we always look for

498
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
the mobile phone um you know secured by

499
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
phone by boot and and then for our new

500
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,600
harmony uh harmony os right we actually

501
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
built it based on if you remember

502
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
symbian

503
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,919
so is is whether you are talking about

504
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
a a macro os or or the uh

505
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
micro os right so so we we we actually

506
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,440
design a micro os that uh we have uh

507
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
uh

508
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
uh

509
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,080
all the components from messaging and

510
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
everything that is separated into a

511
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
smaller module right so we piece them

512
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
together so for our harmony os we

513
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,600
actually have uh have uh put them

514
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
through the most stringent uh cyber

515
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,520
security uh uh we have put the most

516
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,039
strange cyber security tests and put

517
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
them through the most uh stringent cyber

518
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,840
security uh third-party review

519
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
right so for common criteria at this

520
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,840
point in time uh they have i think have

521
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,320
achieved uh

522
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,760
a a full uh certified cc4

523
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,919
certification actually we're pushing for

524
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,799
fun

525
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,000
right so

526
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
so that means that uh from the book to

527
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
the authentication of the user you know

528
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
and everything you know it's supposed to

529
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
be uh the start of uh the endpoint

530
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
security so it's not only for phone

531
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
harmony can be implemented it can be

532
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
deployed in many other things from from

533
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,880
the tab tablets to all the other iot

534
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
devices that will build from our uh uh

535
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,919
if you remember we we have a very

536
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,600
successful product called ideal hub

537
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
which is like

538
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
something that people use for their

539
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
video conferences and all the meeting

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,760
room uh huge huge kind of screen that

541
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
people use for that so everything is

542
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
embedded in there so that our vision is

543
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
that you know all the all the endpoints

544
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,679
when

545
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
from the end point when you pull up to

546
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,919
the point that you connect uh through

547
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,080
our 5g to the cloud

548
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
the entire process okay is is it is a

549
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,960
chaperone with security all the way

550
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
right so the data is secured right from

551
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,400
the endpoint to the cloud and back right

552
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,200
so all this is within our design concept

553
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,000
so

554
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
uh we know that security is only as

555
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
strong as a weakest link so from the end

556
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,600
point okay from the from the endpoint

557
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
where we design our harmony mobile

558
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,799
systems right our hms to

559
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,520
do the 5g um

560
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
network transport layer to our our cloud

561
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
we make sure that the sql controls are

562
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
all in place right so that is take a

563
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,840
tremendous effort to build this

564
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,559
end-to-end uh cyber security

565
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
architecture right you not only have to

566
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
uh educate the rnd guys okay to look

567
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
into the development of this but you

568
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,799
also have to look at you know making

569
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,120
sure that the people that manage the

570
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
code base you know the people to that

571
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,559
manage the entire supply chain

572
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,240
when you bring everything together and

573
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
piece them together to

574
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
to the factories to to the point that

575
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,559
they pack all these things and and put

576
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,960
on the on that lorry and send it to the

577
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
customers right from the warehouse the

578
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
customer or even this kind of security

579
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
security uh

580
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
the the supply chain we have to make

581
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,480
sure that that that we could trace every

582
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,600
single

583
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,480
uh

584
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,080
uh

585
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,799
component every single phase where the

586
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,000
product is

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
so that in the event that if in the

588
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,320
event that we need to

589
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,960
do traceback you know let's say

590
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,720
for some reason something happened when

591
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,880
we need to do immediate trades but it

592
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
can be done

593
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
i mean until the point that we hand over

594
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,480
to the customer once it's hand over the

595
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
customers

596
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,679
then

597
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
not my business

598
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
hey but actually uh for two guys that

599
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
don't know right so huawei is gonna be

600
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
at cyber week in november uh are you

601
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
guys going to bring the harmony os stuff

602
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
over to show off or let people play

603
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,760
around with it or you know what's the

604
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
plan man

605
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,520
i have no uh

606
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,760
plan at the moment to protect you i'm

607
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,159
still planning you guys are in november

608
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,039
yeah before november

609
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
okay bring the harmony stuff like you

610
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
know uh bring bring as much stuff as you

611
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
can bring all the autonomous stuff you

612
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
know bring the ai things we should do a

613
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,559
challenge you know i mean we should do a

614
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,840
harmony like kind of like a

615
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
challenge something could be cool right

616
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,679
like if anybody has some ideas

617
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,320
well you you guys are uh

618
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,760
uh are eyeing on our uh what we call our

619
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,039
autonomous driving yeah

620
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
if you go to the uh you go to ut we'll

621
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
search for

622
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,840
huawei

623
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
car and huawei autonomous driving

624
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,600
vehicle you will see that some of this

625
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
thing has been implemented is with some

626
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
of our partners in china

627
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
uh i think one of the cars have a very

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
cool name called arctic fork walks

629
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,840
arctic fox yeah you can look at it the

630
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,720
design is great and in fact right now is

631
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,679
going under the auto automobile as um

632
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,000
the uh ssae certification for automobile

633
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,640
uh autonomous automobile driving

634
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,360
ecosystems so we're going for uh level

635
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,080
four which means that uh it can totally

636
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,400
fully automate the drive by itself the

637
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
kind of uh at the level of safety so so

638
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
all these things has been done right and

639
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
and and that means that you can even put

640
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,919
it on auto drive within a city driving

641
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,039
kind of

642
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,520
environment right so which is good let's

643
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,039
say in the morning when you go to work

644
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
again if we ever go to work right

645
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,480
and we go to work you know and you feel

646
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
sleepy without

647
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,799
the hi tv coffee bean week i couldn't

648
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
get myself up you know that kind of

649
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
thing then you just press the

650
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,559
the the

651
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,159
the destination you would drive back

652
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,760
right and it will park itself and then

653
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
the next thing is you go to office for

654
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
office with your coffee and talking

655
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,240
about bounty right for huawei we offer

656
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,559
uh i think if not we what we actually

657
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,840
offer the worst

658
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,640
uh

659
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,320
um one of the largest bug body uh reward

660
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,200
right for for anyone to identify a bar

661
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
in our our

662
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
systems whether is it in the cloud or on

663
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
the phone

664
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,039
if i'm not wrong i think it's a

665
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,880
microsoft and google they're offering

666
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,799
about 200 grand right 200 000 usd right

667
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
so for us we normally would do want to

668
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
do one up better than that so we add

669
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
another fifty thousand ah

670
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,840
i thought you're going to say add

671
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,340
another zero

672
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,279
[Laughter]

673
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,000
that would be like calculated

674
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,480
you you find two holes that can get you

675
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,960
500 grand it's pretty good for the year

676
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
right yeah definitely definitely next

677
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
two years

678
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,939
[Laughter]

679
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
top tier hackers they are looking at at

680
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,640
least one million before they don't need

681
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
to work for the year right yeah yeah i

682
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,720
mean it also depends on how complex we

683
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,480
were talking like chain exploit like you

684
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
know i mean how to make it work right

685
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,679
like it's not usually just one bug right

686
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,600
now i mean this plus this plus some you

687
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,120
know sandbox escape plus some other

688
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,159
thing so

689
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,440
it starts to add up you know i mean i'm

690
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
just saying obviously right it's not so

691
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
simple

692
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,559
yeah give me 250 grand yeah but then

693
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,760
that's the thing right there there's

694
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,600
some industry standard on that right but

695
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
then there's folks like you know like uh

696
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
bounty uh brokers right or whatever

697
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
exploit brokers right that will be

698
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
offering some ridiculous amount and

699
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
that's the exact why where in this

700
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
situation right like if you are the guy

701
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,799
who found it you can you know give it to

702
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
huawei get 250k or 500k whatever or then

703
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,880
you can like you know sell it to some

704
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
other guy you don't know what he's going

705
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
to do with it but they're going to add a

706
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
zero to the end you know but

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,559
i'd say

708
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,440
if you want to take the black body

709
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
