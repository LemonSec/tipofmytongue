41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
can't and uh we've been saying that

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
since yeah well since february last year

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,320
pretty much like amsterdam came and when

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
singapore came when cyber week last year

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
came back when this year's amsterdam

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
game and when we're still in singapore

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
now it's still virtual but we still have

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
cyber week bro the last one last one of

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,040
this year hopefully we can like you know

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
get back to in person man but

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
we're missing it man we miss hanging out

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
and like you know drinking and doing

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
crazy stuff man like this is not fun

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
this is not fun and i have a feeling

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
that the the security community is

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
changing and by not being able to

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
organize conferences and meeting people

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,319
and networking and you know

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
that somehow we don't participate in

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
that chain and that that's all wrong

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,480
because it means all the big

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
players you know the big companies are

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
going to be dominating the field soon

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
and that doesn't feel right

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
it doesn't feel right man but i i mean

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,760
it's because the hallway attract right i

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
mean we all know like we go for a

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
conference none of us watch the talks

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
right like that's we are that's right

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
none of us go into the tracks we're like

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
chilling out outside walking around

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,160
smoking a cigarette right and it's the

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
people that you bump into during those

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,519
conversations like hey i haven't seen

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
you for ages like

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
me so and so and those interactions you

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,519
just can't virtualize that man i know

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,840
about a studio zoom blah blah blah it's

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
going to change that you know human

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
absolutely absolutely and i think the

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,400
high tp conferences they played a larger

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
role than you know just being a place

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,519
where you indeed listen to talks because

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
uh you you sort of

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
you were the voice of the community i

86
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
mean those conferences were the voice of

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
the community

88
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
and now that community is largely silent

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
and

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
this can't go on for too long we we need

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,400
that you know

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
we need those young guys making having

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
new ideas on the scene

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
uh

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
we need to see innovative solutions we

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,879
need to

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,360
to keep that community alive and

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
this has been your mission ever since

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,360
you started hitb so this must be a

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
terrible time for you guys i mean i i

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
can't even understand how you guys are

102
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
still standing i really

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
upload what you're doing at the moment

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,959
because

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,640
thank you bro thank you

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
i mean it's like uh yeah it's

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
disheartening you know i mean when we

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
first started hanging the box i mean the

109
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
main reason why we started is because we

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,599
couldn't afford to go to blackhead right

111
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
i mean that was the main thing it was

112
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
super expensive and like you know we

113
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,680
were like hey why don't we bring the

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
cool speakers over to asia and like hang

115
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
out with them here and that intent has

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
always been has always been the same as

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
in like we organized the conferences in

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
amsterdam in dubai whatever but it's

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,040
always about like bringing like our

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
friends together hanging out sitting out

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
catching up and like yeah man it's this

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,760
virtual thing just sucks bro like it's

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
just not the same man like

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
you know what can i say

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,800
well but it's maybe it's a time for

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
reflection you know i think a lot of

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
people they're locked down in their

128
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
house and they they're thinking you know

129
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
what am i gonna do with my life and all

130
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
that and and to some extent this is

131
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,080
what's happening to the industry

132
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
including you know yours mine

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
uh so

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,240
it's time for reflection so you know

135
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
looking back at all those years i'm

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,120
curious

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
as someone who's been really on the

138
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
front lines like you have how do you

139
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
feel the industry has changed i mean

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
what what's the difference between you

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,840
know the first

142
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,639
few hitv conferences and you know what

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
what you've been doing recently what

144
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,670
[Laughter]

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
you and i have been friends

146
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,479
foreign way way way long right we've

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
seen so much change right i mean the the

148
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
community in itself like even in

149
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
malaysia uh we've had folks like milling

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
woodin has become like super corporate

151
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,199
spoonfork i remember i don't really used

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
to remember spoon fog and sk chong right

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
those are like the old school guys right

154
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,639
and they were like the hardcore

155
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,880
technical hackers like malaysia you know

156
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
like malaysian hackers by malaysians

157
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
right and then those guys being

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
cooperate and and they moved on and

159
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
you know as we've progressed over the

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,039
years it's kind of like

161
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,039
i feel like the community has gotten

162
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
kind of like a little bit smaller in the

163
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
sense that everybody else is doing all

164
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
the new stuff

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
they're all it's not that exciting you

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
know i mean we don't see the major

167
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
vulnerability breakthroughs like the new

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
techniques that i was talking to greg

169
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,880
just a while ago right and like he was

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
like in 2003 2004 he was talking about

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
the fisting technique right to hide

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
files in unallocated eye octals i think

173
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
it was it was at that point in time

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
right like in the unallocated file space

175
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,840
hiding stuff inside there so the

176
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
anti-forensics techniques right like

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,360
those are ground breaking techniques but

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
we don't see those today right we see

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
some new one accessories some new day

180
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
that is like it's probably patched

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
already because responsible disclosure

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
or coordinated disclosure

183
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
it's not the same bro like we don't have

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,919
the excitement of gaius coming around

185
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
and like hey check this cool stuff out

186
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,919
remember those days like those were cool

187
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,520
days right

188
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,080
yeah yeah but i think this is um

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
to some extent those discoveries and

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,479
this research still happens but uh

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
because of the way the industry has

192
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,400
evolved this is not happening in public

193
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
anymore

194
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
you know if you if you go back to the

195
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
you know let's go back to the 90s you

196
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,560
know

197
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
before that it was pre-history i don't

198
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
think it's as much that people could

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,639
relate to

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,120
but in the 90s uh you know there was a

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
growth of hacking and the hacking scene

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,599
in general um and if you look at the

203
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,520
defense versus the offense i mean those

204
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
are red team versus the blue team as we

205
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
would say today

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
you could see that uh the bad guys or

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,599
the hackers they

208
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,400
they

209
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
it was the best time for them to play

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
around because the other side didn't

211
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,919
have a clue

212
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,919
and you can't really blame them for not

213
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,360
having a clue because they the

214
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
management didn't think there was a

215
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
problem you know so we had guys that

216
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,800
were supposed to defend corporate

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
infrastructure or even national

218
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
infrastructures and they had no clue no

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
experience no deep knowledge no serious

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
tools the management wasn't interested

221
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
there was no real high profile cases and

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
and the monitor list losses were minimal

223
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
so

224
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,039
yeah

225
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
first for what a decade and you've got a

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
lot of media exposure you've got high

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
profile hacks you've got

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
more and more researchers coming into

229
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
the field

230
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
and suddenly security is on everyone's

231
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
radar including the management

232
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
but if you continue

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
you know the fact that uh hacking become

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,319
more difficult from the technical point

235
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,400
of view means the exploits are becoming

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
more sophisticated

237
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,720
and then some companies say okay maybe

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,199
we can monetize this exploit stuff i

239
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
mean i don't know if you guys remember

240
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,400
what was it called that company i

241
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
defense or something like that yeah they

242
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
were buying exploits at fifty dollars of

243
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
pop yeah

244
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,599
um

245
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,958
but you know they

246
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,919
eventually people say oh wow uh those

247
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,320
exploits could be sold for a lot more

248
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
and i could maybe sell them to

249
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,640
governments or to you know russian

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,760
malware groups and whatnot and suddenly

251
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,959
uh you you monetize something that was

252
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,680
mostly a community effort before you

253
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
monetize the development of exploit so

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,680
that's why you you don't see them

255
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
anymore it's not that they're not there

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,760
i mean you know i'm i'm regularly seeing

257
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
a list of zero days that greg and others

258
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
circulate and man there are some very

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
sophisticated stuff out there it's just

260
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
that the million dollar price tag sort

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
of

262
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,519
you know slows down the adoption of such

263
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,560
techniques in public so um so i'm not

264
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
sure this is actually a good development

265
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,120
because

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
as the whole zero days exploit

267
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,200
development and vulnerability research

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
has basically become a commercial

269
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
enterprise and the prices are so high

270
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
now that you know only uh nation state

271
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,880
actors can actually afford them or

272
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
possibly the

273
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,519
large criminal groups in russia so this

274
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,240
is

275
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,880
where we are now oh bitcoin orders bro

276
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
if you got a lot of bitcoin you can buy

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
a lot of exploits man because like you

278
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
know if you if you had like a thousand

279
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
bitcoin from way back when right

280
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
it's like today you'll be able to buy

281
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,080
almost anything red

282
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
so yeah yeah why isn't someone doing it

283
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
or maybe someone is maybe someone is

284
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,240
right that's the thing just because you

285
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
don't hear about it doesn't mean it's

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
not happening

287
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,839
but do you remember like you know way

288
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,519
back in like i think

289
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
2007 probably like wabi-sabi labi right

290
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
like roberto prior tony did that exploit

291
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
marketplace and everybody went ape

292
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
bro do you remember they were like no

293
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,079
you cannot sell exploits you cannot put

294
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,760
weaponized stuff how can you be

295
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,279
auctioning these things to the highest

296
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
bidder blah blah blah and then fast

297
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,440
forward like you know 2021 right there's

298
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
like bob bounty that's hacker one

299
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,200
there's like various different programs

300
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
you can like sign up for and now it's

301
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
normalized right like no big deal but

302
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,079
what makes something saw bw like was

303
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,760
kind of like ahead of its time i suppose

304
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
right but that was much better as in it

305
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
was like the marketplace what they can

306
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
afford not what the seller decides it

307
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,880
should be worth you know what i mean and

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
then you create this it was a great

309
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
model and you know that italian guy who

310
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
started that is is really cool so i'm

311
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,279
not sure where he got all that grief at

312
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,760
the time

313
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
but yeah the industry has the mentality

314
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
has definitely changed um

315
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,760
and another thing that i mean that we've

316
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,920
seen in our in our job is that as i said

317
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
before you know in the 90s or even the

318
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
decade that followed

319
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
um

320
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,079
it was the site that is defending

321
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
infrastructure and and corporate

322
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,839
entities they don't have the right tools

323
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,160
they they not prepare to defend against

324
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
sophisticated attackers apts and nation

325
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,120
states etc but um in the last few years

326
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,560
we've seen that the edr industry

327
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,000
they really up their game and now i

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
think for the first time since we've

329
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
been doing that you know the red teaming

330
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
job and evaluating infrastructure

331
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
security and all that for the first time

332
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,079
we're seeing tools that are actually

333
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,160
useful

334
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
because before yes they had their fancy

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
firewalls their ideas

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,360
whatever stateful inspection crap it

337
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
never

338
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,279
made any difference those were just toys

339
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,040
that were sold

340
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,120
to those corporations that gives them a

341
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
feel-good security but it never made any

342
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
difference to a sophisticated attacker

343
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,680
however nowadays the edrs

344
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,560
they have

345
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,519
they have reached a level of

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
sophistication and especially we seeing

347
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
them deployed on

348
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,000
linux machine on unique solaris etc with

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
they were not before it was only

350
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
focusing on windows

351
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
so um the game is sort of changing in

352
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
that respect and

353
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
then the the sophisticated attackers

354
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
nowadays they have to

355
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
not only face uh

356
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
you know security admins are a lot more

357
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
clued than before because of the level

358
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
of education and training

359
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,480
and

360
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
all the information they can get

361
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,680
so not only that means a lot better but

362
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,360
the weapons

363
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
that they have are very very

364
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,839
sophisticated and that is changing the

365
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,519
landscape this is for us in the last

366
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,920
three years we've seen that at the very

367
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
focused development effort from the edr

368
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,839
companies that suddenly they're starting

369
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,079
to have tools that are usable i'm not

370
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,320
sure what that means for the

371
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
you know all these apt groups etc but i

372
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
have a feeling that the window of

373
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
opportunity to do all this fun hacking

374
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
is closing um

375
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
again i don't know man i think it's just

376
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,360
it's just gonna move bro like i mean i

377
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,200
think the the fun hacking stuff is just

378
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
gonna move to ai and other kind of

379
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
things that you can still abuse you know

380
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
because inherently it's all built by

381
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
people right and people are inherently

382
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
stupid man like they're just basically

383
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
it they're gonna implement something

384
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
i've been saying for three years that's

385
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
it this is the last year we can play but

386
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,639
actually

387
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
yeah it still continues man i was still

388
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
gainfully employed so yeah good times

389
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,800
for that but like every let's talk about

390
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
telco security right i mean you started

391
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
tstf in 2002.

392
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
um since then right like has the telco

393
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
security landscape changed much are

394
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
still people still abusing ss7 for

395
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,760
example is that still a problem

396
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,800
um oh yeah well the telco securities has

397
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,240
changed

398
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,399
really vastly uh in the last two decades

399
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
because they started from a model we

400
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,320
know that that closed garden model where

401
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
they said well this is our network

402
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,079
nobody can get in so we don't really

403
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,279
have to worry

404
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,600
about our internal stuff it's safe

405
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
and at first that was an adequate

406
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
difference because of the complexity of

407
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
telecom networks and all those obscure

408
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
proprietary protocols

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
it sort of kept the average hackers at

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
bay because it didn't have the technical

411
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
sophistication to navigate those

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,199
networks but eventually that changed

413
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
first they started interconnecting uh

414
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,240
left right and center you know telecom

415
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
networks they were used initially just

416
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
to make phone calls and nowadays i mean

417
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
who is using his

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
you know device to make a phone call i

419
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
mean almost

420
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,360
[Laughter]

421
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
yeah so you're having those networks

422
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,519
that are massively interconnected with

423
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
each other and with service providers

424
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
and with all sorts of external entities

425
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
to their network so that massively

426
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
increase the security parameters uh you

427
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
know attack surface

428
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
and people started realizing two things

429
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,199
about telcos one a telco is like a bank

430
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
in the sense that there's lots of money

431
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,880
inside and two uh a telco is a great

432
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
great source of information on people

433
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,720
you know you can track who they're

434
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,680
calling when uh what messages they sent

435
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
what is the content of those messages uh

436
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
all their private details their payment

437
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,800
history i mean it's it's

438
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
it's a huge information mind for people

439
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,880
who are into that

440
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
you know information gathering about

441
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
people

442
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
we we live with our phones so

443
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
those two factors you know the fact that

444
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
it's being the attack surfaces has

445
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,399
massively increased and people realize

446
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
the financial and intelligence value of

447
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,320
those networks mean they were

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,800
under a lot of attacks and you were

449
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
talking about about ss7 and this is

450
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
still very very much ongoing uh because

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
it's a protocol that cannot really be

452
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
fixed because some vulnerabilities have

453
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
been exposed uh for quite some time

454
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,480
including some very practical

455
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,399
uh implications you know i'm thinking

456
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,399
about the presentation that carlton made

457
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
at the ccc for example that were very

458
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,680
impactful and had a lot of uh

459
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
you know inspired a lot of people

460
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,880
including including positive

461
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,360
technologies to you know to further the

462
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
industry and then there was a the

463
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,320
private players that say oh well i i can

464
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
make a business out of that

465
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
i know there's a couple of israeli

466
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
companies that started marketing that as

467
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,519
a service

468
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
then some u.s companies as well and they

469
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
started mixing that with tech industry

470
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,279
you know

471
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,480
you know that your phone has an

472
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,040
advertising id right yeah

473
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
that advertising id is tracked all over

474
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
the place but by multiple techniques

475
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
right even some developers are inserting

476
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
a sdk in your software that you know

477
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,199
sends all sorts of data outside

478
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,600
uh or the advertiser are gathering the

479
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
data to make a so-called anonymous

480
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,959
profiling on you i don't even understand

481
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,520
that it doesn't contain any information

482
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,839
that identifies you but that's actually

483
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,319
ludicrous because if i know that that

484
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,400
advertising id is sleeping every day in

485
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
the same place and during every day to

486
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
the same workplace it's not that

487
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,079
difficult to de-anonymize him right so

488
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
there's a whole cottage industry mixing

489
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
uh you know all this uh temco stuff with

490
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
uh

491
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
advertising information and basically

492
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
they're making that a business telling

493
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
where are people located and what are

494
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,640
they doing

495
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
and it's becoming huge

496
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,440
so ss7 is used to track the location of

497
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,480
people

498
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,799
now you've got ss7 firewalls that are

499
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,600
blocking that and people

500
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
some operators are telling me that

501
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,440
they're seeing who is attacking them

502
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
um so in in in itself this is a as

503
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,799
intelligence value to know that oh a

504
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,720
nation state is interested in those

505
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
numbers so they actually find out who is

506
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
attacking them then they return the

507
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,440
wrong information to them to

508
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
so it has become a cat and mouse game

509
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,960
still very much ongoing

510
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
operators are never really quick at

511
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
patching their vulnerability especially

512
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,919
in ways that's protocol level and even

513
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,840
more so when it's a protocol that cannot

514
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
be fixed so yeah to answer your

515
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
questions those attacks still very much

516
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,200
ongoing the telcos are under hassle left

517
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
right and center from nation states

518
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,280
and

519
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,000
[Music]

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
yeah i'm not sure they're winning

521
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
thankfully as i said

522
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
no we sing they still are victim to some

523
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
horrendous acts

524
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,039
but the the fact that the edr industry i

525
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
think there's someone in the india

526
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
company that say

527
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
hey those telcos they've got a lot of

528
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
money let's do rounds and and

529
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
they they've suddenly we we're seeing

530
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
them everywhere and every telcos those

531
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
edrs detecting all sorts of stuff and

532
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
having signatures they share with each

533
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,000
other so the game is changing and as you

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
said maybe it's just

535
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,760
a a change in sophistication maybe ai

536
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,480
hacking and all that is the future but

537
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
how does that happen without humans

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
no the humans are definitely going to be

539
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
part of the problem bro like without

540
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
humans there won't be no hacking man

541
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
because there won't be any bounce words

542
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
to fight right it's always

543
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,880
misconfiguration some idiot that plugs

544
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,000
something in that shouldn't have been

545
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
plugged in or like you know configured

546
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,280
some ss7 endpoint that shouldn't have

547
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,840
been publicly accessible

548
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,919
but uh you know talking about attackers

549
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
right like how easy would you say i mean

550
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,600
i'm just talking about like you know

551
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
historically right like we used to talk

552
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,280
about like misconfigured uh accessible

553
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,360
publicly accessible ss7 endpoints in

554
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,440
bulgaria that you could then query right

555
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,520
so that you can like put in the msisdn

556
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,280
and find out where that phone is how

557
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,960
prevalent is that today as in is that

558
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,400
has that problem been solved has the

559
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,160
telcos already close those doors so that

560
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,400
you can just kind of like it's been sold

561
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
to some extent because it's been

562
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,679
publicly exposed you know um p1 sec

563
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,400
did scan all those vulnerable services

564
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,679
and publish them so a lot of telcos

565
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,159
actually noticed seven abilities and

566
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,360
patched that

567
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
so it's not as prevalent as it used to

568
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,360
be

569
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
no not not at all however

570
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
they're still very much

571
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
open to vulnerabilities between

572
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,480
operators because they consider that

573
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
yeah public exposure is bad and it's

574
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,280
easily

575
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,840
scanned it's easily patched but the

576
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
interconnection between different

577
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
operators cannot

578
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
be

579
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600
locked out as easily and so what we're

580
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,760
seeing is we're seeing some sort of

581
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
hostile entities that are

582
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,799
officially registered you know with

583
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,159
with the itu they have their own uh

584
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,720
you know gtp they have their own

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
addresses they have their own ss7 uh

586
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
point codes etc so they all look legit

587
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,440
but they actually just been set up for

588
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,799
the purpose of

589
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
you know implementing attacks that are

590
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
between operators as opposed to from the

591
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,679
public side to operators uh so they're

592
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
still very much vulnerable to those

593
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
uh to those attacks however they cannot

594
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
be easily implemented by just some guy

595
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
on the internet scanning okay right you

596
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
need to have access to one operator to

597
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
compromise another

598
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,159
uh but it's

599
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,200
yeah

600
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
a little bit more difficult

601
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,000
and all that

602
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
so what's the future of uh telco

603
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,120
security man i mean as a formula

604
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,480
attacker standpoint right like where

605
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
should i be looking and we were talking

606
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
about 5g and stuff like if i was just

607
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
starting to get into telco security and

608
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,440
i wanted to look for some cool stuff to

609
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,799
research right which areas do you think

610
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,720
i should be looking at

611
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
well the 5g security is interesting

612
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
because every time they you know they

613
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
change the generation they try to

614
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
improve security but

615
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
uh with with various degrees of success

616
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,880
um with 5gs they've chosen to open up

617
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
the protocols a bit more

618
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,919
but the the attack surface surfaces

619
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,640
is huge because the complexity

620
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,360
of all those iit devices that are going

621
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,240
to follow one standard of another and

622
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
the fact that people are going to to

623
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,720
deploy them at a huge pace in the next

624
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,480
few years

625
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,480
i mean that's i think there's going to

626
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,080
be some very interesting security

627
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,439
research coming out of that field

628
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,159
yeah i i think if i was to

629
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,559
get into telco security nowadays this is

630
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,320
probably where i would go you know to

631
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
research on the

632
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,720
pro at the protocol level on 5g because

633
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,480
there actually is many different kind of

634
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,919
protocols there are many ways to

635
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,360
implement iot

636
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
and many ways to

637
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,679
make those devices

638
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,600
perform all those security functions

639
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
however uh

640
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,039
as you said you know the human factor is

641
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,200
always going to be there i know people

642
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
are going to want to deploy millions of

643
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,960
those devices

644
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
and

645
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
we we see it every day the security

646
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,600
level is not on par with that so we can

647
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,320
expect some very interesting research

648
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
coming out of that field

649
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
and i think it's happening already

650
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,039
we're seeing some deployments uh 5g

651
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
networks and we're already seeing some

652
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,840
security or did some protocol weaknesses

653
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,520
the usual stuff that they do you know

654
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,120
they try to evolve

655
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
a protocol that is not very secure they

656
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,799
create one that is not really more

657
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,919
secure and it takes another three years

658
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
to change that

659
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
same whole same wall right like nothing

660
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,600
much has changed man slap a new name on

661
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
it and then hopefully nobody notices

662
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,158
that we didn't change anything

663
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
oh no it's true um

664
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
and and there are some of our partners

665
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,919
that are really

666
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
looking for ways to make that better

667
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
including well we need some some people

668
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,039
who can be trained to handle this kind

669
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,400
of incidents

670
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
you know some

671
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,360
i'm sure that you've experienced that

672
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,000
with cyber week you know the uae is

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,760
looking for skill they're looking for

674
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,360
capabilities

675
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
they don't really know how to do that

676
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,320
because they don't have enough local

677
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,919
resources

678
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,799
so

679
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,799
it's always a game of having

680
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,480
a proper

681
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,279
team that can defend your resources and

682
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,679
you know the human factor is very

683
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,159
important because you can't find

684
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,000
those people easily and it's one area

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
that i think is very important is to get

686
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
people up to skill

687
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,320
i don't know i mean like if you think

688
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
about like talking about skill the skill

689
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,440
gap that exists right like um

690
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
from the time that you were with dstf

691
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
then now you're with telecom

692
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,039
intelligence right tics right in terms

693
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,960
of the skills like where do you even

694
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,360
begin to find the type of people that

695
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
would be the right fit to do telco

696
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
security because it's like it's radio

697
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,120
you know i mean there's a lot of various

698
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
different technologies that are involved

699
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,919
with it that the barrier to entry to

700
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,159
kind of like finding like you know new

701
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
guys that can move the needle

702
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
it's not that easy so where would you

703
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
begin i mean like you know for you guys

704
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,320
do you guys hire your folks from and

705
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
then your researchers to join your team

706
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,880
right it's it's a very difficult problem

707
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,159
because uh

708
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,000
and for two reasons first there's a

709
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
skill level that's involved and second

710
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,919
you know because we work with

711
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,360
uh you know telco they are considered a

712
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,600
national security or national critical

713
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
infrastructure so we can't

714
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,760
you know send any young guys and say why

715
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,840
don't you hack that network and let us

716
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,720
know about it uh is there's a trust that

717
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,200
is involved so uh

718
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
it it sounds silly but it's

719
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
easier to find skill guys that is it it

720
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,919
is to find trustworthy guys and so

721
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,279
we

722
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,799
we like to

723
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,120
to get people and train them up in telco

724
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,640
security you know they come from the

725
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,159
security

726
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,000
pen testing red teaming angle they

727
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
mostly have a focus on you know

728
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,760
traditional infrastructure like windows

729
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,279
unix etc

730
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,960
and so we take them into our team and we

731
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
we grow them we train them up to

732
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
understand all the telco stuff which

733
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,640
they usually find fascinating so i think

734
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,799
the new generation is the future of that

735
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,480
industry

736
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
we're very much looking to you know get

737
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
new blood in and train them into

738
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
handling those complex networks

739
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
and of course all that

740
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
situation at the moment makes that

741
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,919
difficult because we can't travel to our

742
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,120
clients we can travel to meet potential

743
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,559
people to recruit

744
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,360
uh

745
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
it's it's made the whole thing a bit

746
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,039
more difficult i mean we were used to

747
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,279
work remotely with our clients before

748
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
but you still need to meet them from

749
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
time to time and you know this is

750
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,679
dragging on for too long now so how do

751
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,960
you guys have been handling it i mean

752
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
like since gobi started until now right

753
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
i mean i'm guessing telco security

754
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
audits can't be done across the internet

755
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
right or maybe they can i'm not sure

756
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,840
well we were doing that before you know

757
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
once uh once we made a deal with an

758
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,240
operator we you know we set up our vpn

759
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,960
and

760
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,480
we have procedures with them to

761
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
australize connection etc so that allow

762
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
us to

763
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
to work like if we were connected

764
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
locally i mean we've been doing that for

765
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,520
years before the commit hit right and

766
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,679
so forth it was second nature the good

767
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,480
thing about that kovid scare is that now

768
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
everybody understands remote work we

769
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,880
don't have to lobby for that or we don't

770
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
have to face management scrutiny or oh

771
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,679
they're going to connect to our network

772
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,720
from another country now everybody does

773
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
that so at least

774
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,360
that's one good thing

775
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
remote work is totally accepted by

776
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,039
everyone right

777
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
that's awesome that's awesome

778
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
okay bro i think we're pretty much we're

779
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960

784
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,440
the expo is going on over there

785
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
cyber week is uh it's a hybrid model

786
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,679
right so there will be some

787
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,360
some real stuff happening some real

788
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,480

really i'd really like to go on

792
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,880
something that really interests me from

793
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
that cyber week is uh

794
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,200
you know finding the

795
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,640
the next cyber warriors that can help uh

796
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,760
you know different critical

797
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,840
infrastructure i think it's an important

798
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,320
mission of that of that conference

799
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
and i i hope you know we can be more

800
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,880
involved with that effort let's do a

801
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,039
telco hacking contest bro

802
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,120
let's think about it contest

803
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,399
it's like those ctfs you know you find

804
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,960
some really nice talent but once you've

805
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,799
identified them you need to do something

806
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,480
with them and i think there's a lot to

807
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,600
do there

808
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,720
oh let's talk about it soon bro sounds

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
well you see it depends on who

837
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
administers the test and that's why

838
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,360
sometimes i'm just screaming at them and

839
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,399
say hey why usually it doesn't hurt and

840
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
now i'm going to be in pain for two days

841
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,399
because you just stuff that stick of

842
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,240
mine

843
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
but every time i'm thinking you know we

844
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,840
in 2021 why do we need to put cotton

845
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,000
sticks up someone's nose to detect

846
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,799
something man what technology is that

847
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,399
exactly well like you know i've been

848
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
like what is this like ancient aliens

849
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,960
technology that we're using

850
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
don't we have something better than a

851
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
home kit so you can just spit into it

852
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,159

854
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,440
