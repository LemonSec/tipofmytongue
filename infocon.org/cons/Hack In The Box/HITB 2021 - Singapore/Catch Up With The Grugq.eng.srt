65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
malaysia so we're sitting in the studio

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,519
in kuala lumpur

70
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,440
i think singapore is fine i think it's

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,319
okay

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,280
they're taking a lot better than

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,599
malaysia yeah at least

74
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
they're doing a lot better yeah i hope

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,959
your numbers are doing a lot better uh

76
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,480
yeah here things are not so great man

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,840
like the number is like 20 something

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,519
thousand cases per day

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
uh you know

80
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
just madness it's never here

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
you're still in thailand right good

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,519
yeah still some bangkok statement yeah

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,280
it's pretty much the same thing i think

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,599
over here is over there but the vaccine

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,519
drives and stuff going i mean like at

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,120
least they're running out vaccines and

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
stuff already right

88
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
yeah like um

89
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
like if it's a politically sensitive

90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
topic you're not supposed to talk about

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
it but

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,040
uh

93
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
like a lot of the companies have failed

94
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
to come through on their promises that

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
the government made okay

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,238
sounds familiar sounds familiar bro

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,360
uh what you know how it is what you've

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
been researching that i mean since

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,840
you've been stuck at home right like

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
what you've been doing to keep yourself

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
busy

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
i've uh so i've been i've been doing

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,439
like quite a lot of um just like pure

104
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,798
cyber theory stuff and um

105
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,120
a lot more sort of just unlike uh how

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
states interact with each other

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
um like the

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,360
like cyber conflict like

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,400
uh

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
war that is below the threshold of armed

111
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
conflict like things that are now a lot

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
more interesting to me than um like

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
technical things is sort of how

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
cyber can be used to manipulate states

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,880
and make them do things

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,320
and also um because

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
like the the way that

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,919
the world exists right now is states are

119
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,600
not actually the only or even

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
necessarily the dominant power

121
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
so a lot of the time what's interesting

122
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
is not necessarily manipulating states

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
but manipulating companies

124
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
so um

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
like one excellent example would be the

126
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,360
uh the north koreans when they attacked

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
sony in 2014

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,080
they weren't trying to make the us

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
ban um

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
movies about north korea right like it

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
wasn't an attempt to make uh the us do

132
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,759
censorship

133
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,919
but it was an attempt to make film

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
companies

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
avoid uh doing things that would upset

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
north korea and it has been

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
successful right um there haven't been

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
any

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
any new movies

140
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,919
from north korea so

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,440
you know like it's quite interesting

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
that you can you can target things other

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
than nation states and achieve

144
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
objectives that match with your

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,479
strategic goals so this i find very very

146
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,880
interesting i think it's um

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
something that's not dealt with enough

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
like there's not a lot of um

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
people aren't really looking at it

150
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,319
enough um the other thing i've been

151
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,160
doing is trying to

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
sort of demonstrate how a lot of the

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
things that we just sort of see

154
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
regularly are actually strategic

155
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,560
for example

156
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
ransomware is

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
like people like to look at it simply

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
through the

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
the rubric of cybercrime and how it's a

160
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,199
criminal act but

161
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,160
that's

162
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
like that sort of that would be sort of

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
like treating piracy as theft like

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
pirates just rob when that's not

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
necessarily true like uh

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
privateers would rob and give money to

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,120
the state therefore the state sponsored

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
them because it was part of their

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
strategic objectives

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,160
similarly um ransomware is in alignment

171
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
with the strategic objectives of

172
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
certain states so

173
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
it's done within the

174
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
rubric of a grand strategy a way of

175
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,639
achieving

176
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,039
um goals for

177
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,880
that state

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,120
so anyway um that's what i've been doing

179
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,759
stuff as always but when you talk about

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
actors right i mean i'm guessing like

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
russia is always top of everybody's

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
radar right

183
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
yeah yeah so yeah like russia obviously

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
they do a lot but um

185
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,720
god you're reminding me like yeah so

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
i've also been doing upset stuff so like

187
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
one

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
like one thing i've been doing recently

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,400
is i've been trying to take um

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
the comsack stuff that i did a long time

191
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
ago and make that available

192
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
to people so uh communication security

193
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
um sort of like basically

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
how to be secure when you talk to people

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
um and

196
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
more than just encrypting everything so

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,440
yeah like cops like has been one of the

198
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
other things i've been working on um

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,240
i've got

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
a lot of that um

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
sort of down on paper which turned out

202
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
to be a bad thing because

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
i have to take it off of paper and put

204
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,199
it onto a computer

205
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,919
[Laughter]

206
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
very insightful but um

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
yeah so yeah sorry calm side but like

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
yeah russia is a big deal but you know

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,680
even

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
like even the way we talk about um

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
cyber crime actors versus like abt or

212
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
state actors i think

213
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
we sort of fail to recognize important

214
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
things so for example

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
um you know people go like oh it's

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
financially motivated it's like

217
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
 you know like

218
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
the entire world is financially

219
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
motivated how the do you think

220
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,240
capitalism works

221
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
right like when we did state directed

222
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
stuff we got communism and it

223
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
fell apart right when you have like

224
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,480
money directed like financially

225
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
motivated markets and financially

226
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
motivated countries

227
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,800
you win the cold war so you know

228
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
i don't think it's really a great idea

229
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
to make fun of them just because they

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,839
want to make money and money is a very

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
good way of allocating resources and

232
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
motivating people to do things

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
i mean

234
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,440
like everything we have is basically

235
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
built because of money like

236
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
what the it's not like it's not

237
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
like just because it's it's like not as

238
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,959
pure as like ideals

239
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,000
it doesn't mean that it's not an

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
effective way of getting people to do

241
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
things

242
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,399
what's that hey but talking about secure

243
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,680
comps right weren't you working on like

244
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
a private phone or a secure phone or

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
something like a hardware device yeah

246
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,760
yeah for quite a while but um

247
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
i think maybe the market has changed now

248
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,240
but back then see like the the big

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
trouble is that you

250
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
you either make something that

251
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
people can afford and then um in order

252
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
to get to that you need to have like

253
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
investment you have to you know sell

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
millions of devices

255
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
or you have something that um a select

256
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
few people can afford but then you have

257
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
to find a way to get people to spend

258
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
five thousand dollars on their phone

259
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
and

260
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
you know like

261
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
people want to spend 500 bucks on the

262
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
phone and

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,480
people don't want to spend 5 000 but if

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
you you know if you're selling a phone

265
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
500 bucks and you sell like 20 of them

266
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
in a year yeah you can't run a company

267
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,040
on that yeah yeah yeah yeah so you have

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
to go the other way it's quite hard to

269
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,160
do

270
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
um so yeah i don't know man uh i i gave

271
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,279
up on that but

272
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
i might take some of the stuff i did and

273
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
make it available for free because

274
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,519
uh otherwise it's just sort of gathering

275
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,560
bit rot

276
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
so i mean if you're talking about upset

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
for like just general people right i

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
think like security researchers that

279
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
have you know exploits or whatever right

280
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
like what would your suggestions be like

281
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
yeah like okay so first of all a

282
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
um a modern

283
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
android

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
phone like aosp you know just a

285
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,519
clear vanilla with no google stuff

286
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,920
um if you can get graphene os on a

287
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,399
modern google device that's great if you

288
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,959
can't you can use aosp

289
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,200
you know compile yourself don't

290
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
pull it off of the forum or something

291
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
like that because it's usually badly put

292
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
together anyway

293
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
like that is very very secure it's going

294
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
to be more secure than

295
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,600
your laptop

296
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
generally speaking

297
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
so that's like that's step one but like

298
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
step two or okay actually step one is

299
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,079
you need to have more than one device so

300
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,760
uh my my rule of thumb is uh one device

301
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,959
per vice

302
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,470
wow so

303
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,630
[Laughter]

304
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,720
[Music]

305
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,760
you know

306
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
be selective in your vices i guess the

307
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,920
thing is um what you want to do is you

308
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,399
want to minimize the impact

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,560
of a problem

310
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,519
so

311
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,680
if you have your personal device that's

312
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,440
got you know like your bank and your

313
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
your regular email and all your stuff

314
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,399
like that

315
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
you don't want that to be compromised

316
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
and then impact your work stuff but

317
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,200
similarly you don't want to compromise

318
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
on your work to then

319
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,079
impact

320
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,279
you know

321
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
your life so

322
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
you need to at least have a separation

323
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
and you need to make sure that you don't

324
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,000
mix and match things between them and

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
that's simply because um you assume at

326
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,519
least one of them is going to be

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
compromised and you want to make sure

328
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
that

329
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,000
whatever is sort of compromised and

330
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
stolen from there

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
doesn't impact the rest of your stuff

332
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,760
um you know wouldn't it be better to

333
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,279
just assume that you're compromised

334
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
anyway and it tends to act accordingly

335
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
don't do anything bad

336
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
that's what we're here doing but

337
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
both now and um if things change in the

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,079
future don't do anything that might be

339
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,600
considered bad

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
at some point in time in the future so

341
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
it's very easy just be uh perfectly

342
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,079
predictable in vanilla but um

343
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,600
you know like the

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,959
the thing with opsec is like there's

345
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,040
three c's which is uh cover concealment

346
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
and compartmentation so

347
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,000
uh cover means that uh what you're doing

348
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
has a plausible and legitimate

349
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
reason

350
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
behind it so if someone looks at

351
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,800
you know why you're sending encrypted

352
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
communications to someone

353
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,000
it should be because

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,079
talking with them is not weird right

355
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
like you you shouldn't be sending

356
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
encrypted communications like the

357
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
russian embassy that's gonna stand out

358
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,160
but you know sending encrypted

359
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
communications to

360
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,440
someone who is

361
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
you know a friend

362
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
that's reasonable so

363
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,959
the next one is concealment so you want

364
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
to have it um

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,800
it's hidden so that the

366
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,959
uh like overt view like if someone just

367
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,160
looks at it it's not going to be

368
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,839
immediately apparent that it's something

369
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,360
dodgy or sneaky

370
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
so cover

371
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
make sure that it's got a plausible

372
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,199
explanation and a legal or legitimate

373
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
explanation uh concealment make sure

374
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
that people can't really see it and then

375
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
compartmentation just to have

376
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,880
um as i said you know like

377
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
one device provides it's basically to

378
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,760
make sure that the um the things that

379
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,880
you're doing

380
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
don't interact with each other and they

381
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
don't have links to each other so

382
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,440
uh if you have a secret email account

383
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
don't forward those emails to your

384
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
regular account and don't forget your

385
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
regular emails to that account

386
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
um that was actually one of the ways

387
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,480
that a um

388
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
a guy got busted in the u.s was that he

389
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,079
set up a secret email

390
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,760
for um talking with a reporter and then

391
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
because

392
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
he wanted to access it at work he had

393
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,920
his work

394
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
and that one both forwarding to each

395
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,720
other so that um when the

396
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
like basically when they investigated

397
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,440
his work and they found that like oh

398
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
yeah like he's got all these like you

399
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
know don't

400
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
secret so and so yahoo.com let's go and

401
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,320
look at that

402
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,000
and you know they found everything there

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
so because he hadn't compartmented

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
because it was um you know hopelessly

405
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,199
intermixed

406
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,000
he

407
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
was exposed so you know it's cover

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
consumer compartmentation the three c's

409
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
how do you keep track of which device

410
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
you use twice you like write it down

411
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
somewhere the red phone is for this the

412
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,040
blackboard

413
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,399
ordering stuff

414
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
yeah no it's like it's it's difficult

415
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
like the way the way i did it when i had

416
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
like more than two like two it's easy

417
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
you've got work and you've got personal

418
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,800
that's not a big problem

419
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,240
but um i had a like i had drawers so i

420
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
would have like one drawer would be

421
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,959
focused on the thing and then i could

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,920
just put

423
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
each device in the correct place and

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,240
remember what's what so

425
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,320
that's um

426
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
i think that's what i used to do but it

427
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,120
like it's hard like every every

428
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,639
phone is just like it's a black

429
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
rectangle they all look the same you

430
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
know and then uh

431
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,240
if you don't remember to put it in the

432
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
exact same space then like two weeks

433
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
later when you need it again

434
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
you're not sure which is which

435
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,639
it's not fun

436
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,360
um you know you could label things uh

437
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,639
like i

438
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,639
at one point i tried to do that like

439
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
nail polish i wanted to get uh just the

440
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,560
primary colors like

441
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
red

442
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
uh blue

443
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,759
yellow right so um

444
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
i also don't know how to buy a nail

445
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
polish i've got no idea where it is or

446
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
whatever so i i asked a friend like so i

447
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,399
said this girl like here's some money

448
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,600
can you like get me some nail polish

449
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,920
and she came back with like three shades

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,759
of green and i said i need like red

451
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,160
blue and yellow and she came back and

452
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
she said these will look better on you

453
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
i'm sick with style bro i'm sick with

454
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
stars

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,720
now i have to remember which of three

456
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
shades of green is the right

457
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,800
shade

458
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,160
when you're traveling bro i mean like

459
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
you know if you're having to cross

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
borders right that's a whole different

461
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,199
ball game already right how do you how

462
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,800
do you integrate yeah yeah

463
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,600
so

464
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
so the the way uh like the way to cross

465
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
borders is to just basically

466
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,000
what's called

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
traveling naked so

468
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
naked means that you don't have anything

469
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,119
compromising on you at all so you have a

470
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,280
device that's got nothing problematic

471
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,880
it's completely clean

472
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
so

473
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,359
you assume that you're gonna get you

474
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,039
know investigated you're gonna have your

475
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,199
stuff copied people are gonna look at it

476
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
but because there's nothing there it

477
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
doesn't matter

478
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,600
once you've passed that checkpoint then

479
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,799
once you've gone to your hotel and so on

480
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,559
that's when you can start acquiring the

481
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,160
things that you need so

482
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
um if you're truly traveling naked you

483
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
wouldn't purchase a device until

484
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
you're in the country right

485
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,240
because

486
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
you know like that's that's the correct

487
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
way to do it that's very expensive um

488
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,120
the the other way you can do it is if

489
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
you have all of your stuff on the cloud

490
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
right so

491
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,360
like the

492
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,440
like there's one way to do it with an

493
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
iphone which is it's quite painful but

494
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,520
basically you set your iphone up you

495
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,160
create so like you do all your stuff you

496
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
have it backed up to icloud

497
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
then you set it up

498
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
as a different device and have that not

499
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,679
backed up to icloud uh okay okay okay

500
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,280
then

501
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,320
right

502
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,000
so you set that up it's clean it looks

503
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
nice it's got all the you know nothing

504
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
compromising on it once you've crossed

505
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,640
the border

506
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,000
you then reset and you do a

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,640
re-image off of your icloud at which

508
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
point you now have your real phone again

509
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
i mean then you know you do the same

510
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
thing

511
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,919
what about like i mean how concerned

512
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,919
should it be about like stingrays and

513
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,919
you know that kind of stuff as in like

514
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
interception right that's happening like

515
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
you know on-site at your hotel for

516
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
example they compromise the access

517
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,679
points and those kind of things

518
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,520
really like it's not a

519
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,559
realistic

520
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,360
threat i think for most people um like

521
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
the the technology is out there it's

522
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
used

523
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,120
but

524
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
you know

525
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
people don't use gsm or 3g that much

526
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,120
it's all uh 4g and 5g these days they're

527
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,240
a lot

528
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
like they're a lot safer they're not

529
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
actually safe but they're a lot better

530
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
than

531
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,799
um it used to be and

532
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,760
it's sort of it's fairly unlikely that

533
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
they'll be able to do anything other

534
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,679
than pinpoint your exact location which

535
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,000
you know that's a problem but that's a

536
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
different set of

537
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
concerns than uh device security right

538
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
so if you want like location security

539
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
and you have a phone

540
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,440
um

541
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
you're going to have a bad time

542
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
so

543
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,120
yeah

544
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
like it depends on what you're trying to

545
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
do like i think the the number one

546
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
upside thing i would say is um

547
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,120
follow like the the opsec plan the

548
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
five-step outside plan which is what are

549
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,039
you trying to protect

550
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
um who are you trying to protect it from

551
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,679
like what's the worst that can happen

552
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,760
um then how

553
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
sort of do you like who you're

554
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,720
protecting it from and the worst that

555
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
can happen order it so that like the

556
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
the worst thing is protected before

557
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
like the least worst thing you know just

558
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,720
prioritizing all that then come up with

559
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,840
a way of doing that protection and then

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
actually do it so

561
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
you know figure out what you're trying

562
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,080
to do

563
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
and figure out what goes wrong so you

564
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
can prior you can prioritize it figure

565
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,840
out who you're trying to protect against

566
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,200
so you know what

567
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,039
um the threats are that you're facing

568
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
and then

569
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,400
you know you can go ahead and do it if

570
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
you just

571
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,880
go out and say like what can i protect

572
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
against and figure out different things

573
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
you won't get anywhere because it's

574
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
meaningless you know

575
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
it's important to actually know

576
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,760
uh like why you're doing things and then

577
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,840
choose things that uh help you achieve

578
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
your objectives

579
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
i used to do any work with

580
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,919
anti-forensics because you were one of

581
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
the pioneers for anti-foreign techniques

582
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,840
right yeah so

583
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
one of one of the interesting things now

584
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,039
is um

585
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
i'm sort of i'm returning to my

586
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
anti-forensic stuff because i've been

587
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
i've been talking to people

588
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,799
in um they've been researching malware

589
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,720
and apts and they're like oh yeah now

590
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,760
everyone's doing like living off the

591
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,200
land it's really difficult you know

592
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
everyone uses cobalt strike it's really

593
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,000
going like

594
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
i i

595
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
this is anti-forensics i did this like

596
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
20 years ago i explained how like all of

597
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,000
this works and why and everything and so

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,400
um like the the foundation the

599
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
foundational theories i came up with if

600
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
you know like uh reducing the amount of

601
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,440
information you leave behind and the

602
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
ways to go about doing it and all that

603
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
all of those things are now

604
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,159
actually being implemented you know 20

605
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,559
years later so i'm

606
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,320
i've been returning to that and i want

607
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,400
to um

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,760
sort of

609
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,559
re rewrite it for

610
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,720
the the modern um

611
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,240
like the modern set of threats that we

612
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
face because i don't think

613
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,799
linux file systems are as critical

614
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,760
as um you know understanding sort of why

615
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,159
uh threat actors will operate in certain

616
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
ways and where they're likely to go

617
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,799
so yeah like that a lot of the

618
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
anti-forensic stuff is

619
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
that was sort of very very novel back

620
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,480
then is now absolutely standard but even

621
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,440
more so the theories behind why to do it

622
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
like the the concepts that were being

623
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,640
implemented and the

624
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,400
foundations for why to do things you

625
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,360
know like

626
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
staying in memory yeah you know that's

627
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,919
standard now right um to make sure that

628
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,440
there is

629
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,559
you know nothing left behind that can be

630
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
used like just encryption everywhere

631
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,240
to make sure that things get deleted

632
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,760
properly to make sure that there aren't

633
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
like artifacts and that if there are

634
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
artifacts that they're um not uniquely

635
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
tied to a specific actor to use generic

636
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,200
things

637
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,159
to

638
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,039
have sort of very very short durations

639
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,440
of operation because

640
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
those are the times when you're sort of

641
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
at peak vulnerability so you'd have

642
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
things like your um

643
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,280
your actual implant would not do very

644
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,679
much you know it would accept

645
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,640
say a python script and execute that

646
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,000
and so

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
what you would actually do when you're

648
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
doing your attack is you'd be sending on

649
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,679
like when you'd be going hands-on and

650
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,760
you'd interact with the thing you'd send

651
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
the python script that does what you

652
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,919
want to do right and then

653
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,480
when it's done it gets deleted so that

654
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,159
unless someone captured that exact

655
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,640
snapshot they'll have no idea

656
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
you know what your objectives are

657
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,919
because you won't leave that information

658
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,600
behind so

659
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
you know these these things are now

660
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
becoming more and more standard but it's

661
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
you know um as far as i can tell people

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
are viewing this as a

663
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
like it's some sort of evolution and

664
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,679
progression as things are getting more

665
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,720
and more complex but it's not it's just

666
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,320
you know like

667
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,760
we we know why they're going to do it

668
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,279
and where they're going to go

669
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,520
but people are surprised by it because

670
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,640
they haven't thought about it from the

671
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,559
point of view of

672
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,360
the security of those sorts of

673
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,039
operations like that aspect of security

674
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,159
gets ignored um at my point like back

675
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,159
when i was doing it was about forensics

676
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
analysis now it's about uh instant

677
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
response but it's you know it's still a

678
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
part of security and attacking that part

679
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
is still something we need to think

680
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,480
about

681
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,679
yeah i mean even when you talk about

682
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,200
i've actually thought about it already

683
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,760
so you guys don't need to do it

684
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
i mean even when you talk about incident

685
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,120
response and detection right like a lot

686
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
of the chat actors probably aren't using

687
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
such advanced techniques but people are

688
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,400
still finding it only after like months

689
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,919
years later you know what i mean it's in

690
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,840
the tractors have been there forever

691
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
and it's only because you know

692
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
by some way out means that they

693
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,559
discovered it you know but they were in

694
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,159
the system for a very long time and they

695
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,919
didn't need these advanced techniques in

696
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,360
order to hide themselves right they were

697
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,559
hiding in plain sight so to speak yeah

698
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,840
exactly

699
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,039
i mean there's

700
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
like that was another thing i looked at

701
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
at one point is that um

702
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
basically uh time is a factor in

703
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
offensive operations and

704
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,679
sort of one thing that comes up is that

705
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,559
if

706
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,320
you know if you're a threat actor if you

707
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
if you give the defender infinite time

708
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,480
they're going to detect you because

709
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
your your

710
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
you know like your security just

711
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
degrades over time that's the way it is

712
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,520
but um if you don't give them infinite

713
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,720
time then you know things switch

714
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,159
you can if you can reduce the amount of

715
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
time that they have to find you

716
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
then um

717
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,039
you know they have to be lucky as

718
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
opposed to

719
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
um you know you being unlucky whatever

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
it so

721
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,520
like

722
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
there's a lot of very interesting things

723
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,440
that could happen which i think don't

724
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,039
happen just because

725
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,320
um

726
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
threat actors are not as sophisticated

727
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
as they should be yet you know i think

728
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,279
particularly the ones that we see

729
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,679
getting written up there you know

730
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,720
and

731
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
they're the ones that get caught you

732
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
know uh the ones that are really good

733
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,919
that don't get caught

734
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,000
we don't see as much written about them

735
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,840
and they they're a lot more interesting

736
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
than the techniques they use

737
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
sort of the theories that they're

738
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,240
applying those are a lot more

739
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,880
interesting overall

740
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
have you seen any new have you observed

741
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,880
any newer novel techniques in terms of

742
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
anti-forensics because you've been doing

743
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,080
this a long time

744
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,960
yeah

745
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,840
so uh like the

746
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
one that i found

747
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
um

748
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,720
it's called uh gargoyle lanterns that

749
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
it's like i only found out about it

750
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,520
recently but it came out a couple years

751
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,159
ago um basically what it does is it's

752
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,960
um when it executes

753
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,840
it's

754
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
does it in a regional memory that's

755
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,919
marked you know like execute whatever

756
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
before it stops execution it

757
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
creates this like little rock gadget

758
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,240
thing

759
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
which um it will

760
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
basically it turns the memory region

761
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,679
that it's in

762
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,760
non-executable

763
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,320
returns does some regular stuff and then

764
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,279
when

765
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,159
the um process like when that part gets

766
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,440
run again

767
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,080
it goes and it executes this rope gadget

768
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
which then makes that region of memory

769
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,400
executable okay continues in there and

770
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
then before stopping it's you know makes

771
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
itself not executable and sets up this

772
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
rob catches game and what that ends up

773
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,679
doing

774
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
is um a lot of memory

775
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
forensics tools

776
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,880
copy out executable regions of memory

777
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,480
so they'll grab a process and they'll

778
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,080
pull all of the executable stuff because

779
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,000
the data is just going to be huge

780
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
so they look at the executable stuff and

781
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
with this approach

782
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
you know you won't be in executable

783
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,799
memory except for

784
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
short periods of time

785
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,559
so i found that very interesting you

786
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,399
know moving moving to being um sort of

787
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,080
not just stealthed in um by writing only

788
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,159
a memory but it's actually only

789
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,600
sometimes on a memory and most of the

790
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,720
time not

791
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,880
and um there's there's been other things

792
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,120
as well like uh there's this really fast

793
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,360
process migration so you'll have your

794
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,120
code that sort of skips from process to

795
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,480
process to process

796
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
so that any

797
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,320
sort of like any snapshot in time is

798
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,559
unlikely to capture

799
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
your code executing in the process that

800
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,600
you've infected so you know things are

801
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,559
getting

802
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,679
very very interesting there and um

803
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,159
i think it's quite cool

804
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:14,880
i

805
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,200
doubt that it's necessary that that

806
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,799
often um

807
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,760
but

808
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,520
you know i've been impressed that there

809
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,600
is actually like there's advancements

810
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,440
being made that people are doing this

811
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,039
research they're developing new

812
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,640
techniques and they're making it work

813
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,039
and some code for it and i think that's

814
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,880
quite cool

815
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
what about like you know um uh you know

816
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,039
folks moving to actually poison the

817
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,799
source as in you know if you take over

818
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,520
the

819
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
source stream of a product and you can

820
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,960
insert your own stuff into it right you

821
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,919
know what i'm talking about yeah

822
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
yeah like the upstream stuff so yeah

823
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,399
like

824
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,640
i don't know i i tend to think that like

825
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,039
anything that leaves

826
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,799
data behind is bad even if um it's sort

827
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,840
of deeply buried so

828
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,600
uh like again it depends like what

829
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,520
you're trying to do and

830
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
what your risk budget is and so on but

831
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,919
you know personally um

832
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,440
like i find some of those attacks

833
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
interesting you know like you might

834
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,799
remember

835
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
20 20 years ago the linux kernel got

836
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,880
compromised um at the source code level

837
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
from kernel.org

838
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,600
and uh

839
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
i've managed to get the

840
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
the history on that from both sides so i

841
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,240
i've gotten uh a record of what happened

842
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
from the person who did it but i've also

843
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,039
spoken to the um the sysadmins and the

844
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,240
people who are doing security at the

845
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,720
time about how it occurred and it's a

846
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,399
really interesting story and the way

847
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,120
that it got caught is uh like it's pure

848
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,159
chance

849
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
um

850
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,440
basically the the account of one person

851
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
who had hits commit privileges was

852
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,399
compromised so his box was compromised

853
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
and the source code was altered there

854
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,880
and pushed in

855
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,480
but he had uh a bad connection

856
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,039
and some of his pushes had failed okay

857
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,120
so what he did was he had this he had

858
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,600
the script that ran every night it would

859
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,360
download

860
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
a fresh copy from

861
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,039
like kernel.org

862
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
and then it would do an md5 comparison

863
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,600
of his source code right to

864
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,480
this one that was downloaded and to see

865
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
you know like if

866
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
basically if what had been uploaded was

867
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
corrupted from what he had locally

868
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,279
and that's how it was detected was that

869
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
what was uploaded did not match what he

870
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,960
had so

871
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,559
initially it was just like oh okay you

872
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,120
know my my crappy connection you know

873
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,760
caused corrupted files again and then

874
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
you know looking at it he could see the

875
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,720
actual um the actual problems so

876
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
that was quite interesting but like

877
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,960
speaking to the person who did it

878
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,399
for them was like a fun thing they did

879
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,720
really young speaking to the

880
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,200
like speaking to these segments they're

881
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,279
still angry about it like this is 20

882
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,559
years later like um when

883
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
like when i asked one guy he was like oh

884
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
yeah that wasn't like i wasn't around

885
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,320
for that like let me talk to the people

886
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,919
who were there at the time and the one

887
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,159
guy was like that didn't happen

888
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
he only got access to like he only got

889
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,200
access to one account the whole thing

890
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
was fine we had to like rebuild

891
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
everything but it was all clean

892
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,279
okay relax

893
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,760
this was 20 years ago no one

894
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,399
no one's blaming you for getting asked

895
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,399
like

896
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,200
