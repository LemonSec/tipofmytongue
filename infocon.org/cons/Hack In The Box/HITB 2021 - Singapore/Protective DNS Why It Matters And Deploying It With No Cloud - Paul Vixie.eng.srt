1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,280
i've given a

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,120
some of the antecedents of this topic at

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,279
prior hack in the box shows

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,760
i know that some of you who were

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,640
at cyber week in november will recognize

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,880
a couple of the graphics here

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,359
but i promise this is all new

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,400
other than the words we wrap around it

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,720
um

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,320
so

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
everybody complains about the weather

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,200
but in this audience

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
especially these speakers

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
in this conference people are accustomed

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,840
to actually doing something about it

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
and um

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
it's always my pleasure to be with you i

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
wish you could be in person as i uh

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
wished last year

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,879
um so i promise that um

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,760
you know if we uh if we can get together

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,079
i'll be there

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,640
so protective dns has been in the

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,119
headlines this year but it's not a new

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
idea it's uh simply some label

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
engineering applied to a concept that

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
has been floating around for

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
at least a decade in my hands

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
and about another decade before that in

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,479
the hands of others

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
and so what it really means is dns

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,759
that is not true

33
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,759
it's where you ask a question

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
and the answer that you get

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
instead of just depending on where

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,240
akamai thinks you are for content

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
delivery purposes it might actually

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
depend on what your security policy is

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,960
in other words some answers are

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
hard to digest

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
however if you try to digest them you're

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,880
going to discover that they are

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
very uncomfortable for you

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
and so that's the general topic area but

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
i hope to motivate it and motivate you

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
to investigate it further

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,600
and to put some context around it

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
because

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,360
um in the announcements that have come

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,280
about using this new terminology of

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,879
protective dns

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
um

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,040
some important details that have evolved

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
in the last decade or so

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,840
um have been lost and i wish to restore

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,040
those

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
uh we will also have a q a

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
uh where i'll be joined by one of my

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
colleagues from the day job

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
and um

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
that

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
who just texted me hope that's not

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
important um

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
anyway uh

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,640
so please do come to that it's

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
immediately following this hour

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
very well

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
um

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,720
this is what i promised to talk about

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
and what i call your attention to is the

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,879
united states government

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,080
although it's not the government of

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,480
everything it is the world's largest

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
single

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
buyer of i.t

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
products and services and so

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
when they talk the industry who makes

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,599
that kind of thing tends to listen

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
and uh indeed that has happened so

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,840
um

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
what they did is they they came out the

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
department of homeland security and the

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
department of defense came out in

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
march of this year and said

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
yeah you all ought to start using

86
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
protective dns and here ours

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,560
is kind of a list of places that that

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
you could get that from

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
and you know we were jazzed all of us

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,640
who've been in this industry for a long

91
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
time we're just

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,959
um

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,760
but

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,640
it

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,120
turns out they didn't mention us um they

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
didn't mention our approach they made it

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
seem like in order to use protective dns

98
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,239
it was necessary to

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,120
send

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
your dns traffic out into the cloud

101
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,400
and let one of the cloud providers who

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
they named in their announcement

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
be your dns provider

104
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
and you know i guess that some people

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,280
want to do that i don't do that but a

106
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,879
lot of people are pretty comfortable

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
sending all sorts of things to the cloud

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,480
but i don't and we've been doing

109
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,519
something

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,400
that we now call protected dns because

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
that's the new label

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
um for a long time without the cloud

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
and i thought perhaps we should tell the

114
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,759
world

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,919
yeah it's a great idea and if you

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
care about not sending your dns requests

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
into the cloud let us show you how to do

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
that

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,880
but first let's back up a bit

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
um

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
it used to be that the

122
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
set of hosts that were reachable on the

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
internet was so small that you could

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,720
list them all in one file

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
which they did

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
and that file changed so infrequently

127
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,720
that

128
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
you could just download new copy every

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
week and so everyone did and it was

130
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,800
small enough that that was not a problem

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,280
of course that was the pre-commercial

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,919
research kind of research and education

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,880
phase

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
and

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,639
eventually it became obvious that this

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,039
internet thing was going to catch on

137
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,639
and so

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
um

139
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
somebody somewhere said yeah we need a

140
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,840
distributed naming system and there was

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
a bake off and dns won the bake off and

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
that history has been told so i'm going

143
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
to adhere

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
except to say that um

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
as we

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
stand or as i sit today

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,479
uh dns is used for

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
almost all internet activities there's

149
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
one or more dns transactions that has to

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
complete before you can do anything and

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
that includes clicking

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,759
your mouse in your web browser

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,320
so luckily it's so fast that you don't

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,680
notice how many requests are being sent

155
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,479
and there's a fairly deep back office

156
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,720
you don't notice how many other servers

157
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
have to be consulted in order to make

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
your question uh successful

159
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
uh but this is happening you know

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
got to be hundreds of billions uh if not

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
trillions of times per day

162
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
uh by this time and it's not just

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
address lookups originally it was yeah

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
you know i want to telnet somewhere so i

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,639
i've got this name i don't remember the

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,280
address frankly that's

167
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
kind of

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
we remembered the addresses when there

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
were so few of them that you could list

170
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
them in one file you just remembered the

171
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,080
addresses but eventually you know yeah

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
we needed a way to do this and so it was

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
just a way to find the address but now

174
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
it's a got a lot more

175
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
addresses is probably the biggest single

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
thing that still comes from dns but it

177
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
is uh

178
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,160
boy it's uh it's a small part of the

179
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
total by by type

180
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,000
so

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,599
dns is like bgp

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
you have to have it if you're going to

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
reach the things you want to reach

184
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
bgp glues us together

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,440
through the routing system it says how

186
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
you would get a packet from here to

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
there once you have an address

188
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,240
um and so dns is like that except it's

189
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,000
before that it's how do i get the

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
address although of course you have to

191
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
have bgp to reach the dns so it's a bit

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
uh

193
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,400
a bit of a recursive

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,359
dependency there

195
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,240
it's also like netflow in other words if

196
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
you

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,560
are able to see dns then you know what's

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
happening and if you can see the kind of

199
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,919
dns requests that a given population is

200
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,840
making like let's say your customers or

201
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,479
your family your employees

202
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,680
then

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,759
yeah to a first approximation you kind

204
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,280
of know what they're doing you don't

205
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
have to see the traffic if you know what

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,879
names they're looking up i mean i guess

207
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,560
some people want to see the traffic too

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
but this is this is huge

209
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
in terms of just characterizing the

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,639
access to resources

211
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,879
dns is as important as netflow

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
it's also like the spice if you control

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
dns you control the universe

214
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
so there's a lot of interest in

215
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,400
controlling dns

216
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,960
a lot of money to be made if you can

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
sort of force dns to work your way

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
you may have noticed that there's a lot

219
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
of dot this and not that new new generic

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
top-level domains these are

221
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,759
generally a bunch of companies who think

222
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,759
yeah the dot com is very successful i

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,840
want to be like them and so they go pay

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
a lot of money to register a name and

225
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
then it turns out

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,440
com is kind of um hard to duplicate so

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
you it worked once

228
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
but

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
there's a lot more than money at stake

230
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
there's a lot of

231
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
politics a lot of political control

232
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,390
there's a huge problem for

233
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,600
[Music]

234
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
one of the us governments

235
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
a decade or two back when

236
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,279
um dot uh got xxx was allocated and

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,440
everybody assumed that the us government

238
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
had approved it and well no no we didn't

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
or they i wasn't there um

240
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
it's you know it's self-governed the the

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,800
people who are

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
using it and and maintaining it have a

243
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
system and they added.xxx and you know

244
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
please don't blame that on the us

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
government

246
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
um but there were a fair number of

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
people around the world who thought that

248
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
the internet should not have that type

249
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
of sex

250
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,839
quite so visible xxx triple x means uh

251
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,920
pornography generally

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
at least in the u.s so i just want to

253
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,279
say dns is uh is a big deal and um

254
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
it is

255
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
that you could also look in our own

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
space the number of people who think

257
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,519
that they have finally found a use for

258
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
the blockchain and it's replacing dns

259
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
okay great uh let me know how that works

260
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
out because it turns out that as soon as

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
one person thought of it

262
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
99 others also thought of it and so

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,360
they're all fighting for market share um

264
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
the disadvantage of standards is you

265
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
have so many to choose from the

266
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
advantage is that sometimes there is one

267
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,640
that you can just say i'm going to use

268
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,519
that one and dns is that one

269
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,360
um

270
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
so i also want to talk about firewalls

271
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,880
in the early days back in the sort of

272
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,959
pre-commercial era

273
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,120
uh everyone who could reach you and

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,920
everyone you could reach was a

275
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
government contractor

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
um because that's how you got on that

277
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,399
research internet and so

278
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
they were all fairly trustworthy yeah

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
the students sometimes misbehave but

280
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
generally not

281
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
because

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
some sysadmin somewhere would

283
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
disconnect the student and say please

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,320
forgive us we didn't mean to let this

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
guy on

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
um

287
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
but that of course was a bad start

288
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,600
it's like

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
giving birth to a human child with no

290
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
immune system and just putting them in a

291
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
bubble and saying well it's fine they

292
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,959
don't need an immune system because

293
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
there will be no germs

294
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah well eventually they outgrow the

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
bubble and there are germs and there's

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
no immune system and that's kind of

297
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,880
where we are

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,360
and you want to know why we have

299
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
breach fatigue why

300
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
other 100 million uh names and addresses

301
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
and social security numbers got

302
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
released yesterday and probably again

303
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,600
today

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
while i wasn't paying attention and no

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
one cares it's because this stuff is

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
still laboratory great at best

307
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
so hardening was needed but there was no

308
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
way to do it in the early day because we

309
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,079
didn't know what was going to be needed

310
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,320
so eventually when the internet got a

311
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
little bigger firewalls were invented as

312
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,480
well as access control lists and it

313
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,320
turns out you don't want everyone in the

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
world to be able to reach

315
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
whatever services you intend to reach

316
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
sort of within your university or within

317
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,160
your company

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,200
um

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
and yeah that was a revelation that was

320
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,480
news uh traffic encryption you know it's

321
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440
both not possible back with uh

322
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
very expensive very slow cpus but also

323
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,480
not necessary in the early days all of

324
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
this is pretty common today

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
although i am regularly told that i

326
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,880
should just secure my endpoints and then

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,279
my firewall is out of

328
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
out of vogue and that i shouldn't need

329
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
one and you know okay fine you run your

330
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
network the way you want

331
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
and see how far that gets you but you

332
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,000
know i can't secure my endpoints i can't

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
even identify my endpoints so i'm going

334
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
to keep my firewall

335
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,079
and

336
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,560
so this whole thing that we do

337
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,200
where first we rapidly prototype

338
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,279
something and get it working in the lab

339
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
and then deploy it

340
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
and then set our hair on fire

341
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
when we realize the implications of what

342
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,240
we've done

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
is

344
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
that's probably the the hard knuckle

345
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
at the center of internet culture that's

346
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,800
uh that's what got us here and i don't

347
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
think we will ever stop

348
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
and um

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
i i don't love the implications for

350
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
human history that

351
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
this is the information age and this is

352
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
how we're doing it

353
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
but i just want to say that

354
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,240
as far as firewalls are concerned

355
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
a lot of us still have them a lot of us

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,680
still need them certainly all military

357
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
and government and most commercial

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
networks have them

359
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,839
you know i i i don't uh feel that let's

360
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
say amazon and google are prepared to

361
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,040
start buying um

362
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,240
whatever

363
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
conference room video controllers from

364
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,839
each other and allowing them to contact

365
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,680
their mothership with metadata so i

366
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
think there are probably still a lot of

367
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
a lot of firewalls in the world even

368
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
among the people who are telling us we

369
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
don't need them

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
um

371
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
so

372
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
you know if you're getting some pressure

373
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
to give up your firewall then yeah

374
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,199
you're not alone

375
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
so what is protective dns

376
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,639
um

377
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,720
so we want to be able to monitor it

378
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,279
first we want to know what dns is doing

379
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
because it can tell us it can help us

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,760
with detection especially infections of

381
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
which you know there's a new one every

382
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,720
minute and bots and botnets

383
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
um and you know fairly often yeah i'd

384
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
like to secure my endpoints i don't know

385
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,440
which ones to secure oh i'm looking at

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
the dns now i know which ones to secure

387
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
it's the infected ones and the ones that

388
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
are members of botnets thank you dns i'm

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
glad i was able to see that traffic so i

390
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,440
knew

391
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
which endpoints to secure

392
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
you can also filter dns and that may

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
prevent some infections because you

394
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,320
could only get them from certain

395
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
websites or

396
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,800
whatever

397
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680
um and you could block some of the

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,399
botnet command and control data paths in

399
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
other words yeah so the the infection is

400
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,160
there the bot is there but it can't find

401
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
a place to learn who it's supposed to

402
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
ddos for higher and so it's not nearly

403
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
as painful

404
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,600
and you know maybe we'd like it to be

405
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
more painful so you fix it sooner but

406
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
actually that kind of tough love doesn't

407
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,839
work or at least it doesn't scale

408
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
so yeah we like to monitor and filter

409
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,279
our dns

410
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,360
now obviously the user

411
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
and the application and the operating

412
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,160
system

413
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,399
have all got to agree to this

414
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,480
um if they don't they're going to start

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,120
switching over to things like 8.8.8.8

416
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
and there's a whole bunch of other ones

417
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,959
i predict that uh

418
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
all 240

419
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,839
or so

420
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,680
possible uh

421
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,959
n.n.n.n addresses will be dns servers

422
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
probably by

423
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
well let's just pick a date 2025

424
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
because

425
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,920
information is power and dns is where a

426
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,480
lot of that power is and so you can get

427
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
people to send you their dns traffic you

428
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,639
are coming up in the world

429
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,600
but anyway uh what this means is if if

430
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
you plan to monitor dns and filter dns

431
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,880
you have to be doing that in a way that

432
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,680
your users are happy about if if you

433
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,199
want to do things that they don't want

434
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,480
to have done then you're going to see

435
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,240
8.8.8.8 spray painted on the bombed out

436
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
shell of the building

437
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,639
during arab spring and people are just

438
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
going to bypass the servers that aren't

439
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,399
letting them you know reach twitter or

440
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,160
whatever it is

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,920
um there's also something out there

442
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
called dns over https which is

443
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,920
an explicit deliberate bypass of this

444
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,839
type of monitoring and filtering

445
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,680
although i think they had in mind nation

446
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
state monitoring and filtering i didn't

447
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,959
realize

448
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,600
that actually we need this for sort of

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
enterprise security and family filtering

450
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
and everything else

451
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,000
and of course vpns right if people don't

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
like what you're doing with your

453
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
firewall chances are you're going to let

454
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
their their vpn out at least that's what

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,440
works in hotel rooms so i just want to

456
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
say

457
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,120
i am not talking about protective dns as

458
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
a way to do social control i'm talking

459
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
about cooperation where it's adding

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,920
value in the eyes of the people that are

461
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
uh are getting it

462
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
but this is the post-snowden era in 2013

463
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,119
a us defense contractor flew to hong

464
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,280
kong and made a lot of disclosures and

465
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,160
that

466
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
caused

467
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,359
a lot of the world to suddenly realize

468
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,400
that

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,599
the world's an ugly place full of

470
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
people that want to do bad things to

471
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
each other and especially governments

472
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,400
who are in the dirty tricks business

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
um the people who kind of already knew

474
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
that said well you know i guess this was

475
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
bad

476
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,919
but we didn't set our hair on fire but a

477
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
lot of people for whom this was news

478
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,120
said i don't want to live in a world

479
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,039
that works that way i wanted a different

480
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,559
world and so now we're seeing a lot of

481
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,679
knee-jerk

482
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
technology responses to those events i

483
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
mentioned dns over http

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
and that is just a way to make your dns

485
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,280
live inside of

486
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,480
https or http 2 or http 3 or whatever

487
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,520
you're using

488
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,400
and therefore become indistinguishable

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,799
from a whole bunch of other traffic

490
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
but of course it's been possible to

491
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
distinguish web traffic

492
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
uh because of the way tls worked uh you

493
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,960
could see some of the metadata and so

494
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,760
now we have encrypted client hello you

495
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
may have heard of it as encrypted server

496
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,400
name indication or esni

497
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,960
that wasn't enough turns out they

498
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,760
they went back and said let's not just

499
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
encrypt that let's encrypt the whole

500
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
hello

501
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
uh that will make it impossible

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
for a next-gen firewall to be able to

503
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,520
say okay this uh outbound web request

504
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,919
from some desktop of some employee of

505
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,799
this mega corporation

506
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
either does or does not conform to

507
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,720
corporate security policy

508
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
uh where they might say hey i wonder if

509
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
this is something only a botnet would do

510
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
or you know what what have you that's

511
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,880
gonna be impossible soon

512
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,960
because all of the information that you

513
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
need in order to intercept those

514
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
sessions is being encrypted and

515
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
and so

516
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,039
we're going to see

517
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
the use of forced proxy soon

518
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
where every device in that

519
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
big corporate network is going to have

520
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,840
to agree

521
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
to accept a key from probably some

522
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
private key provider that is the company

523
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,200
itself i know well a lot of companies

524
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,160
have that

525
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
and they're going to say look you got to

526
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,679
use the proxy and

527
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,120
here's the name of the proxy and here's

528
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
the key it's going to give you

529
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
and if you don't use the proxy you're

530
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
not going to be able to get outside the

531
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,400
company because we have to be able to

532
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
have corporate security controls

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
and this is as natural as uh day

534
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
following night

535
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
and and it's not something you can

536
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,080
legislate away it's not something you

537
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
can create standards away and it's not

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,120
something you can

539
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,360
sort of change how everybody's laptop

540
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
and smartphone works and suddenly you

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
know not need that or

542
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
start living in a world where big

543
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
companies don't insist on it

544
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,799
we're also going to see something called

545
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,600
quick i forget what it stands for but it

546
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,039
will replace the tcp protocol with udp

547
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
and it will have

548
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
as perfect

549
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
as possible

550
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
an entropy

551
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,640
level which means you will not be able

552
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
to tell

553
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,240
what something is unless you are the

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
person who sent it or you have

555
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
negotiated very carefully with the

556
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
person who sent it because you are the

557
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
person receiving it

558
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,039
and everybody in the middle is just

559
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
going to see white noise

560
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
um just total uh random like

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,000
indistinguishable from randomness

562
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
and

563
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
um that's going to be very hard for our

564
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,960
industry

565
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
because we are used to being able to

566
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
intercept let's say a connect request

567
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,480
because that would normally go to the

568
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,360
kernel

569
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
windows or mac os or a smartphone or

570
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
whatever the app would have to say i

571
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,039
want to have a connection to a place

572
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,640
here's the address please let me know

573
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
when you have it

574
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
and then you could intercept that you

575
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
could say do i approve of this do i not

576
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,919
do i want to log it do i want it my

577
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
audit trail

578
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
and you know if it's a torture chamber

579
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
for captured malware then you absolutely

580
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
want to know when it's doing that and uh

581
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,440
now none of that's going to happen it

582
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
won't be a system call anymore there

583
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
will be no way

584
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,200
for

585
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
any endpoint security software or any

586
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
endpoint threat researcher to know

587
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
what the heck is going on in there

588
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,679
um so the the implications of this are

589
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,520
probably more apparent to you listening

590
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
to me than they have been

591
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,039
to the people who have created these

592
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,120
because the folks that are creating them

593
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,679
are just very good at creating protocols

594
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,679
they don't also have to secure anything

595
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,200
so they just don't know the implications

596
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,679
i have tried to explain it to some of

597
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,039
them

598
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,120
and they tell me that um i don't need a

599
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
firewall anymore um

600
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,039
so it's just uh

601
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,320
i don't think we're gonna have a meeting

602
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,600
of the mines there

603
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
but what this all means is that um

604
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
you know

605
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,840
these endpoints and

606
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
applications our kernels our libraries

607
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
our operating systems our users none of

608
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,480
them

609
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,799
are trustworthy none of them should be

610
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,520
allowed to communicate without

611
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,799
having to

612
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
declare their intentions and get some

613
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
kind of oversight

614
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
but that is not what people believe in

615
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,679
the post snowden era the people that are

616
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
creating all these protocols

617
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,480
and by the way the folks at um

618
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,360
apple and google and microsoft who bring

619
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
us most of our endpoints are well

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,919
represented in that community so

621
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
one expects that their companies are

622
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,080
going to implement all of this

623
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
but that just means in the old days now

624
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,080
the internet came later first we had

625
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,760
networks and then we had the internet

626
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
which was a network of networks

627
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
um and what that meant was the network

628
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,360
was the

629
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,000
atomic

630
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
element of autonomy it was the thing

631
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
that you could control it was the thing

632
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,640
that you had to control you would be

633
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,880
responsible for whatever your network

634
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,280
did you couldn't say i'm sorry i'm

635
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,720
ddosing you i uh i i don't know

636
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,240
anything about what's going on with my

637
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
endpoints no no if you were ddossing

638
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,000
somebody you had to stop

639
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,640
and um and that was the network of

640
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
networks now we have the web which is a

641
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,799
network of eyeballs and the networks are

642
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
seen as um

643
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,840
irrelevant or sort of a meaningless

644
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,799
abstraction or in any case they're

645
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,799
inconvenient so um

646
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,480
you know this is uh this is the

647
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,919
post-snowden era

648
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,200
and um

649
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
to secure networks the way that we used

650
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
to do

651
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,559
uh all of this new stuff is gonna have

652
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,600
to get blocked which is being made

653
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
intentionally very difficult because if

654
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
a company can do it then a nation state

655
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,240
can do it and the nation states i think

656
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
are the actual target of all this

657
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,159
ambition

658
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,200
so

659
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
um that's sort of what brings us here

660
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
uh to where protective dns is uh

661
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,679
something that the

662
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,440
us government is recommending everybody

663
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
do and that a lot of us have been doing

664
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,760
it for one to two decades now um

665
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
so

666
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,919
you know if

667
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,520
if if the

668
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
app isn't bypassing it or the library or

669
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,880
the operating system or the user isn't

670
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
bypassing it through protected dns is

671
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
very powerful security tool

672
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,000
um

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,960
and

674
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
you know that's because everything you

675
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,600
can

676
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
nothing which can be abused won't be and

677
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,960
it turns out everything can be abused

678
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,600
your user might be an intruder or just

679
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,679
untrained and doing something

680
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,679
that is unwise or they could be a

681
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
malicious insider trying to you know

682
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,240
steal all your source code for the you

683
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,840
know uh whatever go over to a competitor

684
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,080
there's a lot of terrible things that

685
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
can go on there

686
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
um

687
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
so any kind of monitoring or control

688
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,600
that isn't blocked can help security

689
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,039
and i do want to note that

690
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
we read in the headlines about dns

691
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
failing and you know all of a sudden

692
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,919
some big e-commerce giant being off the

693
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,640
net because some dns failure happened

694
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
somewhere and that makes it sound like

695
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,159
dns is flaky and horrible

696
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
and it's not the ns does trillions of

697
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,600
things right every day

698
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
um and it actually it works too well um

699
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
we have to break it we have to be able

700
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,320
to

701
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
uh keep the people who want to hurt us

702
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
from using this cooperative system to do

703
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
it

704
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,600
so this is a picture i showed you all

705
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,679
during cyber week in november

706
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,720
and it's just this is the dns topology

707
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,559
questions come into the bottom

708
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,120
uh usually from your web browser when

709
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,559
you click on a link

710
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,440
um or you know maybe from your shell app

711
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
if you say i wanna ssh somewhere then

712
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,760
that's gonna cause a dns question

713
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
that'll go off to the stub resolver

714
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,679
that's part of that particular

715
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,919
operating system so that smartphone that

716
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,720
laptop that virtual server that real

717
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,799
server that router whatever it is it's

718
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,200
got a stub resolver and it is configured

719
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
to send your questions

720
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,279
on your behalf to

721
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,559
this thing in the middle it's called a

722
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,880
full resolver or sometimes a recursive

723
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,919
server

724
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
and that thing that is the nightmare of

725
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
complexity that is where all dns bugs

726
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,039
are

727
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,120
um maybe well maybe only

728
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,720
99.999 percent there may be a few bugs

729
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,279
elsewhere but this is where

730
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,039
all of the really

731
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,159
the the the stuff that has kept me up

732
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,480
at night over the last couple of decades

733
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
has been there

734
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
um so if your stub resolver asks that

735
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,240
thing which is shared usually by

736
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,720
everybody else that's on on your wi-fi

737
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
or on your your network

738
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,159
um

739
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,080
if somebody else has already asked that

740
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,760
then you know

741
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,679
it's cash you'll get a copy of what they

742
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,600
got and you'll get a very fast answer if

743
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,480
not it's got to go hunting it and so to

744
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
do that it's got to go up to those

745
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
authority servers on the top and that's

746
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,320
where the answers enter the system

747
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,760
normally in a text file

748
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,559
that looks like an old pdp 10 assembly

749
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,320
listing because that's what the inventor

750
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,000
of dns had as his example

751
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
and

752
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
you know it could be a database if it's

753
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,039
akamai or some other content delivery

754
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,600
network it's not even data it's it's uh

755
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,760
it's a program that's answering these

756
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
questions but one way or another the

757
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
questions come in at the bottom answers

758
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
come in at the top they meet in the

759
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,520
middle

760
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,120
and you see this firewall that i've

761
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,440
drawn here this uh this line that just

762
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
says you know i the sysadmin

763
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
really want to force everybody inside my

764
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,640
network to use that recursive server i

765
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
don't want them to use 8.8 you know if

766
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
they do i want it to fail

767
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
uh because i want to be able to

768
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,799
you know answer their questions if they

769
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,399
come to me and say the internet's down i

770
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,760
want to know

771
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
i want to be able to help them

772
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,399
um

773
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,760
and

774
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,600
that's kind of the way it used to be

775
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
i'm going to be describing some things

776
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
today that are over on the right where

777
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,159
we can now

778
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,440
observe and analyze and we can also have

779
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,360
response policy and there are some

780
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
standard middleware protocols for that

781
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
now that i'll give you the urls for at

782
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,520
the end

783
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,200
you see that thing on the end that's

784
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
applications doing their own dns by

785
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
speaking this dns over http protocol

786
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,559
bypassing your server ignoring your

787
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,480
firewall and so on

788
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,919
so that's this is kind of the more

789
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,640
modern view

790
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
and

791
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,679
oh wow talk title speaker name here

792
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
sorry

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
um

794
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
right got to finish these slides before

795
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
i show them to you

796
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,399
so um

797
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,640
let me just say

798
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
we have to be able to do takedown we the

799
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,919
productive side of the world economy who

800
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,880
have who builds the things creates the

801
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
assets that are that the unproductive

802
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
side wants to steal instead of working

803
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,559
for a living

804
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,480
we are going to have to cooperate and we

805
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,159
are going to have to self-defend it is

806
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
very clear that we cannot count

807
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
on the secret world government of the

808
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
united nations to somehow go out

809
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
uh to the far end where there is some

810
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,399
isp who doesn't care if we are hurt who

811
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,320
is selling services to someone's hurting

812
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,919
us

813
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,320
and you know we complain and they just

814
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,799
ignore it because why would they care

815
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,039
take down at the far end won't work

816
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,880
take down at the near end which is to

817
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,240
say every one of us doing it for

818
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,840
ourselves that won't scale

819
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
you know i used to spend a lot of time

820
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
fighting spam and doing a lot of threat

821
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
research in that that area

822
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
and um

823
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,200
it

824
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,279
takes a lot out of you and you don't get

825
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,240
much done this really requires uh

826
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,760
specialization you're going to have

827
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
specialization of knowledge and tools

828
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,279
and you've got to have a tension you've

829
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,679
got to have the time to focus on threat

830
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:02,880
research

831
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,840
um

832
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,320
and not every endpoint that wants to

833
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,600
protect themselves is going to be able

834
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
to do that

835
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,640
so protective dns can be seen as take

836
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
down in the middle it's not at the far

837
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,000
end it's not at the near end it's in the

838
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,880
middle

839
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
because that's where it is actually

840
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
possible to do something

841
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
if a bunch of people want to cooperate

842
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
to get that thing done right the people

843
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,399
who don't cooperate won't be affected by

844
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
it they can they can still do whatever

845
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,360
it is

846
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,559
and uh

847
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,320
you know that's the libertarian spirit

848
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,559
of the internet no one can stop you from

849
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
doing what you want but they may be able

850
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,639
to stop you from doing it to them

851
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,799
so

852
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
in the dod announcement what they said

853
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,960
is here's a bunch of cloud-based dns

854
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
providers that offer filtering or

855
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
protective dns and you should

856
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
you know use one or use something else

857
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,600
that's like this but here are the ones

858
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
that we know about

859
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,440
and i when i saw that i thought you know

860
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,279
that's good i know a lot of people want

861
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,120
to put their dns out in the cloud but i

862
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,159
don't and my customers don't and a lot

863
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,440
of my friends

864
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
don't um

865
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
that's why we have a totally different

866
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
way to do what you're now calling

867
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,159
protected dns that does not rely on

868
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,679
using the cloud

869
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,120
i thought it sure would have been nice

870
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
that somebody from the dod had contacted

871
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,960
us and said

872
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
what's this rpz thing uh you know we're

873
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,279
putting out an announcement you know

874
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,880
what do we what do we say to people who

875
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
don't want to use the cloud for their

876
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
dns i could have told them

877
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
i could have pointed the

878
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,240
website they could have told them google

879
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
could have told them

880
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,720
anyway

881
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
um protective dns is something that a

882
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,559
lot of users a lot of families a lot of

883
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,480
companies want

884
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
if you don't want it you're not going to

885
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,080
get it you're going to use a vpn you're

886
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
going to use whatever it takes that you

887
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
don't get protective dns so please do

888
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,159
not think i'm trying to ram this down

889
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,919
anybody's throat i just want to say if

890
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,279
you do want it

891
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
you ought to be able to get it

892
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,799
and if you're not going to trust the

893
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,039
cloud with your dns requests either

894
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,279
because you don't don't want those to be

895
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,120
seen or you don't want the external

896
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,679
dependency whatever that is

897
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,760
you have choices

898
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,200
and

899
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
the choice i know about is the one that

900
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
i helped invent it's called

901
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,080
rpz it's a dns firewall

902
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,320
and i'm going to spend a lot of the rest

903
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
of our time together explaining sort of

904
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,720
what that is and how it applies to this

905
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,159
situation

906
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,320
and then in the q a which will follow

907
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,799
this i will um

908
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,399
participate in some demos and uh answer

909
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
more technical questions

910
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,240
um and we've also just released a video

911
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,159
for those who are not going to attend

912
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,760
the q a

913
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
so that's on the farsight

914
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,559
first site security section of youtube

915
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,559
i'll give you the url on the last slide

916
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,360
so

917
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,080
dns firewalls were created at a time

918
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,559
that a lot of us were still running our

919
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,039
own name servers um

920
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,000
and

921
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
so it made sense to add the monitoring

922
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,960
and filtering that we needed in dns to

923
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
the dns servers that we were running

924
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
and um since we had been through this

925
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,720
once before by adding ip firewalls we

926
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,279
knew that an ipv4 a dns firewall which

927
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,039
had to be configured

928
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,880
with these 10

929
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
things um

930
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
was never going to work it would never

931
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,480
scale it had to be able to subscribe to

932
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,360
a

933
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,320
firewall policy feed it had to be able

934
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,120
to be federated it had to have

935
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,399
automation

936
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,519
and so

937
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,320
when we built rpz we did it on a publish

938
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,919
subscribe model

939
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,120
it is

940
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,320
possible and i do it but it is possible

941
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,640
but it is very difficult to

942
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,640
reconfigure the policy of a dns firewall

943
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
with these

944
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,320
um you just don't walk up to a dns

945
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
server and say i want you i want you to

946
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,159
start blocking something it's much

947
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,000
easier to get something from far away

948
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,600
than it is to provide it directly and

949
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,799
that's

950
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,759
that's necessary

951
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
and i want to say again not all dns

952
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,480
server operators can afford to do their

953
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
own threat research

954
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
and

955
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,040
you know no matter how much they could

956
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,119
afford to do it wouldn't be enough we

957
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,359
have to have aggregation we have to have

958
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,239
specialization of labor we have to have

959
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,918
competition we have to have companies

960
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,320
out there that are saying i want to be

961
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,119
your dns policy provider i have

962
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,040
something i'm publishing you could

963
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,320
subscribe

964
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
and then the next company will say oh no

965
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,879
no take me take me i'm better or maybe

966
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,560
you take them both that's how that works

967
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,320
too

968
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
that is necessary this is never going to

969
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,239
take off if we don't make sure that

970
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
nobody has to do their own threat

971
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,119
research unless they're in the threat

972
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
research business or it's their hobby as

973
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,599
i know it is for many of you

974
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
so the firewall protocols for dns are

975
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
dns tap for monitoring and dns rpz for

976
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,119
control

977
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
and i won't be talking more about the ns

978
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
tap today but i will give you a url at

979
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,920
the end

980
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,480
it's really cool you should certainly

981
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,599
look at what your dns servers are doing

982
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,040
and start

983
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,880
either writing scripts or finding open

984
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,200
source software that will parse that for

985
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
you and tell you what it means

986
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,359
so

987
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,240
vernon shriver and i worked at isc when

988
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,440
all this was going on that's the

989
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,359
internet systems consortium the home of

990
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,079
bind also the home of f root and some

991
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
other fine things

992
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
they have a very nice dhcp server as

993
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,119
well

994
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,040
and since bind is what we had that's

995
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,720
where we did the prototype

996
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
and you know it's the usual kind of

997
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,240
thing

998
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,079
what what how should it work oh i don't

999
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,839
know let's try this oh that worked okay

1000
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,200
let's uh

1001
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,920
let's let's make that imperturbable for

1002
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,359
all eternity even though we're going to

1003
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
wish we had put more thought into it

1004
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,680
well sorry about that that happened

1005
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,560
but in the years since then uh rpz has

1006
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,480
stabilized uh it's it's uh but not in

1007
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
any sense the word abandonware it's uh

1008
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,240
somewhat mature and it's everywhere

1009
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
there's no open source name server you

1010
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,960
could want to deploy that won't have rpz

1011
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,079
support

1012
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,040
and i really want to thank my colleagues

1013
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,520
at the uh companies who make these uh

1014
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,800
unbound uh cannot which comes from cz

1015
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,920
nick in prague power dns comes from uh

1016
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,160
amsterdam or no not amsterdam uh

1017
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,119
somewhere else in netherlands um

1018
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,640
and you know

1019
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,320
everybody kind of looked at this first

1020
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
and said uh i don't know you know why i

1021
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,640
need that but a few years later

1022
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,839
everybody knew

1023
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,560
we had to have this and um

1024
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,200
and it's cool to just watch this go and

1025
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
it's not an ietf standard this did not

1026
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
come from the same people that are

1027
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
bringing us quick

1028
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,690
and

1029
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,680
[Music]

1030
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,560
dns over http and so forth so there is

1031
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,880
an rfc draft and we do revise it

1032
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
periodically to clarify it and keep it

1033
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,280
up to date and yes i'm under some

1034
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,040
pressure to finish it and let it be

1035
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,119
published and i really should do that

1036
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,520
but i've been busy with my day job

1037
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,839
um and every dns appliance that you

1038
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,280
might buy so especially from blue cat or

1039
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,440
infoblox

1040
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
they all support rpz and they will also

1041
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
try to sell you services they have rpgs

1042
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,240
of their own

1043
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,680
because hey

1044
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
using dns to deliver security is a

1045
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,800
pretty cool business model so um

1046
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,520
yeah this is uh this is out there and um

1047
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,280
if you didn't know about it i'm glad to

1048
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
be telling you if you did know about it

1049
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,960
but you thought it didn't apply to you

1050
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
i'm telling you it does

1051
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
and here are the implications here's why

1052
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
it applies to you

1053
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,359
so there are a bunch of available rpg

1054
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,040
feeds they're mostly not free

1055
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,960
we'd like to see more free content but

1056
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,720
it turns out giving stuff away is a

1057
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,359
thankless thing i learned that from

1058
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,880
decades of uh getting bind away that's

1059
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
why one of the reasons that i decided my

1060
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,640
time at isc would be over in 2013 is

1061
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,520
that i got tired of giving stuff away

1062
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,680
and having people complain about it

1063
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,599
so that's probably why there isn't more

1064
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,760
free content but hey you're within the

1065
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,160
sound of my voice if you've got ambition

1066
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,119
go create a free feed and i will test it

1067
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,599
for you i will put it on my social feed

1068
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,599
i'll i'll do everything i can to help

1069
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,280
you succeed

1070
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,520
but i recommend you adopt a freemium

1071
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,119
business model so that people who want

1072
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,880
to use it commercially have a way to pay

1073
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,760
you

1074
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,599
um that'll be important to them and you

1075
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,280
and me

1076
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
because i want you to succeed

1077
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,320
so the updates to an rpz

1078
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
are streamed um

1079
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,119
and they stream continuously

1080
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,920
so in my day job we have one that

1081
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
changes every second and indeed we send

1082
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,040
a few packets to every one of our

1083
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,280
subscribers every second

1084
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,000
and it works it just keeps up

1085
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,839
so it's like you pour the data in one

1086
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,280
side and gravity just takes it where

1087
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,480
it's going

1088
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,839
um

1089
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,960
and we use tcig to control subscriptions

1090
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,119
and also to verify the identity of the

1091
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,960
far side and so it's a relatively secure

1092
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
protocol um certainly it's uh it's not

1093
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
encrypted

1094
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
uh because we don't think of dns as

1095
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
secret maybe dana's policy should be a

1096
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,760
secret man

1097
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,280
we'll think about that

1098
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,720
later

1099
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,119
and so any thread research team anywhere

1100
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,359
can publish their own results

1101
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,800
in this format

1102
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,240
and we want

1103
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,560
when vernon and i created this in 2010

1104
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,760
we wanted to enable a services market of

1105
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,079
unconstrained size an unlimited number

1106
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,320
of producers and consumers

1107
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,359
and

1108
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,240
indeed i expect that some of the cloud

1109
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
operators who are

1110
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,520
offering protective dns are using rpz in

1111
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,440
their own back office systems because

1112
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,560
why wouldn't you it works

1113
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,680
but when we did this we kind of thought

1114
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,400
this would be more of a family filtering

1115
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,599
corporate filtering military government

1116
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,280
kind of filtering

1117
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
market

1118
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,079
okay

1119
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,839
um

1120
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,079
so i mentioned that in my day job we

1121
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,920
have an rpz

1122
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,240
a series of them actually that we call

1123
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,880
newly observed and these are just fresh

1124
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,720
domain names when we first see one and

1125
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,880
we have a big network we see a lot

1126
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,520
nobody sees everything not even 8.8 sees

1127
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,319
everything but you see a lot so if we

1128
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,880
see it as probably new and so every time

1129
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,040
we see it we just put it into

1130
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,400
the rpcs

1131
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,040
and uh customers get to decide which one

1132
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,960
they want it could be the 10 minute one

1133
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,000
the

1134
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,079
one hour one the 24 hour one's a bunch

1135
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,520
of different ones because everybody

1136
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,319
defines new differently right so we know

1137
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,760
it's new when we first see it we don't

1138
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
know how long it stays new that's that's

1139
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,760
in the eye of the beholder in the eye of

1140
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,359
the subscriber

1141
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,839
um but it turns out that breaking name

1142
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,200
resolution for fresh domains for domains

1143
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
that are still too fresh works right

1144
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,160
i've been blocking spam longer than

1145
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,119
probably anybody and um

1146
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,640
i block a lot but when i added this to

1147
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,240
the name server that feeds my mail

1148
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,560
server i blocked more spam

1149
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
because you can't send email here unless

1150
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,680
every domain name in the smtp envelope

1151
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
resolves and it turns out a lot of them

1152
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,800
won't if you won't let fresh domains

1153
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,359
resolve so that's an example of the kind

1154
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,119
of power you can get from something that

1155
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,960
has no machine learning

1156
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,720
no artificial intelligence nothing just

1157
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,160
you know

1158
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,359
gasoline oxygen and flame you know

1159
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
and you know yeah my team is busy

1160
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
with a lot of other things that we want

1161
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,599
to do in the rpg space but a lot of

1162
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
teams are very busy with that and i love

1163
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,720
that

1164
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,760
um there's no patent on any of this

1165
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,920
you don't need a license you don't pay a

1166
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,359
royalty you just open up you you can

1167
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,319
implement it in your name server without

1168
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,000
permission you can

1169
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,079
publish without permission you can

1170
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,640
subscribe without permission it is

1171
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,119
sort of just a complete bizarre

1172
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,800
and uh it's been great um

1173
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,240
and so

1174
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,920
sort of there's a reason i'm telling you

1175
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,000
this um

1176
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
because some of this i told you last

1177
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,119
year

1178
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,319
um

1179
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,800
there's a project out there called ioc

1180
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,240
to rpz

1181
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,319
and uh they are

1182
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,520
clearly

1183
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,560
aware that rpg would be more meaningful

1184
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,319
if there was more content for it and so

1185
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,280
they are

1186
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,839
working hard to try to get more things

1187
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,359
published in this format and they're

1188
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,200
publishing some of their own and they

1189
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,340
have a um

1190
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,720
[Music]

1191
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,760
a raspberry pi image that they make

1192
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,040
available

1193
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,480
for people who want to use this who

1194
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,040
don't have their own name server and

1195
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,800
so that's very cool because and we have

1196
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,040
also we've worked the pi hole project

1197
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,640
inside my day job

1198
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,280
to add our pz there

1199
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,200
and the reason is i think we're going to

1200
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,839
see a massive expansion of the set of

1201
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,240
people who want to run their own dns

1202
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,880
uh they don't want to use the cloud uh

1203
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
they want to have control over what kind

1204
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,480
of filtering they're getting

1205
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,280
they

1206
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,880
and they want to control who their

1207
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,400
security providers are and what the

1208
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,760
policies are

1209
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,880
um

1210
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,720
and you know threat stop has had

1211
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,280
personal dns which is kind of like rpz

1212
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,680
for windows for years now and um

1213
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,520
i'm expecting

1214
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,160
now that uh department of defense has

1215
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,920
said yeah you all need this protective

1216
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
dns thing

1217
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,680
that um

1218
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,280
we're gonna see this take off finally

1219
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,839
it's going to be a lot of people who say

1220
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,880
yes protective dns can be very useful i

1221
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,920
want it

1222
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,800
i don't plan to bypass it therefore it's

1223
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,280
not irrelevant to me so i'm going gonna

1224
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,960
install it and i'm gonna start

1225
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,560
controlling um what dns resolutions i

1226
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,640
have a hard fail for

1227
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,520
now

1228
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,079
you know i should mention i i didn't

1229
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,240
wanna

1230
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,520
kill you with powerpoint so i'm not

1231
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,359
not every one of these details is here

1232
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,720
but it is

1233
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,599
here

1234
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,240
every detail you need to understand

1235
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,720
about what i've told you is

1236
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,599
at one or more of these websites

1237
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,440
and uh

1238
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,000
for rpz you know what i've mentioned is

1239
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,359
newly observed

1240
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,079
uh domain names and that's that's an rpg

1241
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,560
that we that we make at my day job

1242
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,280
but that's only one example you could

1243
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,480
also have a rule in a response policy

1244
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,079
zone that said you know there is uh

1245
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,040
there's an isp and it's in i don't know

1246
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,240
some country

1247
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,440
and uh there it's run by criminals

1248
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,640
and uh ripe or aaron or you know some

1249
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,200
address allocator has been handing out

1250
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,800
address space to them because they don't

1251
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
know they're a criminal and they keep

1252
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,920
coming back

1253
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,160
you know every week or every month and

1254
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,119
getting more address space and um and

1255
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,960
they just burn through it they just they

1256
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
they use it badly and it gets added to

1257
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,800
spam house and all the other

1258
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
real-time black hole lists um which

1259
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,839
something else i invented

1260
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,359
co-invented um

1261
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
and uh and then they get more

1262
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,440
address-based and and so what you could

1263
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,880
do with rpg is you could say look

1264
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,800
there's a slash 19 that was just given

1265
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
out to one of those isps

1266
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,560
and uh i want it to be that any ad any

1267
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,200
dns answer no matter what the question

1268
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,359
was if the answer contains an address

1269
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,720
that's in that slash 19 address block

1270
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,760
fail

1271
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,560
and

1272
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
then there are other things as well i'm

1273
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,760
not going to go through the whole thing

1274
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,800
you could find that at dns rpg on info

1275
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
but i'll give you another example of

1276
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,280
what you might do as failure

1277
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,880
because the example that i've given is

1278
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,319
well it just doesn't work pretend it

1279
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,640
doesn't exist and you can do that that

1280
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,280
tends to make the uh the web app give up

1281
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,720
and you know

1282
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,400
display an error page

1283
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,640
but um you don't have to you could

1284
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,640
return a cname which is a dns alias it's

1285
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,920
like a symbolic link in a file system um

1286
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,480
therefore you could get that website to

1287
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,640
say oh well i was looking for this name

1288
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,800
but i got back from dns an indication

1289
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,440
that that's not the true name that's uh

1290
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,280
that's an alias and that the true name

1291
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,680
the canonical name the c name is this

1292
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
other thing so i'm going to restart my

1293
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,400
query there and it restarts that query

1294
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,440
and that

1295
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
that name will be the address of some

1296
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,800
server inside your security operations

1297
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,680
center

1298
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,920
and so they'll get the address of that

1299
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,960
and they'll

1300
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,040
fetch the web page from that display it

1301
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,800
and all of a sudden the user who clicked

1302
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,440
on the thing that was dangerous will get

1303
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,359
a warning page hey you clicked on

1304
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,200
something dangerous

1305
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,920
and we we prevented you from reaching it

1306
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,599
this is what you clicked on

1307
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,640
um

1308
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,880
and this by the way is the next time

1309
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,160
that uh

1310
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,400
i.t security training will be given in

1311
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,640
your area uh i don't know what you would

1312
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,720
do with that sort of capability but

1313
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,400
that's an example of how

1314
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,319
some universities

1315
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,160
have used it and i know lawrence

1316
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,559
berkeley labs uses it that way

1317
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,640
so there's a lot you can do

1318
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,520
if you can constructively lie

1319
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,839
about

1320
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,400
dns and when i say constructively i also

1321
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
mean cooperatively right if you're

1322
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,000
coming in late you think that i'm

1323
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,400
offering this as a way to institute

1324
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,640
social control from an authoritarian

1325
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
government i don't

1326
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,880
because any such thing will be bypassed

1327
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,359
um so this really is a feature for those

1328
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,640
who want it

1329
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,800
and what i want is that if i

1330
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,000
you know i'm

1331
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,839
mindless and i'm clicking around on the

1332
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,079
web someday and i end up clicking on

1333
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,000
something that could hurt me according

1334
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,960
to some security provider whose policies

1335
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,000
i know

1336
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,960
and whose services i chose i can get

1337
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,160
that information delivered to me in dns

1338
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,040
form

1339
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,760
and i can do that without having to use

1340
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,200
opendns

1341
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,240
or any of the other cloud-based dns

1342
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,520
services

1343
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,240
that mostly all do filtering of one kind

1344
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
or another you just don't necessarily

1345
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,359
know what it is and if you don't like it

1346
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,200
you probably can't make very many

1347
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,359
choices about changing it

1348
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,040
and if it changes then you probably

1349
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,559
don't have a good way of finding out its

1350
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,160
change so there's a lot of reasons why

1351
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,839
you might want to have very close

1352
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
control over this

1353
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,760
um or you might not you might say yeah

1354
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,480
open dns is fine cloudflare is fine quad

1355
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,280
9 is fine whatever all these these cloud

1356
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,720
providers and they can offer you

1357
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,359
filtering and you can study it to find

1358
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
out how it's going to behave it's

1359
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,720
they're they're good companies there's

1360
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,599
nothing

1361
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,760
uh nefarious about what any of them are

1362
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
doing it's just not for me it might not

1363
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,079
be for you

1364
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,359
