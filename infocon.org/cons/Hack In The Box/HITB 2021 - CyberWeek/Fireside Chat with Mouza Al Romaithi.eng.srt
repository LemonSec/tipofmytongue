had a conversation earlier about just

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,760
getting to know each other and

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
what i found is there's so many points

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,040
of resonance

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,759
today my name is mozar methi i'm

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,400
director of cyber security i've been in

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,280
this role fairly recently actually i've

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,680
joined adq in in may

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
uh prior to that i've worked in the

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
cyber security realm for over 13 years

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
a mix actually between it and cyber

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,720
security so i started my career actually

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,119
in the it field and then moved to

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
specialize in cyber security especially

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
after i got my master's degree okay and

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
from there i did not

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
did not change the the field that i'm in

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,560
um

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,799
i enjoy it i have so much passion for

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
that and i mean it when i say i have so

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,639
much passion in such a way that um

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
i i don't only say that you need we need

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
to practice uh cybersecurity i also

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,599
practice it myself

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,480
and try to get my hands on experience on

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
a lot of areas so i mean the realm of

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
cyber security is is huge right yes and

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,440
it's not about just well compliance is

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
one part of it but then there are there

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
are fun aspects of part of it i'm not

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,840
saying compliance is not but i'm saying

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
that there are also other aspects of it

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,959
like

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,200
penetration testing you know malware

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,160
analysis if you're into that uh

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,519
you know working with the different

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
security solutions there's tons of

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
things that you really can there's a

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
huge opportunity to learn and grow in

74
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,160
that area yes indeed

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,840
what got you excited about cyber

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,959
security

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,680
in your career right so um

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
i think the

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
shift happened when i entered the master

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,720
program of cyber security that's when i

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,319
discovered that

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,040
yes this is what i want to do okay and

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
uh i'm glad i was in certain an

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
organization so at that point i was in

85
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
emirates identity authority

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
and at that point uh the the

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
organization actually supported me and

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
moved me from

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,640
i.t

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
job and moved me to the cyber security

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
role right and from there i was like yes

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,319
this is where i'm supposed to be and

93
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
this is where i've been ever since

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
so initially when i we started we

95
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
started with the iso 27000

96
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,080
implementation so i went into the

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,319
compliance training i went into the

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,159
audit part of it

99
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,040
uh and uh we

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
we pretty much uh we're focusing on risk

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
management that sort of thing

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,640
later on in in my career i shifted more

103
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
into the technical aspect of it

104
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,360
uh and that's where i found out that i

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
really enjoy uh

106
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
conducting penetration testing and i

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,400
would in my own time practice it at home

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
not a lab but a mini lab that i i have

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
at home that where i can

110
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
you know practice and uh try out

111
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
different tools there there's tons of

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
open source solutions that you can try

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,320
and you know play around with and it's

114
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,160
an excellent learning opportunity and

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,560
that's how i how that helped build up my

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
skill set that area

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
you're true you're a true hacker at

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,759
heart actually

119
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
and the uh the term hacker somehow took

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,759
a very wrong turn in mainstream media

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
but it's it's not about you know doing

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
bad things it's about essentially

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
thinking out of the box right and

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
making things do stuff that they were

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
not supposed to do

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,680
like

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
i'll give an example in rural india

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
there's one region of rural india which

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
purchases the most number of washing

130
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
machines this is farmland

131
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
so the the whirlpool decided like hey

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
why are these guys buying the most

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,440
number of washing machines and they're

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,039
not selling in cities

135
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,560
turns out that they're using washing

136
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,759
machines to make lusty the buttermilk

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,160
drink because it can churn 40 liters of

138
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
lassi in one go yeah they give you lussy

139
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,720
throw a washing made that's a hack

140
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
and that is the smartest hack of them

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
all that's very interesting and you know

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
that's what draws me into the field and

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
i i i can see that that's what draws you

144
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
into

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
into the field as well because

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
you're not satisfied with what's given

147
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
to you you want to play with it on your

148
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,919
own

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,520
see where you can push it to the next

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,560
level

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
in terms of both threats and uh threats

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
and defense

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
um

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,199
i also

155
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,000
there's also two types of personalities

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
i've seen in cyber security

157
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
and two very sharp types of personality

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,759
those who do not wish to own it

159
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
like oh this is given to me but i'd

160
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
rather it just goes away

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
and there are folks like you

162
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
who own it

163
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
so what uh what makes you own this as i

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,600
heard you say earlier that you do not

165
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
wish to

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,840
move out of cybersecurity what keeps you

167
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,880
in

168
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,520
daily uh what keeps me in actually is

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
so

170
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,919
with cyber security the one aspect that

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,680
or one of the many aspects actually that

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
really attracts me is

173
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
you know there's

174
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
something new every day and there's a

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
new challenge we need to tackle every

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,800
day

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
this is what keeps it it's not a routine

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,520
job

179
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,759
if if the person that thinks it's a

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
routine job then they're probably not

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
practicing it as they should because

182
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
there's tons to do there's tons of

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
opportunity for learning

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,280
and i would encourage especially people

185
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
that think it's more of a routine job is

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,960
to try different aspects of it and they

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
would come to discover know that it's

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,800
not as routine as they think it is and

189
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,919
in fact

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
if we don't really hone our skills

191
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,360
that's a very good

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,199
way of putting it

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
then we then attackers will always stay

194
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
ahead of us and this is what we see

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,479
packers always stay ahead of us because

196
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
we're just playing cattle

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
yes

198
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,159
and uh

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,919
how do you hone your skills yourself

200
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
like what what keeps you updated

201
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
personally

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
right um so other than

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,639
what i do personally um

204
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
i i i really like to

205
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
take you know different security courses

206
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,120
that's important

207
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,400
um

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,960
but if that opportunity is not there so

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
what i do is i

210
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,639
i go for the free learning

211
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,400
resources that are out there there are

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,479
tons out there that you can just need to

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
sit there are many videos on youtube you

214
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,520
can come and you know try uh different

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
aspects of security

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
build your own lab i wouldn't call it a

217
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,280
lab really just spin up some virtual

218
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,039
machines install some things on it and

219
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,199
play around with it that that helps

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,759
really yes uh and it doesn't need that

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
much to to set up something

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,479
to to work on so that's what i did so um

223
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
i have my mini lab right

224
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
uh and um i try different uh techniques

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
so i played around with metalsploit a

226
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
lot nice i played around with uh packet

227
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
crafting a lot i played around with um

228
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,879
the defensive side so it's not only

229
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,240
about the attack side but i played

230
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
around with the defensive side set up

231
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,160
the firewall make it harder for

232
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,440
um attackers to to break in uh so that

233
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
gave me that helped me you know build a

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
perspective of how we should secure our

235
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,679
infrastructure and i take all these

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
lessons learned by myself i take that

237
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
all these lessons learned

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
and take them forward in the

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
organization i work for i say okay we

240
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,959
need to do things differently because

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,480
you know attackers can come this way

242
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
i've tried it i know how attackers can

243
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
can bypass security controls

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
um

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
this this helped me personally and i

246
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
really encourage people to really try

247
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,519
and work uh on their own as much as

248
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,360
possible be self-driven you need to be

249
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,519
subdriven

250
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,040
that's a very important point you

251
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
mentioned is you have to be self-driven

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
because nobody's going to be able to do

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
it for you

254
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,640
and

255
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,399
in terms of the landscape as you

256
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
mentioned right things are changing so

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
fast we're always trying to play catch

258
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,920
up

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,800
i

260
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
am an entrepreneur

261
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,040
you are a leader a practitioner of cyber

262
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
security in a large organization

263
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
um but both of us see two areas of

264
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
challenges

265
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
there's a technical challenges that we

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,760
face on a daily basis

267
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
and there's the non-technical or the

268
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,519
human challenges

269
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,839
technologies keep upgrading but but

270
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,760
humans are humans right as a leader

271
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
how do you

272
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
tackle both these challenges

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
on on a daily basis

274
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
what are your tips for

275
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
mastering these challenges of course

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
so yes the human aspect is there but it

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
the way i would approach especially the

278
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
human aspect

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
i mean having that security awareness

280
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
program is important

281
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
but designing it in such a way that

282
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
the message actually reaches the

283
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
audience is even more important

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,440
so um yes it's

285
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
we can have you know that one hour

286
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
session beeping just telling our you

287
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,760
know our employees that okay you need to

288
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
follow the security practice these these

289
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
are the password policies you need to do

290
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
one two three

291
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
but then after one hour people or maybe

292
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
even after the first 10 minutes yes this

293
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
is concentration right

294
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,320
so

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
this is where i think it's important to

296
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,000
team up especially with your

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
communication team how we can you know

298
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
design the method

299
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,959
in such a way that people will follow it

300
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,320
it's easy to understand people will

301
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,360
follow and they understand the

302
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
importance of it

303
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
uh

304
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,320
you can address the human aspect that

305
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,839
way and

306
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
it's important also to have that

307
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
leadership buy-in and the management

308
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
support

309
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
if we have that then

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
it will cascade down if we push it

311
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
bottom up it might not work

312
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,000
so that's a key aspect and the

313
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
technology aspect of it

314
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
the technology aspect of it i see that

315
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,079
it's still driven by people right yes we

316
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
need to train those people that are uh

317
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
working on those technology that

318
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
to make sure that they have the right

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
skills

320
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,959
to configure um or

321
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
to set up our infrastructure in such a

322
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,240
way that

323
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
where

324
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,040
the cyber resilience is uh

325
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,519
improved you know we continuously review

326
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,079
our uh firewall rules we can just

327
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
improve our you know our signature we

328
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,320
continuously improve what our settings

329
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
our hardening controls all those sort of

330
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
things but it's important even from that

331
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,839
idiot focus on the people aspect

332
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,600
that's uh that's an excellent point that

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
you make

334
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
are there any uh i'm sure you've had

335
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,320
many

336
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,200
like any specific aha moments that you

337
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
wish to call out in your own career

338
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
in terms of both discovery of of new

339
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,399
stuff

340
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
as well as

341
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
tackling a very complex challenge in in

342
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
a successful way look um

343
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
initially what i would

344
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
i would not so when i first

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,560
started in this leadership role

346
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,880
[Music]

347
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
how i would approach cyber security i

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,160
would say we need to do one two three

349
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
four

350
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
that i saw that was not the right of

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
course because that got a lot of

352
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,360
resistance because here i am

353
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
as a team telling the business how they

354
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,959
should do their business without

355
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,760
actually involving them in the decision

356
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
of why we should do security in this

357
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
right in this way right

358
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
so

359
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
i changed my approach in the last few

360
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,920
years

361
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,639
drastically in such a way that

362
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,920
these decisions shouldn't come from

363
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
security these are these decisions

364
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,519
should come in line with business we

365
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
agree with business yes this is how we

366
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
should uh approach things

367
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
and i i found out that this approach got

368
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,560
more agreements right

369
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
there might be some resistance but

370
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
that's fine i mean i expect that to

371
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
happen but at the end of the day as long

372
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,800
as i get or we reach to a certain

373
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
understanding and a certain buy-in

374
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,200
comes easier to implement the program

375
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
going forward

376
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,519
that's uh let's i've heard this theme

377
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
that you mentioned

378
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,279
is a very common theme amongst all

379
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,240
successful cyber security leaders is

380
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
that if the alignment doesn't happen

381
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
none of you succeed neither the business

382
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,399
succeeds not the cyber security

383
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,040
so i'm very glad you you've synthesized

384
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,079
that and

385
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
brought that into the into the picture i

386
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
wouldn't say i learned the hard way but

387
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
while i learned so here's the secret

388
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
everybody learns the hard way

389
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,560
it's uh there is no easy way in cyber

390
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
security it's uh

391
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,959
personally never happened for me i mean

392
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
every gray hair on my head is the hard

393
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,680
way story at some point or the other and

394
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,720
there are many um

395
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
in terms of changes

396
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
what have you seen change across the

397
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
landscape

398
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,639
and what has changed but not really

399
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
changed

400
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,639
if you wish to highlight that

401
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
for the audience from a landscape i mean

402
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,160
uh might sound cliche but i mean

403
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,959
the

404
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,320
pandemic

405
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,880
caused a lot of changes in the landscape

406
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
so

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
today the perimeter is no longer the

408
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,560
perimeter right initially people come to

409
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
work and you know we have that perimeter

410
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,600
firewall that protect us so on

411
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,519
today we don't have that right i mean

412
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,519
where is the perimeter anymore people

413
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
working from home and how do we

414
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
expand and people not only work from

415
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,160
home but they work from different

416
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
geographical locations not necessarily

417
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
in uae but maybe outside

418
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,199
so

419
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
how do we make sure we we cover that how

420
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,000
do we make sure we secure all these uh

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
areas so that presented a new challenge

422
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
for us we need to rethink security that

423
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,760
okay maybe um you know our perimeter

424
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
firewall is not what we should focus on

425
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
anymore we should focus on the actual

426
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,079
perimeter today so that's uh one of the

427
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,639
main things that uh

428
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,519
we're focusing on and the second thing

429
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,920
how do we ensure still with people

430
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
working in the different geographical

431
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
locations we ensure that they still get

432
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
that awareness they still get that

433
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,959
knowledge uh

434
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
aspect of it so so that is uh key i

435
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,320
think uh yeah tackle those two uh two

436
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,959
only two but one of those those two uh

437
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,399
aspects then

438
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,560
you know uh

439
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,519
we understand we can re-prioritize uh

440
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,600
where we should focus on

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,079
that's uh actually you're right the the

442
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,839
pandemic has

443
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,759
blown apart the concept of the perimeter

444
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,759
there is there is no perimeter there are

445
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,040
just people

446
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
and there are assets

447
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
and people can be anywhere

448
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
and assets can be anywhere too it's it's

449
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
entirely true

450
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,959
i am actually

451
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,120
pleasantly surprised that

452
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,839
the world continued working through the

453
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,560
pandemic it uh in a way

454
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,758
did not disrupt

455
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
it it brought a few bumps into the

456
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,279
picture but

457
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
somehow we we as a world overcame it and

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,000
we we continued um

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
going ahead right we're kind of seeing

460
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
the tail end of the pandemic i hope i i

461
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,680
pray

462
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,199
um

463
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,639
what would uh

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,240
what kind of positive changes has the

465
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,720
pandemic caused in your workforce

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,959
that you would wish to continue and you

467
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,839
you'd wish that is also adopted by other

468
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
organizations worldwide

469
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,720
that's that's a good point um

470
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
honestly when the pandemic

471
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,839
happened so the change and the shift to

472
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
work from home happened uh

473
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
pretty quickly

474
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,199
and

475
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,640
i wouldn't say we had no say in it but

476
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
that we had to support it

477
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
and perhaps maybe we were not ready to

478
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,199
to shift that into that

479
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,119
but we had to

480
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,039
at some point look back

481
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,840
and and work on it and i found out that

482
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
because still you know the organization

483
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,799
wants to monitor what employees were

484
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,440
doing because at the end of the day

485
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
that has been right at this moment

486
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,280
distributed in different locations how

487
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,360
do we protect that data so uh

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
when we came up with a model on how to

489
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,919
secure this information

490
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
you know with people working remotely

491
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
that got uh acceptance so

492
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
i feel like that

493
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,080
the changes the suggestions we made got

494
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,960
more

495
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,880
listened to because at the end of the

496
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
day you know what are we trying to do

497
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
trying to prevent a breach right yeah so

498
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
uh i feel like this is positive uh and i

499
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,440
feel like

500
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
organizations really starting to listen

501
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,360
to security and embedding it in that

502
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,840
business decision that's that's a very

503
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,720
good point you make

504
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,280
you mentioned

505
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,840
about the human aspect a number of times

506
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
during the during our discussion

507
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,600
and

508
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,440
working i mean i personally believe

509
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
spending

510
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,039
any time in helping

511
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
our team members grow their skills is

512
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,120
always time well invested and what would

513
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
your uh what would your thoughts

514
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
mentorship messages be

515
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,799
to

516
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,400
everyone that you mentor and would

517
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,280
mentor in the future right

518
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
i have one

519
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,600
message never stop

520
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
keep learning that's

521
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
key

522
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
and we're happy to support

523
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
personally i'm happy to support

524
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,960
passionate people self-driven people

525
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
if we find that caliber we're more than

526
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,039
happy to

527
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,840
push them challenge them to to grow in

528
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
that in that area key thing is never

529
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,520
stop

530
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,039
that's that's most important the other

531
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,960
key thing is you've you've been a

532
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,360
practitioner by example

533
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,799
you've done it by getting your hands

534
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
dirty

535
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
you've not waited on

536
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,960
you know

537
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
things being delivered to you

538
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,720
and i see

539
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
this

540
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,559
a number of youngsters coming into the

541
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,640
cyber security landscape

542
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,720
they're starting out their careers

543
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,960
like when folks like me started out

544
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
there were very few resources like we we

545
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
didn't even have

546
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
a broadband internet it came a little

547
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
later in my career

548
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,400
if we wanted to find how to do things

549
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
we have to search through some papers

550
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
articles and try it ourselves you can't

551
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
google it i'm sorry you can't google it

552
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
we cannot google it we cannot google it

553
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
there's no youtube walkthrough of it uh

554
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
there's there's nothing right

555
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
but today there's everything aplenty so

556
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,320
a kid walks into the cyber security a

557
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
student walks in

558
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
everything around how would you help the

559
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
students pick and choose their battles

560
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
and what would your message be for them

561
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
to

562
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
like what is it that's going to drive

563
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
them to excellence and not just

564
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,559
mediocrity okay i'll start first of all

565
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
by saying

566
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,840
know why you picked cybersecurity yes

567
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
if you know why you picked it

568
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,320
it's a challenging it's a very

569
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
challenging

570
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
field and if you do not challenge

571
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
yourself every day to learn something

572
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,600
new

573
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
maybe this field is not for you

574
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
that's one so understand why you want to

575
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
go into cyber city not just because it's

576
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
required in the market there's a gap yes

577
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,159
of course

578
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,159
we need more people in cyber security

579
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,200
100

580
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
we need the right people so

581
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,799
know why

582
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
they want you want to go into cyber

583
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
security that's number one secondly

584
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,720
uh

585
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
as i mentioned have have uh you know

586
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
people to uh

587
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,159
self-learn that's that's key and never

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,080
stop and and pick the right

589
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
pick the right organizations to to work

590
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
for so there might be certain

591
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
organizations that really focus on cyber

592
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
security and help you and certain

593
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
organization where the

594
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
attackers focus on uh maybe financial

595
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
those sectors those are the kind of uh

596
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,400
sectors that you might be interested in

597
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
working for and help

598
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
hone your skills

599
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,039
uh i would say

600
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,559
work on everything start work on

601
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
penetration tests look uh

602
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
try to understand

603
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
download wireshark and look at the

604
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
packets trying to understand each and

605
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,559
every packet what it does i know it

606
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,400
sounds very tough and very challenging

607
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,720
but why not yeah that's how you learn

608
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,080
right yeah that's the only way you learn

609
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
by actually doing it it's a hard work

610
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
exactly might sound cumbersome my at

611
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
it might be challenging you have tons of

612
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,960
free resources

613
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,559
use them so

614
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,679
uh

615
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,120
that's that's the message i really want

616
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,840
to give and uh look there a lot of

617
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,240
programs i've seen i mean we have these

618
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,919
for example cyber security council

619
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,600
they've signed an agreement you know to

620
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
bring an intern so

621
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
there is a huge emphasis on focusing on

622
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,679
the sector we want to bring more

623
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,840
professionals into the market

624
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
so

625
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,720
if you're the right person if you like

626
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
this uh field you know there's tons of

627
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
support and i'm sure you know with time

628
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
you'll be situated in the right

629
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,840
you know

630
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
in the right position and you'll be able

631
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,400
to lead cyber security going forward

632
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,559
pick your battles wisely

633
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,559
know what you're getting into and do it

634
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,120
yourself that's uh that's that's that's

635
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
fantastic um

636
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,520
you reminded me i need to go and pick up

637
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,440
wireshark once again and play with

638
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,720
packets

639
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
it's been a long time since i do it

640
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
makes me feel so comfortable now you

641
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,080
know

642
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,720
you're probably very one of the very few

643
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
security leaders who who still plays

644
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
around with packets that i've seen it

645
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
gladdens me that there are people out

646
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,799
there i'd like to do it more often uh

647
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
but you know if we had even one hour

648
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
extra in the day i would be

649
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
it would be a blessing you know probably

650
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
we can make it happen at heck in the box

651
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
next time maybe yeah you should just

652
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
have you know like

653
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,520
an invite only chatter mouse rules

654
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,080
we put ourselves in and

655
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,880
just

656
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
just have an unfiltered time focused

657
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,679
time absolutely break a few things and

658
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
then we learn that's how we'll learn as

659
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,919
well and look you know these

660
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,919
opportunities like hack in the box i

661
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,880
mean

662
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,640
going back to the you know

663
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,159
student aspect

664
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,440
really they

665
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
i would encourage them to take advantage

666
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,480
of of such events uh

667
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,559
they come maybe every now and then but

668
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
take advantage really there's a lot of

669
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
professionals that we you know we can

670
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,000
talk uh to we can learn a lot from them

671
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
talk to different people really uh

672
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,440
expand your horizon maybe you know even

673
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
in cyber maybe you're you're comfortable

674
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,400
with princess maybe you like something

675
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,840
else later on

676
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,520
why not explore what's what you like and

677
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,600
go for it yeah always push your

678
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,799
