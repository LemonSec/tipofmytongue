1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,440
hi everyone this is uh hope zhang from

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,400
power uae and welcome to

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
this session and thank you for you for

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,400
your attendance my presentation today my

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
presentation topic is about uh virginia

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,760
several security challenges and solution

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
and uh i'm very proud proud and pleasure

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
to give a presentation in high tv

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
several ways

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,120
for the following presentation there

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,440
will be four parts

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
the first one is what the key security

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
challenges of biology networks in this

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,680
part you will understand some main

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
challenges

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,640
rised in application of failure networks

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,079
and exempt

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,840
service security threats

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,879
next

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,160
the second part will introduce the gsma

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
5g cyber security knowledge base

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
and actually this knowledge base can be

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,559
seen as the

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,440
uh

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,559
solution

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,520
base

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
uh for addressing the challenges and

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,880
threats mentioned in part one

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
after understanding the solution and

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
threats i think it's time to

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
introduce the

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,479
cyber security model this model is

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,600
actually

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
will tell us what exactly the server

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
failure cyber security for our

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,040
stakeholders

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,520
so and this cybersecurity model is a

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
layer it contains three kinds of

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,759
layers

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,640
uh representing the application

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,159
application

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,439
network and network equipment

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,880
last but not least

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,680
uh

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
we will introduce a top level design

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,799
principles for failure cyber security

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,920
and

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
those principles are zero trust

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
in-depth defense and adaptive security

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,920
respectively each of them and related

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
security assessment or security

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
assurance standards will be

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,840
specifically

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,959
introduced in this part okay let's go

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
start to the first part

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
nowadays we say

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
uh the usage of fair gene

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,280
or velga networks bring some changes and

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
those changes can be classified into

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,560
three categories

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
the business changes network engines and

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,239
technological changes

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
actually according to the accidental

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
features of the flagship such as

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
enhanced mobile broadband

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,280
massive

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
machine type communication and ultra

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
reliable low latency communications

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
uh thousands of

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
uh

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
types of

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
terminal devices can be connected to the

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
uh virgin network all connected to the

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
other networks

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
so the higher security requirements of

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
the industry must be made it means uh

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,720
there are a lot of new uh security

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
requirements all

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
threats emergence and we must be

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,239
carefully

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
uh consider how to address those new uh

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,400
threats and uh

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,480
under the new context

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,000
uh and for the uh network changes is

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
actually the new architectures the new

86
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
4g software and network deployment

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
architectures introduce new interfaces

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,120
and

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
boundaries

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,159
the new series based uh architecture uh

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,799
i mean sba and a slice architecture

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,280
shall adapt to new security requirements

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,480
such as

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
sba based identity authentication slice

95
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
security protection and a multi-slice

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
risk management to prevent attacks

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,239
and also in the 5g network deployment

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
the user plan function on the core

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,000
network

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,760
in 4g error is moved from the central

101
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
equipment room through the

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
mobile edge computing

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
in aberration i mean say

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,959
this new architecture introduced the new

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,319
boundaries

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
so the extra protection should be

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,720
provided

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,519
in consequence so the convergence of

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
connection and computing also creates

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
new security challenges

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
and

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,720
for the

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
new technologies i mean the technology

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
could change uh clarification and verify

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
virtualization technologies are widely

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
used on 4g coordinate works

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
which creates security risks in

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
you know sharing and the virtualization

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
of infrastructure resources

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,880
so that in this way uh

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,520
is i mean the the benefits is to reduce

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,400
the costs of deployment of deploying

123
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,360
physical infrastructures for different

124
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
network functions

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
in the future

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
the impact of the quantum computing on

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
traditional cryptography algorithms

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
should also be considered

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,440
to ensure network security

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,320
so

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
from next page i will introduce each of

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
those changes and the exact

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,639
cyber security challenges

134
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
the first one is business changes and

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
the security challenges

136
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
nowadays we've heard a lot of people are

137
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,720
saying failure enables thousands of

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
industries and the cyber security issue

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
of factor production and company

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
survival

141
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,759
this is true

142
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,280
for example

143
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
for the smart industry

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
more and more

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
industries are applied applying the

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
telecommunication networks into their

147
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
plans

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
to to increase to increase the

149
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
productivity and also for the smart grid

150
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
uh in the past days we can say some hard

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
working labels doing the very dangerous

152
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
portal inspection work

153
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
because they they must

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,039
they must claim on the high voltage

155
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,000
cables all the towers which is uh very

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
high and very dangerous so today

157
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
through the 4g networks

158
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,919
the labels no longer need to do that and

159
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,600
they can they just

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
use the

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
less drawing to to do the same thing

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,520
and also for the smaller healthcare and

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,199
the smart education

164
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,560
the remote

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
surgery or

166
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,919
removal education

167
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
will come true and

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
the convenience and efficiency of our

169
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
daily life will be

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
dramatically enhanced

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,280
so

172
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
the whole industry come to come to a

173
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
common opinion it is that

174
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
security is the key guarantee for

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
failure industry applications

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
in detail we say the industrial

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,720
applications are carried all are carried

178
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,120
over fleet networks and enterprise

179
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
networks and the uh carrier next

180
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,800
networks are converged it means uh

181
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
verity networks uh

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,479
uh a part of enterprise network

183
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,639
infrastructure and needed to be

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,960
protected based on the industrial

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
requirements

186
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,639
of the enterprise so so the some extra

187
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,720
requirements especially the security

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,840
requirements for the mobile operators

189
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,960
must be

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
concerned or even addressed

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
and also we can say diversified vertical

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
service applications

193
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,240
and

194
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,120
different

195
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
industrial requirements

196
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,160
are

197
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
increasing

198
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
for the

199
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
mobile network of

200
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,280
industry because they want they want to

201
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
achieve different uh

202
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,000
business objects uh according to you

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,599
according to youth the virgin network

204
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,639
therefore

205
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,199
different services in the enterprise

206
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,039
have different requirements

207
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,680
on experience and security

208
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
and the differentiated security

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,240
capabilities are required

210
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
so the more the more the factory

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,520
networks of lg technologies are used

212
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,840
the more cyber security requirements

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,479
uh will be given

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,800
uh the will be given to the different

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,120
stakeholders and not only the mobile

216
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
network operators

217
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
but also some maybe application

218
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,679
developers service providers and also we

219
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
say the user

220
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
euler prime function is deployed as

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
azure to connect to the enterprise

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,039
network to carry enterprise applications

223
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
and meet low latency requirements

224
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
uh which means the enterprise

225
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
data

226
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,839
cannot leave the campus network for

227
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,640
example

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
and this is for the business changes and

229
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
the security challenges

230
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
and next let's see the network changes

231
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,760
and security challenges as i mentioned

232
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
previously

233
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
the most representative or network

234
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,680
changes is about the arc function

235
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
architecture and slides

236
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,519
and here in this page on the left hand

237
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
side the first uh box is

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
picked up

239
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
the service based arc architecture and

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
in this in this figure you can see

241
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
okay the

242
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
many uh network service function

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
modules are

244
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,839
isolated

245
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,720
uh

246
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,440
and for example you as you can see the

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
uh access mobile function uh you unify

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
the data management authentication

249
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
server function

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
uh session management function and the

251
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
user plan function they are uh isolated

252
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,880
they are no longer merged together

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
uh in this way the benefits is each

254
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
function is arranged by

255
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,880
their own interface

256
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
and the service requirement can use each

257
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
of them individually and independently

258
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
so the whole

259
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
the whole cost of all the

260
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
service architecture will be reduced

261
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
and the service flexibility will be

262
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
increased

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,480
so

264
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,959
with we say the 5g corner worker

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,320
internal modules are reconstructed as a

266
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
service based architecture to support

267
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
on-demand service deployment this will

268
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
be very effective manner

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
and also the slides actually each class

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
can be seen as a requirement based

271
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
uh virtual network and this virtual

272
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
network is uh

273
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,360
is dedicated uh this will and the

274
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
slides under each slides won't be shared

275
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,839
with other users

276
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,079
so the flash enables faster service

277
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
deployment and the capacity expansion

278
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,560
it will also reduce the costs as a

279
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,760
result

280
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,560
however the related challenges is quite

281
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,800
straightforward and obvious

282
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,839
uh

283
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,200
in the future

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
cornell worker the network equip

285
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
equipment identity authentication and

286
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,720
message communication based on fba must

287
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
be protected which means

288
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
although we say

289
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,920
the

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
issue network equipment all service

291
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,160
function modules are isolated but uh

292
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,120
actually

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
they can't be accessed without any

294
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,160
protection or authentication and all the

295
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,920
re authorization

296
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
also for the slides the boundaries

297
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,519
between among different slices must be

298
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,240
isolated to prevent the attacks

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,079
among them

300
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,839
so that so the

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,480
for example the resource abuse

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
based on the slides will be avoided

303
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,680
and also the the the other very

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
representative network changes is about

305
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,200
the

306
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
uh user plan function uh is a move

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,959
removed from the failure corner work and

308
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
on your on the right hand side

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
figure we can see the upf is

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
deployed within the mesa

311
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,040
so

312
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
uh we say so

313
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,079
positively the upfront support dancing

314
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,480
deployment to support a local traffic

315
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
distribution and reduce the service

316
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
latency this is

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
quite

318
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,399
useful helpful and uh

319
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
cost of beneficial

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
but uh the ups but better since the upf

321
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
runs from from the central equipment

322
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
room to the azure equipment room or in

323
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,040
the press compressor the board

324
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,440
protection needs to be enhanced and

325
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
provided

326
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
otherwise the safety and security of the

327
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
upf is quite problematic

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
okay the last changes is that technology

329
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,800
changes are security challenges

330
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,000
uh

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,720
actually in the past days i mean in the

332
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
4g or 3g

333
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
error the

334
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,279
each hardware is dedicated for only one

335
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,160
network equipment all the service

336
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
functions for example on the legacy

337
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
maybe the for example the ip

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
uh multi

339
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,120
multi uh media

340
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
subsystem

341
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
and this

342
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,399
and this uh involve the packet con

343
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,880
control is they are physically isolated

344
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,519
and the physical bar is quite clear and

345
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
each of

346
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,680
the hardwares are provided

347
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
in independently and

348
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
individually but nowadays to

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,480
increase the

350
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,760
service

351
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
effectiveness and reduce the cost

352
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
uh the network function virtualization

353
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
is uh

354
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
is used and it has becomes a mandatory

355
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
in 5g

356
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
let's say this uh this figure there are

357
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,079
three new existing uh components the

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,279
first one is

359
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,959
the hardware basics

360
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,279
it means uh uh while

361
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,600
one hardware infrastructure will be

362
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
provided for all kinds of uh network

363
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
equipments

364
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
or network functions

365
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
uh to do this the segment in newly seen

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
is uh is introduced this is the

367
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
virtualization layer

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
uh according to this virtualization

369
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,760
layer uh

370
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,600
those net different network functions

371
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
can be approached according to many many

372
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
uh virtual machines

373
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,160
uh so

374
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
uh in order to uh

375
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,760
manage them and

376
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
manage i mean manage those network

377
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,279
functions

378
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,519
the manual the management and also

379
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
orchestration components

380
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
is needed so

381
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,680
due to those newly introduced compos

382
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,959
components

383
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,720
the security challenges are also as uh

384
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
introduced as a result uh let's let's

385
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,880
see

386
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
what they are further infrastructure

387
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
resource sharing the traditional

388
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,160
physical security boundaries are broken

389
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,399
resource sharing are authorized resource

390
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
function application layer data exercise

391
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,240
and imaging and image tempering

392
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
etc

393
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
and for the virtualization

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,240
layer

395
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
uh common software and the ice layer

396
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
operate open source software may

397
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
introduce industrial vulnerabilities and

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,480
open vulnerabilities are more likely to

399
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
be exploited for attacks

400
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
and for the virtualized resource

401
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,199
management

402
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
for the manual so

403
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,759
in virtual resource management the user

404
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,759
spoofing and high risk or pressures

405
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
cause resource abuse

406
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
it means

407
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,680
the manual will be targeted

408
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
to launch the several attacker and also

409
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
if the ultrasonic process is attached

410
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
the network equipment software package

411
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,959
can be temporary ways

412
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,360
after understanding those challenges

413
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,160
let's see the exact cyber security

414
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
threats

415
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,680
targeting the value network

416
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,839
and in this topology those threats are

417
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,839
summarized into

418
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,199
nine tabs

419
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
and they are involved into the

420
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,399
into the air interface

421
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
uh internet remaining external access

422
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,440
transporter slides i mean say

423
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
5g

424
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,800
call network clarification and so on

425
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,439
maybe you can

426
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,800
feel

427
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,600
that

428
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
the threat is

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
quite more

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
but actually uh

431
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,639
in this uh for those threads the red one

432
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,480
are newly

433
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,720
in newly mer uh

434
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
exists in the fashion

435
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,000
and under the others the black one

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,559
have existed for in the

437
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,640
uh 14 hour work

438
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,439
uh

439
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,359
let's see each of those red one fully

440
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
air interface

441
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,559
because we know

442
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,079
there will be

443
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,359
many many kinds of terminal devices

444
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
all applications

445
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,559
uh connected to the vertical network so

446
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
the denial of so the ddos attacker will

447
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,640
be

448
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,679
a very

449
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,720
uh

450
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
harmful threat for the virgin network

451
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
uh and also uh due to the

452
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
dancing of the upf and

453
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,880
uh and the the ups and

454
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,559
other uh

455
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,080
third party apps

456
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
are deployed on the mobile edge

457
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,679
computing

458
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,320
which is out of the corner work or

459
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
central equipment room

460
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,799
so the the security

461
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,880
of the connection among uh mec and other

462
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,039
network components

463
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
is uh should

464
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
it threatened

465
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,120
uh

466
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
and for the slides

467
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,240
this is quite quite a representative and

468
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,440
a newly uh introduced component of

469
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
infection network

470
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
so

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,480
the threat is authorized the operating

472
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
and management access resource of using

473
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
among slices and the

474
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,720
data leakage among slices

475
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
at the fourth me say

476
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,559
for example as i will mention the muc

477
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,360
is

478
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,160
the mec's protection is uh

479
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
independent is independent ways is a

480
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,960
very coronal worker protection so the

481
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,840
parameter attack should be concerned and

482
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
the attacking of mec and and the the

483
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,360
attacker of muc itself all the attacker

484
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
on the

485
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,640
components

486
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,960
involved in the i mean say for example

487
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
the attack on upfront the third-party

488
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
apps

489
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,720
or even the hardware and a

490
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
virtualization layered is quite

491
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,120
uh problematic for the mvc security

492
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
and flow of algae corneal wall threads

493
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,039
uh

494
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,600
as i mentioned earlier the service based

495
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,600
architecture is a newly targeted source

496
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
so the sba threads is a is a newly

497
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
thread for the virgin network

498
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,919
uh and also

499
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
for the technological uh

500
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
change i mean the clarification the

501
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
lasso the last part

502
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
we can see the network of functional

503
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
virtualization strengths

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
uh and the

505
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
continuous rates and the manuals are all

506
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,559
threats involved into the qualification

507
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,840
strategy

508
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
and this this is all kinds of

509
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
currently

510
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,640
uh

511
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
existing stress and as and we also

512
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
believe there will be some upcoming

513
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,960
threats

514
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
uh however

515
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
does that mean

516
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159
those does that mean the failure network

517
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,120
is a

518
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,919
less secure than 4g

519
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,039
or which one is much secure

520
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
is more secure so

521
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
uh trying to answer this question we i

522
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,280
think uh

523
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,919
we should be firstly review the the

524
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,880
security history of 4g the 4g network is

525
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
based on a serious security solutions

526
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
and has not been attempted in a large

527
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,120
scale in last 10 years

528
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
so

529
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
first the first thing is we can

530
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,480
uh

531
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,919
we can

532
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
confirm that the 4g 4g is secure and

533
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,039
okay let's see

534
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
how about 5g

535
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,080
in summary we say the failure uses the

536
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,559
4g security architecture and further

537
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,000
enhances security for some known risks

538
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,080
uh how to understand that

539
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,679
we choose

540
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,080
six specs in 4g and make a comparison

541
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,480
with the failure actually

542
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
they are cryptography algorithm

543
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,679
air interface security user privacy

544
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,559
protection security policy user

545
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
authentication experience and the

546
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,320
remaining security

547
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
by comparison we can see in 4g there is

548
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
there are stronger cryptography

549
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,400
algorithm

550
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
better air interface security

551
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,080
stronger

552
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,799
user privacy protections flexible

553
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,080
security policy unify the user

554
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
authentication and enhance the remaining

555
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
remaining security

556
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
this is because

557
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
for the upgrade encryption algorithm the

558
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,400
4g uses 128 best encryption but 5g used

559
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
256

560
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
and for the

561
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
user air interface security there is no

562
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
integrity protection

563
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
for the user plan in 4g but this time in

564
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,840
4g there is a user plan into integrity

565
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
protection

566
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,159
and

567
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,240
for the privacy protection

568
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,600
the fellow uses the subscriber concealed

569
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
identifier and also in the 4g

570
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,919
the security policy is just a network

571
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,159
level it means one for all one policy

572
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
for all kinds of

573
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
subscribers but in the 5g each

574
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
subscriber is arranged with

575
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,000
a different security policy

576
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,720
and also for the authentication if in

577
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
the 4g network the authentication is

578
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
different for different

579
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
access but for the 5g the whole

580
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
user authentication

581
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
is unified

582
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,760
so this is much easier to manage the

583
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
user authentication and provide a more

584
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,679
secure authentication

585
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,320
last but not least

586
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,840
in the past days

587
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,440
i mean the

588
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,919
transmission of a remaining subscriber

589
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
data in 4g this is the plaintext

590
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,280
but but in today's 5g this plant tester

591
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,080
is

592
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
secure and

593
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
one component is a

594
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
is added this is called security edge

595
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,000
protection proxy

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
so among different networks the

597
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,280
remaining data among them are encrypted

598
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,159
and

599
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,440
protected

600
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
all right after understanding the

601
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
challenges and the threats

602
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
we can conclude that uh

603
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,640
the

604
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,159
although the failure is facing uh more

605
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,200
risks

606
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,760
but we are very confident that that

607
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,120
those risks

608
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,159
are controllable and manageable under

609
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,480
able to be reduced

610
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,039
and also in some aspects the flg is a

611
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
more secure than 4g

612
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
okay

613
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,159
in this part let's

614
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
go have a look at the gsma 4g cyber

615
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,760
security knowledge base

616
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,320
based on industrial requirements

617
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,000
uh i mean the

618
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
i mean we have seen the

619
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
uh 4g network enables thousands of

620
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,600
industries so there must be many

621
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
many a massive number of security

622
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
requirements so

623
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
uh gsma oversees the cyber security

624
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
knowledge base to provide the guidance

625
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,200
and the references for ensuring mobile

626
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,679
communication network security

627
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
this is because understanding mapping

628
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,400
and mitigating those existing and

629
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,600
upcoming

630
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,640
security threats in an objective speedy

631
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,960
and effective manner has become

632
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
essential

633
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
and also gsma has developed the baseline

634
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,480
security controls to help operators

635
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
understand and develop for their

636
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
security posture

637
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
to a foundation level ensures that

638
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,120
failure network

639
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,400
security is manageable and verifiable

640
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
and continuously enhances the cyber

641
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,600
security resilience

642
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
and also the the positioning of this uh

643
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,520
uh

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
cyber security knowledge base

645
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
uh is to include the industrial

646
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,440
consensus threat map map mitigation

647
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
strategies and the measures for

648
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
different roles

649
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
stakeholders and best practices

650
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,919
and it is highly recommended that

651
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,720
the stakeholders all of network

652
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,640
operators and equipment vendors of lg uh

653
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
should a virgin network should use this

654
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
uh

655
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,919
cybersecurity knowledge base and this

656
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,919
server superior knowledge base has

657
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,159
uh has been published in this year and

658
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,559
you can visit it on the jsme website

659
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,039
also i would like i would like to

660
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,600
introduce some some more details about

661
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,200
this cyber security uh knowledge base uh

662
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,360
the first part is about

663
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
who made it

664
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
that actually the gsma coordinates

665
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,840
industrial stakeholders such as

666
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,480
operators application providers device

667
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,200
vendors and regulatory agencies

668
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,159
to jointly develop a detailed 4g

669
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,080
cybersecurity knowledge base for threat

670
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,120
and the size and the mitigation measures

671
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,039
uh that is they call this is the

672
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,080
security codex lg ready

673
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,400
here i show some examples here

674
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,840
the gsm members participant into this

675
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
front-end security working group for

676
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,760
discussion and development and it

677
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
involves mobile operators and vendors

678
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,279
for example the operators such as

679
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,760
vodafone sunrise orange telefonica are

680
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,880
shattered and so on and vendors like

681
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
huawei eriksson nokia

682
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,840
zte samsung nce they joined and also

683
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,799
some security vendors also participates

684
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,559
participated

685
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,480
such as nano numbers adaptive mobile

686
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
and also those knowledge base refers to

687
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,600
the output of standards organizations

688
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,320
and uh and organizations in the industry

689
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,440
it means

690
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,480
the the content of this knowledge base

691
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
as well it is also based on some

692
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
well-recognized

693
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
and uh internationally

694
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,320
uh accepted

695
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,640
standards such as for example 3gpp

696
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,200
and in isa uh gsm prd and eastern

697
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
and those are the and those atoms are

698
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,039
the specific

699
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,320
referred

700
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,240
uh standards

701
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,039
and this is who made it and what kind of

702
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,840
what flg cyber security knowledge base

703
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,399
contents

704
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,279
and the next let's see the structure of

705
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
the knowledge base

706
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
from bottom to the up

707
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,000
for the for the bottom layer this is we

708
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
see this is a layer tool it contains the

709
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
fellowship network a typical threads

710
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,120
and each

711
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,000
small box represents an exact

712
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,520
document for example the fs30 real

713
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,200
network slides

714
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,240
a

715
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
network of

716
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,799
functional

717
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,279
virtual virtualization threads

718
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,520
and the other is about the failure key

719
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
security solutions

720
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,399
and this is and this is a control and

721
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,559
based on according to threats and based

722
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
on controls

723
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
the baseline security controls are

724
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,880
defined

725
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,840
uh and also

726
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
and also we know the gsme has published

727
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,159
many other

728
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,120
different uh secretive documents

729
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,159
uh in different ways so the overview of

730
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,080
this failure cyber security knowledge

731
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,840
base uh

732
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,279
is

733
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
involved it is composed of the

734
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,559
background and scope of this knowledge

735
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,960
base and a mapping relationship with

736
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,799
other documents

737
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,880
uh in gsma

738
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,559
so we say

739
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,360
so it is said the gsma foundry cyber

740
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,600
security knowledge base builds a

741
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
comprehensive value network security

742
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,919
knowledge system and the proposed

743
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,000
baseline security control methods based

744
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,200
on typical friendly network threads

745
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,080
and

746
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,840
a series of k-security

747
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,760
solutions all right

748
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,720
after

749
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
looking at the overview let's keep a

750
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,159
closer eye on the contents

751
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,520
the first part is about the threads

752
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
actually the

753
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,240
base comprehensively analyzes the risks

754
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,480
attack methods and impacts of mobile

755
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,679
networks

756
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,840
the further comprehensive threat and

757
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
analysis for networks ada

758
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,880
uh it'll summarize and summarize the

759
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,640
different files and under the threads

760
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
uh targeting on this file for example

761
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,760
epic application files uh what the

762
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
threads is malicious application

763
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,159
uh user com

764
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,880
compromising or theft of personal data

765
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,279
for the call network fails the threat is

766
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,000
detox it starts attack against chronic

767
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,200
work a voice call uh it was dropping on

768
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,840
the mobile communication monitoring

769
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,520
and for the

770
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
for each of this

771
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,320
uh

772
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,200
threat such as the dos attack against

773
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,880
the cornell worker

774
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,120
it is described specifically and also

775
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
the knowledge base gave the

776
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,679
show the attack methodology how to learn

777
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,600
it means how to launch the attack and

778
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,120
also the potential impact is shown as as

779
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,360
a result of launching structural attack

780
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,720
and a further solution or controls

781
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,559
the jsma foreign civil security

782
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
knowledge base gives

783
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,480
firstly show the risk and mitigation

784
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,039
responsibilities of stakeholders

785
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,559
this is quite reasonable and

786
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,320
straightforward because when we don't

787
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,000
understand

788
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,159
the responsibilities of different

789
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,279
stakeholders it is it will be very very

790
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
difficult to make sure the security of

791
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,039
the 5g

792
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,159
so in the knowledge base the

793
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,799
gsma showed a shared responsibility and

794
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,960
it involves the

795
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
involves the

796
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,760
application

797
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,559
uh operator and the network operators

798
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,640
and the vendors

799
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,799
and it is summarized that application

800
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,960
security responsibility of application

801
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,919
developer is a responsibility of

802
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,600
application developers and service

803
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,320
providers the network security commonly

804
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,600
managed controlled and cooperated rather

805
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,080
mobile network operators but some

806
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
elements may be also

807
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,200
be all sourced to specialize the service

808
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,960
providers

809
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,679
and for the products of security this is

810
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,880
the responsibility of the vendors

811
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
after understanding after clarifying the

812
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
responsibility it's time to show

813
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,279
to show how to mitigate the

814
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,080
how how to mitigate the uh

815
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,880
they attack all the threats here is an

816
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
example of ddos attack against the core

817
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,399
network

818
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,440
so

819
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,279
the navigation

820
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,679
measures include includes other

821
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,519
stakeholders including the service

822
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,880
provider and

823
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
what they and what the service provider

824
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
should do has been

825
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,039
documented here and for the operators

826
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,120
and the photo vendors and also some

827
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,600
references are given here to

828
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,039
help the readers to better understand

829
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,039
all compile the security clearance

830
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,159
therefore

831
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,679
the gsma believes 5g security risks can

832
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,799
be addressed through the deployment and

833
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,320
coordinated

834
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
and verifiable

835
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,159
security measures based on common

836
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,240
standards

837
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,080
uh in the

838
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
last part we will give give a short

839
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,159
introduction about these common

840
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,600
standards

841
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,760
after looking at the

842
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,880
the risk mitigation let's say the

843
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
baseline

844
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,480
security control that mobile operators

845
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,240
can consider

846
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,679
deploying for the controls it can it

847
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,679
involves two types

848
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,000
one is business control and the other is

849
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
the technology controls i think

850
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
most of us

851
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,799
may must be very familiar with the

852
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,440
technical controls however this term

853
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,480
the business controls are given

854
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,240
for example such as the broad level

855
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
engagement role

856
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,480
formally recognize the security

857
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,440
organization policies and so on it means

858
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
the whole

859
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,320
security

860
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
deployment is a

861
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
engineer job it involves different

862
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
actors with different

863
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
uh controls and also for the

864
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,320
uh

865
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
east control module uh the related team

866
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,399
is

867
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,360
mapped

868
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,840
to better understand how to evolve how

869
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,520
to merge the business control and the

870
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,440
camera controls together

871
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,719
uh besides the secure and a security

872
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
material model is proposed in the in

873
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,639
this space

874
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,560
because of which can be used to assess

875
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,239
the maturity level of information

876
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,560
security and service control levels

877
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,520
uh the levels of uh level one two five

878
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,599
will represent the recognization of the

879
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,800
control and the

880
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
deployment process

881
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,960
of the maturity level operators using

882
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,440
these controls can compare the list of

883
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
controls with their deploy the internal

884
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,079
security control

885
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,560
so that they can be so that their

886
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,239
current security controls can be

887
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,839
improved or increased

888
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,760
okay after

889
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,000
uh introducing the

890
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,199
challenges

891
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,639
the

892
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,240
uh solutions now we can have

893
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
we can have a look at

894
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,119
what a

895
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,040
5g security exactly mean for different

896
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
stakeholders

897
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
uh again this is uh

898
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
this

899
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,000
uh this is a layer model and this is

900
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760
their model

901
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,800
is a

902
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
same as the jsma's layer model

903
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,960
but i i want to show it here to help us

904
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,480
better understand

905
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,280
uh

906
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,440
what does the virgin network security

907
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,480
mean for different stakeholders in

908
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
practice

909
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,560
the the first layer is application

910
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,359
security this is the full boss listed

911
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,520
for both traditional mobile and end

912
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,040
users and vertical industries that

913
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,960
provide our or use a range of

914
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
applications and this security layer

915
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,880
requires a collaboration of more

916
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,079
operators

917
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,000
devices suppliers

918
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,400
and application providers to ensure the

919
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,720
security of lg

920
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,760
networks and the users and services they

921
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,880
support

922
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,119
and also the application security is not

923
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,119
heavily dependent on the security of

924
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,520
network of perhaps

925
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
a vertical industry must take

926
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
responsibilities for the security of

927
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,280
their solutions

928
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
protect the critical assets at the

929
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,320
application layer from network attacks

930
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
promotely detect security threats

931
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,359
and quickly restore this basic services

932
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,400
and next is the network security and

933
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,119
operating and management security

934
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,200
this layer is usually managed and

935
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,079
operated by operation operators they

936
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,079
consider they should consider network

937
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,280
compliance

938
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
and security of network design

939
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,760
deployment operating and management and

940
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,040
operations and continuously

941
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
perform

942
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
comprehensive risk assessment based on

943
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,280
network component as well as network

944
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,480
equipment

945
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
and the art architectures provided by

946
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,200
the vendors to ensure effective

947
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,400
management

948
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,119
of security threats

949
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,320
and last

950
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
layer sorry the last layer is for the

951
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
network equipment

952
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,720
uh actually

953
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
this layer must be provided

954
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,320
by equipment vendors it focuses on the

955
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,359
compliance security development process

956
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,640
and security capability capabilities of

957
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,000
products

958
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
security assessment is

959
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
critical for product security

960
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,280
it provides a basic basis for assessing

961
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,079
whether network equipment and components

962
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,240
are designed and implemented in

963
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,560
compliance with the security

964
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,720
requirements

965
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
and

966
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
on the right hand side there are

967
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,280
industrial standards and methodologies

968
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,240
to

969
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,359
guide

970
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,800
how to

971
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,480
make each layer secure

972
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,040
and they are also well recognized and

973
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,280
good references

974
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,839
so we say the failure of cyber security

975
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,480
is a shared responsibility of case

976
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,520
stakeholders including operators

977
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,839
interconnection providers

978
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,560
equipment vendors application providers

979
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,680
standards organizations governments

980
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
regulators each with their own clearly

981
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,599
defined responsibilities

982
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,680
those responsibilities

983
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,320
well fulfilled can enable the secure

984
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,880
deployment and the operations of lg

985
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,359
system

986
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,079
and

987
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,680
in this page

988
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,480
this is actually the exact

989
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,079
cyber security

990
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,280
modules should be concerned for

991
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,000
network equipment security and the uh

992
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,520
and for the net network operators

993
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
for example some

994
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,440
for example the vendors must provide a

995
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,560
trusted involved developing development

996
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,280
environment it must have

997
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,920
ensured that data security

998
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,680
when the data flow of union is equipment

999
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,880
and for the network security it involves

1000
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,560
involves networking security run

1001
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,880
security strategy car networks security

1002
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,599
and mobile edge computing security

1003
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,200
uh with those with those uh security

1004
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,400
uh guaranteeing or assurance

1005
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,359
the application security such as

1006
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,000
such as the the user data security can

1007
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,280
be guaranteed

1008
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,240
okay

1009
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,200
uh

1010
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,599
we are wrapped at the last part of this

1011
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,079
presentation in this this part i'm going

1012
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,000
to talk about some top level design

1013
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,680
principles for 4g

1014
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,560
cyber security

1015
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
the whole

1016
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,599
design track

1017
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,000
principles are still based on the

1018
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,079
three-layer security model the

1019
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,640
productive security network security and

1020
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,200
application security and also the three

1021
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,040
main principles

1022
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,079
should be

1023
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:02,800
can

1024
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,839
not pay more attention they are their

1025
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,960
trust

1026
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,560
in-depth defense and adaptive security

1027
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
for the zero trust it means

1028
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,200
continuous evaluation and the dynamic

1029
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,480
often of

1030
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
authorization in failure network the

1031
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,560
purpose is to

1032
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
defend against

1033
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,760
smoothing

1034
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
evaluation of privilege

1035
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,560
and also for the in-depth defense of

1036
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,720
purpose is to defend against

1037
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,079
ddos attack

1038
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
uh malicious excess

1039
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,119
excess

1040
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,079
and

1041
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,240
to protect the to guaranteeing the

1042
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,599
encryption and the antenna tempering and

1043
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,480
for the adaptive security they are

1044
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
the uh it is proposed to continuous

1045
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,760
detection especially the abnormal

1046
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,720
security event and also do the and also

1047
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,520
do the practical proactive closed-up

1048
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,480
security control

1049
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,800
besides of them

1050
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,119
the security standards and the best

1051
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,960
practice must be

1052
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,640
referred and

1053
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
and involved into

1054
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,119
implementing those three kinds of

1055
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,480
principles

1056
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
uh and also to

1057
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,200
uh try to better understand how those

1058
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,079
principles are well implemented in

1059
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,119
practice

1060
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,640
some security governance and assessments

1061
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,160
are essential for the security

1062
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
evaluation

1063
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
let's see the first

1064
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,760
principle in-depth defense

1065
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
uh it is actually to build four lines of

1066
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,800
defense to establish the an all-round in

1067
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,920
in-depth

1068
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,560
defense system for virgin networks sorry

1069
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,440
the sentence is a bit rewarding uh and

1070
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,480
uh

1071
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,359
the first uh actually the the in-depth

1072
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,760
defense is like a

1073
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,440
anya model

1074
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,680
there are different layers

1075
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,720
for the

1076
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,760
protection purpose the first one is

1077
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,359
the fair wall

1078
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,520
this is arranged at

1079
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,560
the boundary between network and

1080
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,800
other places out of network

1081
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,359
and the second one is for the

1082
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,240
uh the second is for the romanian

1083
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,119
security i mean the security edge

1084
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,000
promotion security as from protection

1085
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,680
proxy and

1086
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,800
this is around this is assigned between

1087
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,520
different networks

1088
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
and the third

1089
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,560
layer

1090
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
protection is

1091
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,760
located in the network equipment

1092
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,839
each network equipment should not be

1093
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,760
uh accessed directly and the

1094
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,520
communication among them must be

1095
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
protected

1096
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,079
and the last one is the

1097
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,839
further isolation of

1098
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,280
virtual machines

1099
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,359
in summary we say

1100
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,760
in summary those four cancel for

1101
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,400
protection layers are border protection

1102
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,960
protection service proxy network

1103
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,359
equipment isolation and virtual machine

1104
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,920
isolation

1105
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,920
the second the second principle is zero

1106
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,599
trust and valgey

1107
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,359
uh this as well known zero truster is a

1108
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,920
quite a popular i.t

1109
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,599
concept in recent years

1110
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,640
and and uh and we all think the zero

1111
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,319
transfer concept

1112
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,240
is very helpful to

1113
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,599
build a

1114
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480
uh a secure a more secure

1115
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,040
uh ict network so we build

1116
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,200
neurotransmitter model 4k aspects of

1117
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,920
virtual networks it means

1118
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
we just use

1119
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,000
some of the

1120
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,880
variable transfer concepts to protect

1121
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,079
some

1122
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,359
critical aspects of vaginal works

1123
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,200
let's firstly see the left-hand side

1124
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,480
figure

1125
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
this is a basic struct structure of the

1126
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,200
uh xero trust our fellowship networks

1127
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,240
in in this rare circle and at first it

1128
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,319
includes the policy engine and the

1129
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,440
policy administrator and those policies

1130
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,240
are

1131
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,800
designed are designed to

1132
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,920
protect or prevent a protector attack

1133
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,800
against the user and administrator

1134
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,119
and the boston hosts

1135
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,040
fair wars routers and as eep on

1136
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,079
security control program will be used as

1137
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,359
a policy enforcement point

1138
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,839
so in this way the zero trust flg is

1139
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,280
is to protect the excess control and

1140
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,240
according to the refund authorization of

1141
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,119
telecom users and administrators to

1142
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,680
reduce the attack services

1143
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,839
for the zero trust access

1144
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,400
for example the unified data management

1145
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,119
authentication on the authorization

1146
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,079
access mobile function access control

1147
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,920
and

1148
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
and also the slice access control are

1149
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,640
concerned according to

1150
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,560
zero transfer and for the administrator

1151
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,720
it is called zero trust operating and

1152
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
management the business hosts the

1153
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,119
authentication and authorization through

1154
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,200
the permission control

1155
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,400
equipment

1156
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,880
equipment management system identify

1157
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,760
identity authentication and management

1158
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,640
and management permission control

1159
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,160
here exams

1160
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,480
here is an example of operating and

1161
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,800
management identity management

1162
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,119
of xero transaction as you can see the

1163
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,839
device and the users will be verified in

1164
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,359
different ways

1165
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,040
and a further

1166
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,520
further enforcement point

1167
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,920
it involves anti-authentication dynamic

1168
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,640
control and the dynamic evaluation

1169
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,119
and according to the

1170
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,119
the date according to the logs and the

1171
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,880
control policies are

1172
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
enforced according accordingly

1173
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,040
and the last one is adaptive security

1174
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,119
it's actually continuous detection and

1175
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,079
proactive closed up based on the ipdl

1176
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,160
methodology as well know the fpdr

1177
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,680
methodology is

1178
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,200
designed by the mister it means

1179
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,839
identification and protection

1180
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,000
detection

1181
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,200
response and recovery uh the purpose is

1182
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,839
to integrate attack adaptive security to

1183
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,319
build intrinsic energy security

1184
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,800
capabilities and develop dynamic

1185
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,680
security solutions that are continuously

1186
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,680
optimized because in

1187
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,160
nowadays we think

1188
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,119
uh

1189
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,440
the security is quite essential and

1190
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,240
critical but the way for the security is

1191
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,520
a bridge what should we do and this

1192
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,880
adapted

1193
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,480
so it is very

1194
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,480
uh mediated for

1195
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,760
for uh

1196
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,960
for an adaptive security manner and

1197
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
this is this has become

1198
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,560
another principle

1199
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,640
so

1200
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,480
so in this way maybe the risk is polar

1201
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,200
period can be reduced from weeks to

1202
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,240
hours

1203
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,319
and the threat detection time can be

1204
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,640
reduced from monthly to minutes

1205
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,240
and also the

1206
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,599
response response time will be reduced

1207
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,400
from days and to minute two minutes

1208
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,040
uh in this way

1209
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,520
in this way the uh some security

1210
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,280
incident all risks can be uh

1211
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,319
can be discovered or found in time

1212
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,599
and

1213
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,960
and the service availability will be

1214
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,160
guaranteed

1215
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,839
timely

1216
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,200
normally it involves some

1217
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,680
intelligent analysis and automatic

1218
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,960
forensics

1219
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,720
under confirmation and the policy

1220
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,920
distribution the topology can be shown

1221
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,480
can be shown by this figure

1222
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,800
the first part is the network equipment

1223
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,200
and the network protection policy

1224
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,119
and they will be enforced

1225
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,720
they will be enforced on threat of

1226
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,000
detection based on hosts logs and flaws

1227
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,720
and also those those are a useful

1228
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,680
message or threat method intelligence

1229
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,960
can be sent to the salk and

1230
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,280
the network security events will be

1231
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,280
determined or identified

1232
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,559
and then

1233
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,800
the network equipment and the

1234
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,599
network response will be

1235
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,160
network response and recovery policies

1236
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,119
will be

1237
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,880
forced to all

1238
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,599
all trigger

1239
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,559
and as we mentioned very earlier

1240
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,440
we it is still needed to understand some

1241
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,680
uh security assurance or security

1242
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,920
assessment or methodologies

1243
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,720
uh

1244
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
so that we can

1245
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
uh make sure

1246
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,520
we can make sure all externally uh say

1247
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,480
okay our network on our network

1248
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,559
equipment are secure

1249
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,440
um

1250
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,520
nowadays there are some

1251
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,119
a good framework one is nissans and the

1252
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,040
other is called scots

1253
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,800
and actually there are

1254
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
mobile communication network security

1255
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,200
test specification and assessment

1256
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,160
mechanism developed by gsma and 3gpp

1257
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,040
and which are jointly developed by major

1258
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
global operators

1259
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,240
suppliers

1260
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,960
industrial partners and regulators

1261
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,760
the network equipment of vendors are

1262
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,960
audited and tested by independent and

1263
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,400
authority third-party organizations in

1264
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,040
detail the nissan covers the evaluation

1265
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,240
of

1266
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,119
vendors product development and product

1267
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,240
life circle the stars

1268
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,440
this is

1269
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,599
the full name is security assurance

1270
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,559
specification it provides a description

1271
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,800
of the security requirements

1272
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,960
uh partnering through a given network

1273
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,680
production classes

1274
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,960
there are many benefits

1275
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,000
for the case still holders of for

1276
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,599
applying nissan's discussion for example

1277
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,480
for the equipment vendors the

1278
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,359
nissan sun scars provides an application

1279
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,920
from the world's leading mobile industry

1280
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,680
representative body

1281
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,720
delivers a world-class security review

1282
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,280
of security related process offers a

1283
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,240
uniform approach to security audits and

1284
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,000
it can it can also avoid the

1285
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,240
fragmentation and potentially

1286
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,920
conflicting security assurance

1287
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,480
requirements in different markets

1288
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,400
and also

1289
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,680
for example for the

1290
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,000
for the regulators uh because the nissas

1291
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,240
and scots develop developed are

1292
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,319
developed by the mobile communication

1293
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,640
industry to prevent the stanzas from

1294
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,040
fragmented fragmentation

1295
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,319
uh

1296
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,880
and maintained by industry and

1297
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,440
continuously involving and the enhanced

1298
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
costly effective innovative

1299
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
and also a low market injury barrier and

1300
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,280
promoted security benefits

1301
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,599
so it is nowadays it is highly

1302
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,119
recommended for the industry to to do

1303
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,680
the nissa's discuss application

1304
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,040
implementation and certification

1305
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,400
and also

1306
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,480
since we we understand the importance

1307
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
and the benefits of

1308
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,440
applying the unified standards

1309
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
uh huawei has obtained the key

1310
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,319
assessment in the industry and is the

1311
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,359
first to complete nissan's discussion

1312
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,520
assessment

1313
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,200
in march

1314
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,280
2020 um

1315
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,520
huawei's first year 4g

1316
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,800
run was the first two-part gsma essays

1317
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,640
1.0 auditor

1318
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,599
and

1319
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,319
under two months later our friendly core

1320
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,720
network has was the first to pass the

1321
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,440
gsm nissa's

1322
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
0.1 auditor

1323
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,640
and at the end of last year uh follow

1324
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
took the lead in completing the

1325
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,319
decker scots 1.0 tester for fg and lte

1326
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,200
and we also becoming the we we also

1327
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
became the first supplier that has

1328
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,640
passed the gsm nissan assessment again

1329
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,760
sorry

1330
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,280
both of them the first time

1331
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,240
it's

1332
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,880
besides we also finished the other sort

1333
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,160
of

1334
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,119
positive certification or assessment

1335
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,119
such as for example the common criteria

1336
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,760
in june 2020 huawei uh

1337
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,160
huawei gnob obtained the first

1338
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,960
government accredited common retail

1339
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,480
evaluation uh

1340
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,520
earl four plus for fair game angle

1341
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,599
in the world and they evolved by an

1342
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,839
independent third-party lab level here

1343
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:06,960
are the

1344
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,920
screenshots of above those certification

1345
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,359
certificates

1346
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,240
so

1347
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,400
and here we we trust uh

1348
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,640
where we think the trust must be based

1349
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,160
on verifiable facts which should be

1350
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,000
which should in turn

1351
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,520
be which should

1352
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,599
in turn be based on shared standards and

1353
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,400
also we call it course on the industry

1354
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,839
to work together to make a positive

1355
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,400
contribution to the sustainable

1356
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
development of global unified

1357
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,200
security assessment and the

1358
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,880
certification system for flg

1359
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,000
okay

1360
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,400
let's make a summary about this

1361
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,180
presentation

1362
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,400
[Music]

1363
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
first uh the ensuring of southgate's

1364
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,640
cybersecurity is a shared responsibility

1365
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,119
of academic holders such as mobile

1366
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,280
network operators vendors application

1367
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,640
providers and regulators extra

1368
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,720
and i think

1369
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,520
this segment has been

1370
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,760
reflected by the gsma foundation

1371
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,319
knowledge base a fairly cyber security

1372
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,240
knowledge base and also

1373
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,920
we have discussed

1374
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,359
the exact responsibilities in through a

1375
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,280
layered security model

1376
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,760
and the third and the second

1377
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,359
point is

1378
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,960
three principles for top-level design of

1379
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,520
cyber security are consensuals in the

1380
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,839
industrial in-depth defense their trust

1381
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,280
anthropology and

1382
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,960
adaptive security

1383
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,359
and also for failure networks and nissan

1384
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,760
scots provides the

1385
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,240
right handle of standards

1386
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,000
because they are customized they are

1387
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,640
authoritative global efficient unified

1388
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,680
open and

1389
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,440
constantly evolving

1390
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,839
