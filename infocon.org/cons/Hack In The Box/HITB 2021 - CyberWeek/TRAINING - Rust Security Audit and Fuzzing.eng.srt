uh i will be giving my rest um security

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
audits and fuzzing training at uh hiking

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,080
the box cyber week

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,599

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
we're gonna learn um everything you need

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
to learn about trust basically and rest

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,680
security or its work

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,160
um which kind of security and ability

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
are like the most common or to detect

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
them and or to write better code

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,719
basically

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,040
for the second day we're going to start

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
doing some fuzzing

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
and find some real bug into a real

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
target it will be only real target like

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
libraries that are used by thousand and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
even millions of uh project so that will

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,239
be really interesting and you will maybe

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,960
even find some all day we will see

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
and basically the third day will be the

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,440
continuation of the second day regarding

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
fuzzing uh but we will um in addition to

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
us and do the exercise that are there um

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
i'm planning to have something a bit

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,640
more interactive where basically you

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
will come with your own target

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
like you will select

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
whatever target is the most interesting

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
for you that is written in rest and we

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,439
will try together with the with the

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
class to

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,960
build the first target find some

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
vulnerability and

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,159
yeah it will be i think a lot of fun so

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,240
