1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,559
thank you everyone for joining us today

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,200
i'm happy to to be here

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,799
in abu dhabi to deliver this talk

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,400
from uh workplace two to a workforce

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
we'll try to examine uh whether we have

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
found uh new things or new

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
understandings uh as a result of the

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
kovic 19 pandemic

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,640
uh that we all are

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
coping

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,960
uh from and learning to to live with

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
um

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,520
so

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,559
one of the most important things that we

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,480
have all done as

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,440
a result of the pandemic is that in

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
order to maintain our

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,000
business continuity

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,160
we literally uh

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,520
move to

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
a you know working from home in full

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
capacity

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
uh this was never something that uh most

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
of the companies out there have intended

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,799
to do

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
to be a 100 virtual workforce or

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
uh to maintain an infrastructure or

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
architecture that would support such a

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
thing

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
what we have seen is that remote access

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
has become

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
pretty much the the norm

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
as

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
organizations had to

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,240
support an entirely remote workforces in

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
order to support their business

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,240
continuity

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
we all know that this had created a

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,720
situation in which

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
the gap between ideal security and

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,560
actual security had exponentially

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
grew and we will be talking about it

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
in length

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
in the next few

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
slides

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,759
the other the other interesting thing is

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,560
that

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
if you think about it

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
not really a lot has changed

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,640
it's not that working from home at the

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
pandemic era has changed the fact that

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
we

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
share our home network with our vacuum

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
cleaners with our tvs

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
our audio receivers our wireless

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,038
speakers

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,800
our thermostats and worst of all

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
with our other family members

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,400
i don't know if

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
you guys have seen this or experienced

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
the same but i'm sure you did um i have

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
three kids and

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,360
they all have ipads and um

64
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
i seriously don't know what they're

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
pressing and what they're doing and uh

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
what does this mean to my entire network

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
security now

68
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
um it's not that we're gonna

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,239
install a new router and by the way

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,760
possibly or iphone uh arm processor is

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,720
gonna be

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
much more faster and capable than that

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,879
router cpu

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
so we have to leave it the same way that

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
any remote worker had to to live with

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,319
prior to the pandemic so nothing has

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
changed but rather than numbers

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
and the fact that maybe the

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,519
people

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
now being much more educated about the

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,400
issues that that we face

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
um

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
when we look at security and when we

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
look at our problems we look at the

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,800
models that we we used

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
we started from the google

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
castle model where were things were

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
pretty much uh

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
simple we had a

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
very good

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
understanding of what are the

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
perimeter

93
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
idea is

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
you can see that it was pretty much a

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
drone it was built around

96
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,599
those physical boxes that

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
literally created a physical separation

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,280
between

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,720
us and them

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
and who are those us and them were it

101
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,879
pretty much were the people that

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
id had given

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,959
devices to controlled

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,040
and basically limited

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
their access

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,560
due to the fact that we thought that the

107
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
fact that we gave devices to to our

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
users means that we can trust them

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
better than

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
others who were not part of our

111
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
organizations did not have a device from

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,918
the organization and we're not under

113
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
the same trustable schema

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,000
that had trust as a function of

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,759
ownership and control

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,800
um that's something that we

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,840
um you know we all understand now um you

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,120
know that

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
binary and static trust model

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
um basically worked

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,000
in a way that access was either granted

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
or not and once it was granted it was

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,199
literally forever

124
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
if you remember back in the day the only

125
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
thing that

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
you were limited with is the amount of

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
time you could be

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
connected

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
to the organization whether this would

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
be hours days or forever

131
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,160
and then you had to re-authenticate um

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,400
and pretty much

133
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,199
the entire interaction between

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,840
people devices

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,280
and data was static and we pretty much

136
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
you know were able to define what it is

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
and what we wanted to

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
to do

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
the only thing that

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
really was

141
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,479
moving and changing was the

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
attack surface

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,880
so if you remember the the way that we

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,240
used to assess our security back in in

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,080
way back

146
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
we would conduct an assessment we would

147
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,160
understand what's

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,440
not working

149
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
we would change that and we will repeat

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
the process because literally we only

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
had one item we had to to look at which

152
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,720
was again the threat landscape um we all

153
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
know

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,039
that uh

155
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,000
this uh this model had

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
had failed

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
i would argue that this model never

158
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
worked

159
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
that's a you know a discussion for you

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
know after the conversation but

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,319
today it's much easier to to look 20

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,560
years back or 25 years back and kind of

163
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,600
look at

164
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
at that world and try and understand

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,919
whether those models were

166
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,840
good when they were introduced we feel

167
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
like they were we feel like they were

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,000
doing what they had to do back in the

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
day but if we give it the

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,720
understanding that we have today then

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,919
they didn't

172
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
they didn't work from day one because

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
you could literally bypass them then as

174
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
you um by bust them today

175
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
what we are basically

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,199
saw is is

177
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,560
literally

178
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
an understanding that

179
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
all of our vectors are in the move

180
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,440
and we know that

181
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
in today's day and age and actually for

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
the past

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
i would say at least 10 years we know

184
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,160
that that model

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,919
is not working

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,039
and it's not working because we now need

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
to support a situation in which anywhere

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,240
anytime access is given to

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,000
users that not all of them are ours ours

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
using devices that are has not been

191
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,720
commissioned by all of them by us

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
supporting applications that we don't

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
literally own and basically allowing all

194
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
of it to to operate in order to maintain

195
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,199
our business

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,400
so that anywhere anytime access which as

197
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
is is needed

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
for remote access and was always needed

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,360
for

200
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
remote access to

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
the applications by those employees

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,039
working from home

203
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
that usually just want to get their work

204
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
done by using whatever devices they feel

205
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,560
like using and accessing any type of

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
application they need

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
literally

208
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,360
is only one example

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
of why this model never worked we can of

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
course now add the rest of the estate of

211
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
our

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
other users that needs the same type of

213
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
access due to the pandemic and that

214
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,800
attack surface had been

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
exponentially grew because now everyone

216
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
works from home and need that type of

217
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,879
type of an access in our and our

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
organizations in some senses

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
we're not

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
really

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
prepared to to something like this

222
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,479
now the the growth in remote work um

223
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,879
also has led to increasing the use of

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,120
bring your own devices i know of

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
examples that uh

226
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,279
some companies have basically

227
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,200
allowed their users to use their home

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
machines

229
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
they're not they don't even know what

230
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,519
those machines are running just for them

231
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
to maintain their business continuity

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
so literally

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
this provides a great entry point to an

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
organization's environment

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,920
um

236
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
the end point is

237
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
uh the

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
actual

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
well i'll i'll say like that the

240
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
endpoint is the best entry point you can

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
hope for getting

242
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,920
into an an organization these days we'll

243
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,279
talk about this in a few slides and

244
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
we'll show some examples

245
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,000
and

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
looking at it

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
uh we now look at a situation in which

248
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,120
we have no real control over

249
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
the

250
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,040
rules that can be

251
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
provided or we can't really define that

252
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,160
interaction between people

253
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
assets

254
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
and data anymore because there are

255
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
simply too many options and

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,680
possibilities to to account for

257
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
um

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
something that was really really simple

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,760
it now turned into a multi-dimensional

260
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,720
vector

261
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
that we really need to deal with and we

262
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,080
really need to define a different way to

263
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
to provide with access controls

264
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,040
to those who really need it and to

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,839
provide with a security model that can

266
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,720
attest for what we really need

267
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
these days now when i say these days

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
again apologies because we're trying to

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
apply to to the pandemic days but

270
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
literally this is again something that

271
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
we know that does not really work for

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
the past you know few years

273
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
um

274
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
unfortunately there are

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
other problems that we need to deal with

276
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
and

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
a broken security model is not the only

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
one

279
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,640
you know a few years back when i

280
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,959
keynoted about this at the hacking a box

281
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
in in singapore back in 2015

282
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,959
we

283
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,200
had only a few of the problems that are

284
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
listed here as something that uh was

285
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
really applicable on those days

286
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
but now what we can see is that

287
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
certain things had dramatically changed

288
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,399
one of one example is the use of such

289
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,079
applications

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
that

291
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,720
if we

292
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
connected with data sprawl which wasn't

293
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
really a huge problem back six years ago

294
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,760
now gets

295
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,200
data to to basically flow everywhere

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
you ask yourself where your

297
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
organizational data is

298
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,680
and i'm sure that a lot of people will

299
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
not be able to to answer that question

300
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
look at yourself and how you use your

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,240
devices in your applications and how

302
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
you take data that was generated by one

303
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,079
application and you just use it as an

304
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,079
input to another without even thinking

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,560
about it the same goes with your

306
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
enterprise data has gone the same type

307
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
of

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
use by some other application some of

309
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
them sanctioned some of them are not the

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
end result is that the organization

311
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
doesn't really know where it is and

312
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
doesn't really know

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
you know where to find it

314
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
other issues that that we have is the

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
fact that nation states are really much

316
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,560
more closer to

317
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,200
cyber criminals um in their knowledge

318
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
and

319
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,519
sophistication there are multiple

320
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,200
examples for that i'm not going to go

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
into it

322
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
uh we still see that the easiest way to

323
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,519
get into

324
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,600
an organization is just to use the fact

325
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
that

326
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
software is complex and network

327
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480
networking is complex and people will

328
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,279
find a way to to get into

329
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
the organization there's a great

330
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,079
uh quote here by rob joyce used to be

331
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
the head of the tao at the nsa

332
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,880
um

333
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
other issues that we know for long are

334
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
the fact that there is a significant

335
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
shortage in cyber security skills there

336
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,880
is uh

337
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,240
still

338
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
an amazing amount

339
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,480
of data that we need to

340
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
consume sort and digest

341
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,920
about

342
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
um the organization now you ask yourself

343
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
oh yeah we we

344
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
uh we had sim

345
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,839
we have soar we have vdr now we have xdr

346
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,320
and still we're facing the same issues

347
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,399
of trying to piece together

348
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,399
what are the different actions that are

349
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,680
being taken

350
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
by users when they are interacting with

351
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,040
their applications and and data still an

352
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
open issue still an open problem and

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
there's no simple way to to go about and

354
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
and to fix it

355
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,200
um

356
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
privacy

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,440
privacy is a huge topic that

358
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
i'm not sure how many people are really

359
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,920
aware of how much it is

360
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,399
showing its

361
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
effect over security and over other

362
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
fields

363
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
one of the

364
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
one of the main effects that

365
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,959
was caused by the

366
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,720
leaks that snowden did was a significant

367
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
uptick in the adoption of encryption

368
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,760
it's significant adoption in the

369
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
understanding of the public

370
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
of what privacy means

371
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,360
and we see

372
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
that uh those things are still in effect

373
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,399
and uh they are changing the way that we

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,800
do things now with the fact that we have

375
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
more data the fact that it it moves in

376
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,320
much more

377
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
speed

378
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
and the fact that we apply encryption to

379
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,959
nearly everything that also affect the

380
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
different network

381
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,920
um

382
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
based security capabilities that we have

383
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
that some of them are turning dark

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
because of

385
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
the fact that we now use for example

386
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
more certificate pinning and more

387
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
um there are now more voices to to go

388
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,800
about and um you know implement tls 1.3

389
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
for real and not

390
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
um use those technologies in a way that

391
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
will still leave a way to do

392
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
men in the middle of water

393
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,440
um and we see this fight as something

394
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,240
that is uh increasing and not decreasing

395
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,880
and i'm certain that what we're going to

396
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,800
see is that

397
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
capabilities that we may have today at

398
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,760
some aspects on the network will simply

399
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,079
die down because of those things now if

400
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
you're using

401
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,760
google or some apple services that i can

402
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
tell you that you're definitely using

403
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
certificate pinning and nobody can look

404
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
at that data without subverting

405
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
in advance the application although

406
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,120
there are ways for organizations to

407
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
still

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
prevent using a certificate pinning on

409
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
the google apps if they

410
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,880
change some settings on the applications

411
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
themselves on the desktop side this is

412
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,920
something that the average joe at home

413
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
of course is not changing and that's how

414
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
those services are being provided

415
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,519
one of the interesting things here is

416
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,440
that we tend to forget the problems of

417
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,759
yesterday and we're always looking at

418
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,160
the problems of today but the fact is is

419
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,759
that they're still there

420
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,600
they're they're not they're not gonna

421
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
you know they're not gone they're just

422
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
sometimes much more emphasized by what

423
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,720
we are seeing today so whatever we're

424
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,440
talking about now it's the same problems

425
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,399
that we know of for for some time

426
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
they're not new they're just being much

427
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,199
more emphasized by you know the pandemic

428
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,279
and the effects of having more people

429
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,959
work from home but those problems and

430
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
those issues they had been here they're

431
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
they're not new it's just the ability to

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,440
understand how much they're now

433
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,160
contributing to the fact that we're

434
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
not as secure as some people would like

435
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,120
to to think about it

436
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,360
okay

437
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
so

438
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
if we have uh

439
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,639
spoken about uh those issues

440
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
um

441
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,000
for long

442
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
so what should we be doing how are we

443
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,720
gonna

444
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
or what are we need to

445
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,880
be focusing on

446
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
we need to focus on

447
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,440
the data because eventually information

448
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
is what

449
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
um

450
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,079
powers our organization it's what makes

451
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
our organizations viable right and

452
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,839
eventually

453
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
in the era that that we live in that is

454
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,039
what really uh fuels the economy and

455
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,439
that's what organizations needs to use

456
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,679
in order to get more insights about

457
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
their customers about the environments

458
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
they're they're working on etc

459
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,559
and in reality what we have done we've

460
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,439
done

461
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,280
we've gone a complete circle back to the

462
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
beginning back to

463
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,280
what information security is all about

464
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
and i don't need to read to you the

465
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
definition but i remember when i started

466
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,320
you know in in security around 25 years

467
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
ago

468
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
i'm an oldie i i would admit it um you

469
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
know apologize for all the youngsters

470
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
that goes around here

471
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
um you know we

472
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
learned the definition we learned what

473
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
it means we learned what

474
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
uh what do we need to do in order to to

475
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
try and and make sure that we adhere to

476
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,760
that definition

477
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
and what we need to do now is we need to

478
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
do the same thing because we basically

479
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
lost control over all the other elements

480
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
we lost control over the users we lost

481
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
control over the devices we lost control

482
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
over the infrastructure and the last

483
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
item that we were left with is the way

484
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,960
that we need to apply in order to

485
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
control our data and if we want to

486
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
control our data that we will still be

487
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
able to

488
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,679
control who accesses it and provide the

489
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,840
access in the right time and the right

490
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
moment for the right reasons

491
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,280
we need to

492
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
make sure that we

493
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
connect the dots in a way

494
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,399
that would allow us to to to do that

495
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,679
we need to we need to make sure that we

496
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,280
remember that

497
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
what the most

498
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
important thing that we need to have

499
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
is that visibility into what the user

500
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,440
does with

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
the application it is using and with the

502
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
data that is interacting with because

503
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
eventually that data

504
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,559
is

505
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,559
the thing that we need to secure that

506
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,840
data is the

507
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,559
um

508
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,799
lifeblood of the organization but also

509
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,200
is key in order to

510
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
uh make sure that it doesn't go to

511
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
places that it doesn't need to go and

512
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,400
without an understanding of how this

513
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
interaction is happening and without

514
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
that mapping between the users the

515
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
applications the systems

516
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
and the other channels the processes

517
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,320
that store and share that data

518
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,120
we will not be able to really understand

519
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,039
how to build that policy and how to

520
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,679
apply controls that needs to be

521
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,039
you know on the

522
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,520
access side but also on the used side of

523
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
of the data so they apply to to

524
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
different parts

525
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
but not just for the for the access

526
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
itself

527
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
okay

528
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,160
so if we want to look at how

529
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,880
the endpoint interacts with

530
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,559
applications or things today

531
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
this illustration provides hopefully a

532
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,158
good understanding of how it looks

533
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
literally

534
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
we don't have a perimeter anymore not

535
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
one that we can draw

536
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
and not one that we can relate to

537
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,000
we literally live in a world where the

538
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,280
network perimeter itself is

539
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
is gone it's more like islands that we

540
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
have we have the

541
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
device use island we have your identity

542
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,480
island we have the application you use

543
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,440
island

544
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
but regardless of the way that you wanna

545
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
look at that there is no perimeter

546
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
we can't we can't really say there is

547
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,120
one or to say oh this is the the last

548
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
line or this is

549
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
um our alamo i don't think they're there

550
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,559
that line really exists at this point

551
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,360
but

552
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,080
what we really need to understand

553
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,200
is that

554
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
the endpoint

555
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,840
is the vista

556
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,240
point into all the interactions that

557
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
happens between our users applications

558
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
and data it's the

559
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
point where

560
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,039
we have users and identities

561
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,280
being authenticated through

562
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,799
we have developer developers that

563
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,760
are interacting with code repositories

564
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,520
user users

565
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
uh setting up and working on cloud

566
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
workloads um users interacting with

567
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
their

568
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
sas applications with their own premise

569
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,559
applications

570
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,720
um etc etc you will access your your

571
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
you know file storage wherever it is

572
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
the endpoint is is really the center

573
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,559
of all of it

574
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
and it's also

575
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
the center of risk

576
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,760
because if we are allowing users that

577
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,919
use their home machines to access some

578
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,760
of our services

579
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,159
then you can get the picture of what may

580
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
happen if someone will have access to to

581
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,679
those machines

582
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,880
so

583
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,919
it actually is the gateway and the

584
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,360
doorway

585
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,480
into

586
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,240
all of the crown jewels of an

587
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
organization if we want it or not

588
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,280
okay

589
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,880
and

590
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,840
it doesn't take much to

591
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,640
lose control over who's accessing our

592
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
data because

593
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,760
i don't think

594
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,919
that organizations today

595
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
really have a good accounting over

596
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,440
who from an identity perspective using

597
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,760
what is touching their data and

598
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,120
understand

599
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,000
how that is being being done because the

600
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,559
whole idea of understanding what are the

601
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
devices that even belong to the

602
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
organization is something that the

603
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
industry had tried to

604
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
solve for many years

605
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,280
only to fail at that situation again and

606
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
again and again

607
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
looking into

608
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,559
the pandemic we can see now that you

609
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,320
know when you allow home machines to

610
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
connect to your infrastructure or to

611
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,000
your applications

612
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
without any proper provisioning

613
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
or when you have an and

614
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
a problem

615
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,559
trying to to

616
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,679
have

617
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
an inventory of all of those machines

618
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,960
and

619
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
especially what are they running and

620
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
whether they're in a good state then

621
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
the chances are that

622
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,960
an infiltration on one of those machines

623
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
will basically get you

624
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,840
significant damage to your organization

625
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
in some cases

626
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,879
it might be a fatal one

627
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,159
another interesting point is that we are

628
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,279
moving from managing devices to managing

629
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,200
policy and

630
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
um i wrote here that presence is key

631
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,279
so in a lot of cases people say oh we

632
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,120
will be installing

633
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,360
agents on managed devices agents means

634
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,720
software

635
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,120
you know that would safeguard that

636
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,240
endpoint

637
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
and my opinion is it doesn't really

638
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
matter

639
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,360
meaning that i can take the same

640
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
software install it on my home machine

641
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
and get the policy that i need in order

642
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,240
to safeguard the assets of the company

643
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,000
regardless if the company owns my

644
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
machine or it doesn't own my machine the

645
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,279
whole idea is the company needs to have

646
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,960
the ability to

647
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,679
push its policy and make sure it's being

648
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,559
enforced on any device that has access

649
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
to its infrastructure so it doesn't

650
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,360
really matter

651
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
whether this is something that the

652
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,159
company owns or not it's also gonna be

653
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,640
something that would be needed when

654
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
third parties will try to access the

655
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,080
same infrastructure to do whatever they

656
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
need in order to

657
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,679
pro you know to sustain their contracts

658
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
with with the company so making sure

659
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
that we're able to

660
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,400
still enforce the policy does not mean

661
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
that we need to to own the device and

662
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,240
this is a point that uh

663
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,360
needs to be

664
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
um you know highlighted

665
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,679
another interesting point is that a lot

666
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,600
of our security

667
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,840
um

668
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,480
capabilities

669
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,120
are moving to to the edge

670
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
uh back in 2018 i did um a talk at

671
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,679
hacking the vlogs in amsterdam about

672
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
data center security

673
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,080
and we were talking about the fact that

674
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
uh in data center security you see the

675
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
security and the decision maker making

676
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
being pushed to the host and being done

677
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
by the hypervisor and the v-switch that

678
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,840
exists in in those machines

679
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
why because you can't make decisions on

680
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,559
the network because of the

681
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
need not to introduce any latency

682
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,440
to the traffic that goes into the data

683
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
center something very similar is

684
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,320
happening here

685
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,919
what you're going to see

686
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,360
also because

687
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,240
the data is is the network excuse me

688
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,400
getting darker

689
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
the network is getting darker and then

690
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
dumber because um

691
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,840
we use more encryption that the

692
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,760
decisions of whether or not to to do

693
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,080
something would have to be pushed to to

694
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
the end point because it will be

695
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,559
the only point that will know

696
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,279
what data or what action is being asked

697
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,000
and being done before something like

698
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
this um you know will be

699
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,200
uh moved or sent to to the network

700
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,240
in that regards the host becomes

701
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,159
some you know the

702
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,720
center point of risk

703
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,679
uh whether this is accessing all the

704
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,000
different services that uh

705
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,960
we um uh we allow whether this is just

706
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,159
the internet or sanction apps or

707
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,400
any other ones and of course the local

708
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,880
interaction that that host has

709
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,120
with

710
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,600
other channels of um of use

711
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
it's kind of weird on uh

712
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,400
that i can't ask whether you have

713
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
questions because uh we're

714
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,199
doing this in a silent way so

715
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
i'll push forward so

716
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,320
if we look at the um

717
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
if we look at things and ask ourselves

718
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,520
okay so how do we need to

719
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,720
uh and or after what do we need to

720
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,840
apply

721
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,360
um our

722
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,679
the way that we do access management and

723
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,840
how do we need to to look at it

724
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,520
and how after

725
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,640
you know we listed all the the parts

726
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,600
that are

727
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,360
not being done right

728
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,080
how can we actually go about and get to

729
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,679
a point where we

730
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,120
can

731
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
still allow access but

732
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
access with provisions

733
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
and so the analogy that uh

734
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,640
i have selected to to use is uh an

735
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,679
airport security model analogy

736
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
and there's a reason why um i chose it

737
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
because it's a very similar

738
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,960
problem

739
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,320
looking at the anywhere anytime access

740
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,159
by any user right why because

741
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,600
at the airport

742
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
um

743
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,600
what you have is that anyone can

744
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,679
claim they need to be at the airport

745
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,159
right at least at the grounds

746
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600
anyone can purchase a flight ticket your

747
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,279
um the lists that are associated with uh

748
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,240
uh the no flight lists are not

749
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,480
on the websites of the

750
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,120
uh carriers they're actually at the

751
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
at the airport

752
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,000
um

753
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
but the most important thing is that

754
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,520
there's no control over

755
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,159
the contents of of whatever you packed

756
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,159
and security doesn't really know where

757
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,840
it had been

758
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,279
right before you took it to the airport

759
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,360
and the last one is that they cannot

760
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,080
afford to search your luggage

761
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
so if you look at this it's like anyone

762
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,039
can can be there any anywhere

763
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,760
at any time right

764
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
users and devices you can have enough

765
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
applicability to the travelers and their

766
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,720
their luggage and still you need to

767
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,520
establish some sort of a trust

768
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,399
right

769
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,880
to and you need to have checks to say

770
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,279
okay what's the level of risk that i'm

771
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,279
allowing and how am i going to be able

772
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,480
to

773
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,279
check that level of risk and still

774
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,279
provide a safe passage to all of those

775
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,480
travelers

776
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
um you know using the the airport right

777
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,039
so

778
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,240
since uh since i'm an israeli and since

779
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,120
uh

780
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,240
uh

781
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,799
you know our method of things

782
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,840
uh had been built across the years

783
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,960
um

784
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
because of the experience we had to to

785
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,360
go through

786
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,799
the model that

787
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
the israeli airport

788
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,880
um uses uh pretty much fits the

789
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,919
the analogy of what we need to do to do

790
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,360
here

791
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
it's a

792
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,720
it's a multi-stage continuous process

793
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,480
that is built

794
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
by examining

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,600
behavior and

796
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
context at multiple different

797
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
checkpoints

798
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,240
those checkpoints may be linked or not

799
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
with each other some of them are

800
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,200
completely autonomous some of them

801
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,480
provide feedback to the next few ones

802
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
that that follows

803
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,240
but the whole idea here is that

804
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
eventually

805
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,679
what they are what they do

806
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,200
they are adaptive

807
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,240
so

808
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,279
they are designed to make sure that they

809
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
provide a process that if something

810
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
changes if something

811
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,919
you know if a behavior alerts them

812
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,799
then

813
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,480
immediately

814
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,039
there is a reaction to to what happens

815
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,559
here and i'll i'll go through through

816
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,159
this and i explain what's been done

817
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,240
since i became an expert on

818
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,080
airport security since i wanted to make

819
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,399
sure that i can explain this proper

820
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,320
so

821
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,679
at the start

822
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,960
um i don't know if you can see this but

823
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
the outer perimeter of the airport

824
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,980
um

825
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,080
[Music]

826
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,399
has a ditch

827
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,960
okay so no car can go through

828
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,440
other than into the main gate right um

829
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,840
it has an electrical fence it has

830
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,880
unmanned cars it has dogs

831
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
it has other stuff this is what i'm

832
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,039
telling you is all open data okay it's

833
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,399
nothing that

834
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,880
um i'm telling you that it's not being

835
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,679
publicized already

836
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
it has

837
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
all sorts of other

838
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,840
uh capabilities to make sure that

839
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
um

840
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,399
nobody can

841
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,039
just stroll through uh the airport and

842
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,360
just get into the airport other than the

843
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,919
main gate um if you had been to this

844
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,080
airport you know that the passenger

845
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,600
itself

846
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,519
has

847
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,000
or is feeling because in israel when you

848
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
go through

849
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
when you fly home especially for

850
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
foreigners

851
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,200
from israel they they feel the process

852
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,320
and i explain how they feel it that's uh

853
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,679
um

854
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,840
very

855
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,519
uh it's not a simple

856
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,840
process to foreigners but as you go

857
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,600
through the the entrance

858
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
a profiler

859
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,679
will ask you a question it might be how

860
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,360
are you doing

861
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,320
um etc and they and what they will do

862
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,840
they'll listen to

863
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,840
to your response and they'll try to to

864
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,919
understand what is your

865
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:48,720
uh

866
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
dialect

867
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,720
so they'll try to make a quick

868
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
screening and see whether or not

869
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
you look

870
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,120
a bit tense

871
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,720
you look a bit suspicious in 99.999

872
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,440
percent of the cases

873
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,880
the nobody will stop anybody

874
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,200
but at that

875
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,240
0.001 case

876
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,960
that that works too so there were cases

877
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
at which

878
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,279
uh

879
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,600
people were trying to

880
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,918
um

881
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
to actually break into to

882
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,559
one of the

883
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
uh cargo companies that i have

884
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
representation in the at the airport

885
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,240
um you know the likes the the likes of

886
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,600
uh fedex ups etc and they got panicked

887
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,679
at the entrance so they got caught even

888
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,080
not entering um into the airport or

889
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,399
other uh cases where

890
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,480
people that had

891
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
intentions uh bad intentions

892
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,799
of doing something uh bad at the airport

893
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,919
they were caught too um and by the way

894
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,360
if you are

895
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,080
to

896
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,200
uh go through that without stopping

897
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,480
then there are other measures that will

898
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
stop you away before you get to the

899
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,320
terminal and um there is a reason why

900
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,640
and i'm not really sure you can see it

901
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,839
the road is curved okay all the road

902
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,719
the road is completely curved this is

903
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,119
not to allow you to speed up and this is

904
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,560
to basically

905
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,239
force you to slow down so it gives uh

906
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,800
the response teams more time when they

907
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,239
you know need to respond if something

908
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,839
happens at the main main gate after

909
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,480
which

910
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,719
terminal entrance there's a another

911
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,159
profiler

912
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,280
there's a

913
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,000
metal detector and in some cases they

914
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,918
will ask you to

915
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,520
show your passport boarding pass

916
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
but the main event actually happens

917
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
by a profiler

918
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,159
that is asking you questions about

919
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
why did you choose to

920
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,640
waste your time in israel and be with us

921
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,880
visiting visiting the country and you

922
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,960
know sometimes it's embarrassing

923
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,440
to listen to what they're asking but

924
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,160
they're like unbelievable at their work

925
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,200
uh

926
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
they will ask people where they have

927
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,240
been

928
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
who they have visited sometimes the

929
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,480
names of the people that they have

930
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,240
visited to see whether a person can

931
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
actually answer

932
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,839
and understand or provide proper answers

933
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,920
to to those questions right

934
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,000
um they will evaluate whether the the

935
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
folks are a bit jumpy etc and they have

936
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
a high successful rate of

937
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
you know

938
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,280
grabbing people that that

939
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,520
are not really have you know good

940
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,640
intentions

941
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,520
now the profiling thing will happen

942
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,160
uh regardless if if you do

943
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
an online check-in or you go through the

944
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
counters

945
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,040
and if you're not gonna have a special

946
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,079
you know uh sticker in your passport

947
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,079
while you are trying to

948
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
go to the boarding area if you go there

949
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,560
you're not gonna get you're not gonna go

950
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
on a plane

951
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
okay so it's a must stage before

952
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,400
uh before you will uh

953
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
do that and there are other measures

954
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
people are watching people

955
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
after they pass metal detectors they

956
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,839
will watch the people throughout what

957
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,680
they do in the airport

958
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
uh their

959
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,599
you know pressure chambers for luggage

960
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,839
so nothing would have happened at 30 000

961
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,880
feet

962
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,240
and this is something that the rest of

963
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
the world had used after us

964
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
unfortunately you learn by

965
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
uh experience

966
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,680
and

967
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
eventually there's also the air marshal

968
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,400
which is uh

969
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,720
you know an israeli invention of uh you

970
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
know an armed guard on the on the flight

971
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,640
if something goes a wire so literally

972
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,200
all of this system is designed to

973
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,680
continuously

974
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
look look at the passengers and try and

975
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,119
understand

976
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,560
whether

977
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
there is an outlier there that they need

978
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,160
to take out but what are they actually

979
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,440
doing is

980
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,200
they are establishing

981
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,640
trust

982
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,520
enough trust that would say okay you you

983
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,200
and you you're fine you know boarding

984
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
the plane in most cases nothing happens

985
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,240
it's like

986
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,240
they're not you don't see people are

987
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,839
being dragged you know oh you're not

988
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,839
gonna get on the flight right

989
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,320
but they know how to

990
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
understand that

991
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,440
something is wrong and they build it

992
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
without prior knowledge

993
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,440
about who's gonna fly

994
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
so they have no clue who's on the

995
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,640
manifest

996
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,320
they have no clue that's not their job

997
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
that's the job of of other people okay

998
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,000
that that would flag those things if

999
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
needed but i have no idea so they

1000
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,040
basically build that trust in an

1001
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
instance

1002
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,119
build a basic base basically

1003
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,000
built

1004
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,280
mostly on the context that is being

1005
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,119
provided to them

1006
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,880
who are you

1007
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
how they can identify you

1008
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,240
are you an israeli citizen sorry to say

1009
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,480
that okay that's also

1010
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,560
something that plays a role here

1011
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,079
um where where are you flying to

1012
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,720
uh they will look at your passport uh

1013
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,000
will look

1014
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
uh at which countries you have uh

1015
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
visited right if there are people who

1016
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
visit countries that

1017
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
we don't have a relationship with they

1018
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
will ask you questions about that on

1019
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,400
entry and when you will leave

1020
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
um

1021
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,880
and of course they'll ask you especially

1022
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,359
if you're a foreigner they'll ask you

1023
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,920
um what you have what have you done who

1024
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,599
did you met with

1025
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,760
uh there are ways to attest

1026
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
for those things for example if you have

1027
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
a visitor coming from a different

1028
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,640
country

1029
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,960
for work purposes you can give them

1030
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,119
a letter of attestation and talk to

1031
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,359
security before they go to the airport

1032
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,960
and explain to them what they've done

1033
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
when they were in country and basically

1034
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
it will smooth the

1035
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,880
the whole process for them

1036
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
but the whole idea again

1037
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
is to try and get to a point

1038
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,160
where you establish that

1039
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,960
level of trust to

1040
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,119
um

1041
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,240
let you through and let you to you know

1042
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
board the plane

1043
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
now you ask you ask me okay give us

1044
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,960
examples of when this actually works

1045
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,119
right because hey i just described you

1046
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:29,920
how

1047
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,320
israel airport security is

1048
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,079
being obnoxious to all foreigners

1049
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,880
visiting israel

1050
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
the profiling thing

1051
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,240
works

1052
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
also in disembarkment

1053
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
so when people come into israel and if

1054
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
you've been there you'll see

1055
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,560
two three people

1056
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,839
usually

1057
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,240
uh there will be a woman too

1058
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,079
and they will

1059
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,400
look at your behavior

1060
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,839
and they may ask you they may ask

1061
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,560
people it will look to to some folks

1062
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,920
like randomly

1063
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,359
questions about

1064
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,839
you know why they come etc that's how

1065
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,160
the shoe bomber was caught when he

1066
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,640
visited israel before he tried to

1067
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,800
you know blow the the plane on his

1068
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,480
flight to new york but there were no

1069
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,280
evidence of him doing any wrongdoing so

1070
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,960
they didn't let him into the country and

1071
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,839
they

1072
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,520
put him on the next british airways

1073
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,400
flight

1074
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
back to back to london

1075
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,560
so this method works it's invasive

1076
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,160
and really what we want to go get to

1077
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,599
is

1078
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,079
to have the user experience as tsa pre

1079
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,839
now for those of you who don't know what

1080
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,280
tsa pre is

1081
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,319
tcp is a method where you

1082
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,160
pre-register

1083
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,599
you go through a security check

1084
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,720
and

1085
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
when you are at the airport it allows

1086
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
you to

1087
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
not to remove your shoes not to remove

1088
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,640
um your belt not to remove your laptop

1089
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,560
from the bag so it makes the whole

1090
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,200
process much more user-friendly but it

1091
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
also gives the

1092
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,040
government enough data about you to

1093
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,960
attest for who you are and your

1094
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,200
intentions before you're at the airport

1095
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
now whoever had the experience of going

1096
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,599
through a regular security in the u.s

1097
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,960
and this

1098
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
this is something that if i ever lose

1099
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
that status that you know that is

1100
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,280
something to cry for seriously this is

1101
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,160
like

1102
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,319
the experience of just

1103
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
go through the the line

1104
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,200
you know

1105
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
show passport get the passport put your

1106
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,760
bag go through and that's it towards

1107
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
okay

1108
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,319
shoes laptop everything else belts the

1109
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,920
rest of them shows you what the

1110
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
experience needs to be so if there can

1111
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,280
be a way to

1112
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,200
combine between

1113
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,359
the israeli way of of making sure that

1114
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,960
you get all the

1115
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,480
data that you need

1116
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,280
and this that would be a winner that

1117
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
hopefully you know that is what we need

1118
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,560
but we need to

1119
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
remember that eventually

1120
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,960
user experience trump everything else

1121
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,319
security today is not as it used to be

1122
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,560
security today is basically something

1123
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,079
that needs to

1124
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,400
work with what the business is telling

1125
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,520
us and user experience usually is is the

1126
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,640
biggest line item on on their list

1127
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
if we can balance between those things

1128
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,960
we'll be at the different place now if

1129
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,200
we come back to

1130
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
to the real world and say okay how this

1131
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,599
applies to security how this can

1132
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,119
actually go to

1133
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,520
something that we can use

1134
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,880
in order to

1135
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,200
make our lives better

1136
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,319
um

1137
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,400
then we also need to

1138
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,160
provide a way to to understand

1139
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,880
and get the right context about those

1140
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,280
that are trying to get access to

1141
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,760
our

1142
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,480
infrastructure services data

1143
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,000
applications

1144
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
and it's a bit more than

1145
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,200
what people really think because it's

1146
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,520
not just to say oh yeah um that user had

1147
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,480
a two-factor authentication so here's

1148
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,760
the door is open and they can go through

1149
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,240
that's absolutely incorrect

1150
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,560
how many of you use uh

1151
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,359
two factor i assume all of you right

1152
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,599
how long how long does that two factor

1153
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,680
holds after you need to do the two

1154
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,520
factor again

1155
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,000
24 hours 12 hours six hours

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,760
at that time your username and password

1157
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
is king

1158
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,480
okay so depending if you're owned

1159
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
you can make the calculation yourself

1160
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,400
and understand what someone who may have

1161
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,280
access to your system can do once

1162
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,119
you're done your two factor can go same

1163
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,760
places doesn't doesn't really matter

1164
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,560
so there needs to be something much more

1165
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,240
here something that will allow the

1166
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,359
anywhere anytime any device any user

1167
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,960
but will provide not just a allow or

1168
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,560
deny type of

1169
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,400
a way to

1170
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,760
access applications and data would allow

1171
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,079
something that would still

1172
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,599
allow things

1173
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,880
but with

1174
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,280
an asterisk

1175
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,480
what are you actually requesting

1176
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,760
people tend to to ignore the fact that

1177
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
it's not just

1178
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
your authentication or to attest to your

1179
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,680
identity

1180
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,079
and how how is

1181
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,480
your identity had been proven for

1182
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,560
example username password versus

1183
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
biometric versus

1184
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
uh to factor with biometric is a

1185
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,960
complete different thing right

1186
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
so what is the mechanism that was used

1187
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,359
in order to attest for

1188
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,400
your identity

1189
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,480
does your password has

1190
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,720
um biometric identification is it

1191
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
biometric right

1192
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
can you attest for the password passport

1193
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
itself that the test for you as a person

1194
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,240
say here

1195
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,000
are you using windows hello are you

1196
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,319
using a different method

1197
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,560
are you using some some other way to do

1198
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,480
a test for you is your machine does your

1199
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,599
machine

1200
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,800
has

1201
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,560
the hardware

1202
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,440
that

1203
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,160
can help a test for your location for

1204
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,119
your identity for other things

1205
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
how good is that is that hardware so

1206
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,480
we can take each one of those line items

1207
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,240
and pretty much say okay

1208
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,920
we can provide the varying degrees of

1209
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,240
trust with the information that we have

1210
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,319
even within those different parameters

1211
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,920
but eventually

1212
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
things like location and not the country

1213
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,560
you're in but the network that you're on

1214
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,319
right and the network by the way of the

1215
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,800
resource that you want to consume is on

1216
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,640
is super critical

1217
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,119
to make a decision whether or not we're

1218
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,680
going to allow you to to access

1219
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,560
and to make sure that this process is

1220
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,960
repeatable with every transaction that

1221
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,920
you're requesting

1222
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,040
because just doing this for

1223
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,119
authentication is

1224
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,359
pretty much useless

1225
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,920
but the real deal is to apply this to to

1226
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,440
authorization

1227
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,920
so when you're requesting a resource to

1228
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,359
ask hey

1229
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,839
under these conditions can this

1230
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,560
individual using this device from this

1231
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,839
location that was authenticated this way

1232
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,640
that

1233
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,520
is that his device or her device

1234
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,480
is

1235
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,359
you know

1236
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,599
healthy that runs the the stuff that we

1237
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:36,720
wanted to

1238
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,839
to run

1239
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,160
can access that resource and what does

1240
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,119
it mean

1241
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,480
does that

1242
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,760
host has the ability to protect

1243
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
the data that it will now be consumed

1244
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,560
from

1245
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,520
that resource

1246
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,480
looking at the the risk level that that

1247
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,119
data has

1248
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,960
and that's usually a question that

1249
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,920
nobody is asking

1250
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,440
so if we're not going to be

1251
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,319
looking at the behaviors of of people

1252
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,640
understanding the history of the device

1253
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,839
understand

1254
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,760
whether it's vulnerable or not

1255
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,240
understand its criticality and then look

1256
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,800
at what we're asking from the other side

1257
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,480
what is this asset that we're trying to

1258
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,880
interact with or that application

1259
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,200
what type of data it contains is it

1260
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,280
critical to the organization

1261
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,040
what's going to happen to the the data

1262
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,559
that is going to be

1263
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,079
downloaded from

1264
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,079
from that resource or what does it mean

1265
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,000
to view the information from that system

1266
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
etc

1267
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,319
we will not be ever able to to provide

1268
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,240
with an ability to protect the data that

1269
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,839
we want and of course

1270
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,920
needs to be protected on the the device

1271
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,280
itself if

1272
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,119
downloaded to the device too

1273
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,920
it also means that there is needs to be

1274
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,440
some sort of

1275
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,839
an invasive process or an invasive

1276
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,480
invasive software i'm gonna put it out

1277
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,640
there because it is what it is that will

1278
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,280
be able to track those things

1279
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,200
trying to balance between the need to

1280
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,680
get that understanding trying to balance

1281
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,240
between the need to to understand that

1282
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,359
behavior

1283
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,160
to the privacy of the individual that is

1284
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,800
using this device

1285
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,480
and by the way that individual may be

1286
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,880
using multiple devices so

1287
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,920
whatever

1288
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,599
their behavior may be across all of

1289
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,119
those devices eventually needs to be

1290
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,640
correlated

1291
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
and looked at

1292
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
from one single pane

1293
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,680
so how does this eventually

1294
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,559
correlates to to the things that

1295
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,280
we

1296
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,760
who can access what and there's a reason

1297
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
why i put the bull and the bear here

1298
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,400
um you can choose who's the security and

1299
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,040
who's the privacy one okay

1300
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,720
but eventually

1301
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,480
if you really want to go to the top

1302
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,040
secret data your device will need to be

1303
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,800
you know running the type of software

1304
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,280
that that organization would mandate

1305
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,319
under the condition of the organization

1306
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,800
and it will be a small part

1307
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,599
of

1308
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,839
the entire population of the users of

1309
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,319
that organization that will be able to

1310
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,640
access that data because the value of

1311
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,920
the asset

1312
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,240
and the risk that it poses

1313
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,319
due to the fact that it accesses this

1314
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,559
this data or has the ability to access

1315
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,480
this data is most critical to the

1316
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,040
organization

1317
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,720
and we can't run away from it and

1318
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,559
pretend oh yeah i have a bring your own

1319
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,920
device and i want to access my quarterly

1320
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,040
numbers

1321
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,200
before they're being published to

1322
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,839
to the market

1323
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,800
now those days are done like those

1324
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,079
thoughts of organization prior prior to

1325
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,559
covering 19 are are done you know i've

1326
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,280
been talking to organizations

1327
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
you know prior to kobe 19 and after

1328
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
covet 19 and organizations were really

1329
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,800
open to bring your own device do do what

1330
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,960
you want and now they have much more

1331
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,440
stricter rules

1332
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,880
because

1333
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,040
those endpoints as i mentioned earlier

1334
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,400
on

1335
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,480
they have access to everything

1336
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,200
and if we don't apply a proper way to

1337
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,400
measure

1338
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,079
continuously

1339
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,839
the trust and risk

1340
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,520
with every

1341
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,520
access request and by the way that

1342
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,160
access request might be to a file on

1343
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,760
your machine it doesn't need to be a

1344
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,240
file on the on a remote

1345
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,280
or on a remote sas application that

1346
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,040
you don't own or control which is a

1347
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,680
different story for a different day

1348
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,119
then

1349
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,359
there's no way of of securing this

1350
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,680
and eventually the final piece that that

1351
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,880
needs to

1352
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,520
to be added here is the ability to

1353
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,839
protect that data once

1354
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,839
it's on the machine and of course it

1355
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,000
needs to be addressed in transit and in

1356
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,280
use

1357
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,559
and make sure that those access controls

1358
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,200
whether on access whether on data

1359
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,319
are enforced on everything and anything

1360
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,280
and you're able to to provide with an

1361
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,040
understanding and the visibility in a

1362
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,960
continuous manner to really understand

1363
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,040
what your users are doing and how they

1364
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,920
use applications and how they interact

1365
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,359
with the data

1366
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,520
in order for you to come with a way to

1367
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,160
to apply this in the real world

1368
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,400
because eventually

1369
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,319
those devices and those users are not

1370
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,558
born equal

1371
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,160
