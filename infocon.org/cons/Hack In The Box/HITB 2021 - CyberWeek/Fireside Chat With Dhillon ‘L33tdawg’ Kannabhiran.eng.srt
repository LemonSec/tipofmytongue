3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,960
am joined by my co-his co-host samuel

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,360
and the top dog of hacking the box lead

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,719
dog

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,400
thank you so much for joining us for a

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,039
wrap-up session oh my pleasure man you

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,320
guys have been running an awesome studio

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,800
for the last few days

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
thank you for the first time doing it i

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,439
i think i think we made it work in true

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
hack in the box spirit you know

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,960
definitely i mean there's a reason why

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,558
we chose you to be the pastor

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,000
because you've known us for the longest

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,719
time

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
from 2003 practically right or even

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
maybe earlier 2003 is when we started

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
discussing and then

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,760
i think my first was 2005 back in the

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,559
box

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,280
really yes

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,600
we were definitely in touch during that

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,079
yeah and i used to come to malaysia for

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,719
doing other instructional stuff for

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
for the malaysian powers that that were

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,239
yeah that was the powers that were

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,160
and we used to always bump into each

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
other it was great times goes to show

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
how long it's been right it's been a

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
while and it's been a it's been a great

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
ride

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
so um

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
this is one of the reasons why i wanted

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
you in the in the studio

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
we spent two days talking to friends old

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,000
and new

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
we've had some great memories great

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,920
thoughts shared

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,159
and we wanted to wrap it up in style

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,280
with the man himself thanks thanks um

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,759
let's have you just uh take us down hack

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,720
in the box lane oh man like how much

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
time

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,079
it's your show all the time

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
of money to travel there

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
it was just too expensive i thought

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
how hard can it be

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,280
[Music]

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,960
and here we are many many years later

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
and it turns out it's not that easy

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
but not that hard not that impossible

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
either exactly but the main thing that

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
i've always said is that as long as it's

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
still fun you keep doing it exactly and

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,120
it feels like what we've been doing over

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
the last couple of years

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,360
uh the consistency of that that energy

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
right that we get from the volunteers

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
and from the crew and from the folks

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
that come and we see the the looks on

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
their faces with the hacking stuff and

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,800
getting excited about it we were once

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
those guys right yeah we're looking on

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
the internet and like oh check it out

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
it's like dark song stuff you know i

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,599
want you to be like be able to meet them

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
yeah and now we see these younger guys

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
coming it's like oh man it's almost ah

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
you know it's over hurricane rice game

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
this is all just really cool guys that

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,319
we

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,400
that make up the security industry and

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
so that's really what pushes me to

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,879
continue to do it is because i still see

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,640
that a lot of people actually appreciate

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
it right and they they kind of like

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,239
understand what we're trying to do is

79
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
it's not easy but

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,040
it makes you worth it when you see the

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,159
reactions

82
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,519
indeed indeed

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,560
um

84
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
i have great memories of hacking the box

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,560
so let's do this right let's just start

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
from some of the earliest aha moments

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,319
you and i

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,760
and uh okay

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
in no particular order probably things

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,440
that work spectacularly well and then

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
things where things went spectacularly

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
haywire well i can probably remember

93
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
about the haywire ones that i cannot

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,159
feel like spectacularly well because

95
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,080
whenever anything goes mediumly well

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
without thank god everything worked out

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,239
fine right because uh yeah there's

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
always been times when we were like

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,360
will we make it through this you know

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
what i mean even in the first year i

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
think uh when we were with dr d you know

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,760
denis nyer back in the day right now

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
exactly right i mean we

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
we had somewhere he wasn't dr d then

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
he was always dr d but he never really

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,799
used that handle he was always like i'm

107
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,560
not sure i should say but his handle is

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
like alpha or something

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,000
right so the necklace that comes when it

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,879
comes yeah exactly

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
so yeah i mean uh we've had some really

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
awesome adventures man i think like the

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,319
first time we went to bahrain in 2004 or

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,560
was that 2005 and then you know a year

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
or two after we were in dubai

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
uh so many good memories man so many

117
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,159
good memories trekking into the desert

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,200
remember that time we went into the

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,799
desert they were like the desert where

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
the grug nearly passed out yeah yes i

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,320
think there's many conferences where

122
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
he's nearly passed out so you know i

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
kind of lost track which they said was

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,560
without consuming anything

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,919
yeah it's probably due to the heat right

126
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
like it's desert right what do you think

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
yeah yeah yeah remember that we were

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,680
thinking like why is he not making a

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
single sound normally it is impossible

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,440
for the drug to stay silent like it's

131
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,360
been 30 minutes since he spoke and he's

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,919
like oh oh oh oh i see

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,759
let's go home

134
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,800
here it's time to call this

135
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,320
yeah

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
what i took away from that was that hitb

137
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
stands for hospitality

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
you saw everything through it did not

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,639
matter that there were just eight people

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
out there yeah you had the parties you

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
treated everybody the way they should

142
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
have been no cutting corners you lost a

143
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
metric ton of money oh my god but

144
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
that's the spirit that i took away with

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
and i was like telling my friends like

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,880
this is this is what commitment means

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,800
this is what it uh means to take care of

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
your own thank you

149
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,919
thanks i mean the way i look at it is

150
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,759
that folks have taken time energy to

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,280
make the trip over right very similar to

152
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
this year as well i mean it searched

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
uncertain times that we are in right now

154
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,919
who knows what's gonna happen tomorrow

155
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,680
right like a week ago amsterdam was all

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,520
fine and well yeah now it looks like it

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,840
might go back to lockdown right so

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,759
things changed but people actually made

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
the effort to come and i remember lauren

160
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
odor he drove like from france to golo

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
knows where to make the trip over

162
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,039
because flights were cancelled yeah but

163
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
he did it and we owe it to him to give

164
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,039
him that hacking box experience man i

165
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,639
mean people took their time to come

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,960
right to deliver a talk like even if

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
it's just an hour

168
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
it takes effort energy to prepare it

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
right at least the least you can do is

170
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,919
host them as if it was if it was you how

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
would you like to be treated right and

172
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,280
that's what i always say is if you try

173
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
to make it that it's family we always

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
call it the hagerbox family right that's

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
that's what brings me back all the time

176
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,039
and the family grows larger every time

177
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,280
i'm every time i'm here it is it is

178
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
growing slightly larger yes

179
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
i mean i remember i'll rock off the

180
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
plane jack lagged

181
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
before i even come and put the baggage

182
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,639
in the room first stop is the secretary

183
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,319
yeah it may be 1am there's always

184
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
somebody there there's always everywhere

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
until four or five when you walk in it's

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,919
not like oh at the end of the day

187
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,199
like please can you leave me alone it's

188
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
like hi welcome bright smiles you sit

189
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,639
for a while you talk

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
have a coke or something

191
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,680
then

192
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,600
you may or may not log on to the hotel

193
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
network you'll never know but then you

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
kind of go back to the room and uh

195
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
you know sleep happy and then the next

196
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,280
day begins

197
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
so this type of hospitality i have not

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,960
seen

199
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,039
in other events through all these years

200
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,639
it's always been

201
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
seamless you're part of the crew part of

202
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,919
the ship

203
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
everything because it takes all of us to

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
make it happen right i mean let's be

205
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
honest right it's not just like yeah

206
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
we're the organizers so you know answer

207
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
to us but

208
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
if a speaker doesn't show up it's not

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,199
feeling well the speaker is not

210
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
at his best it doesn't make us look good

211
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,199
either right yeah so we're all in it

212
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
together as in every single person that

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
showed up here played a role played a

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
part no matter how small even if they're

215
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
a volunteer that just i used to say like

216
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,759
you know if you're the guy that's just

217
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
pulling the network cables you might

218
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,280
feel like that's like an inconsequential

219
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
job but somebody's got to do it right

220
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
and without that cable

221
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
exactly you know so everybody who is

222
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,759
who's played a part in hanging the box

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
no matter big or small

224
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319
deserves to be to be to be treated right

225
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
and that's that's it it's just plain and

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,039
simple but maybe it could be a malaysian

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,159
hospitality thing i don't know

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
and that have been of course yeah

229
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,680
wonderfully yeah my first experience

230
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
like that amsterdam was

231
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
because i'd been to blackhead europe

232
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,599
before

233
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,560
and

234
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,000
say okay great it's also the

235

krasnopolski again and those are those

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080

237
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
different vibe came out it was like okay

238
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
this is malaysia once again and then and

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
then holland goes to malaysia malaysia

240
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,879
goes to holland and this was

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
like it became a part of my life my

242
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,080

259
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
folks that actually produce the show and

260
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
make it what it is it's not me man it's

261

264
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
rest of the guys that actually deserve

265
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
the credit right so it's the dutch crew

266
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
the malaysian crew like liang wang daryl

267

275

know they're the guys man like without

276
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,399

277
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,760
just be answering emails and nothing

278
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
would have happened

279
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,420
so

280
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,440

throw the thing around

292
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,760
we quickly had to improvise and it was

293
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
awesome to improvise and

294
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,200

331
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,360
lot of work to make it look right uh and

332
