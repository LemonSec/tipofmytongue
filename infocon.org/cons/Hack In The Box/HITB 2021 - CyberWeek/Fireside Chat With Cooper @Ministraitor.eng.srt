welcome cooper um

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
i've known you for several years now

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
you're uh nothing short of a legend

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
so uh

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
you're the guy who makes me look good in

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
all the talks that i give at hack in the

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,719
box and several other conferences

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,920
um we would like to talk to you about

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,640
how you pull off all the magic okay and

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
what's all the wiring that goes on

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,079
behind the scenes

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,520
and

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,879
everything you do

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
to overcome all the adversities as well

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
sure can you tell us a bit more about

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,199
how you first started attacking the boss

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,480
or by or first started by typing videos

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
for conferences in general so

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
hack in the box was

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,879
i think the

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,040
second conference i no actually it was

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
the first conference i ever volunteered

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,320
for

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
um just as like i was the guy standing

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,880
at the door helping people get in making

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
sure that if you didn't have a badge you

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,600
got sent back

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
um

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,240
this had everything to do with um

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
me trying to get

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
trying to understand conferences better

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,920
because um

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,200
i was

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
i was i was viewing a lot of conferences

43
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
conference talks online on youtube at

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
the time they were mostly american so

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
the defcon talks and that sort of thing

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
stuff that iron geek was doing

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
and

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
the

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,479
um

50
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
it it looked it looked appealing so i

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,920
asked my employer to send me to a

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
conference so they sent me ton of

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,880
conference uh the abstract eu

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
for reference i am a software developer

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
so doing going to an overwatch

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,640
conference makes a lot of sense

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
um

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
and i

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
went hey this is fun i want to do this

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,840
more

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,399
so um i walked up to my boss and was

62
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,720
like hey um that was a fun conference

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
now i would like to also go to that that

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,959
that i know like

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
that is way too expensive we can't do

66
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,080
that

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
um

68
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,760
so i looked into it and going to a lot

69
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
of conferences certainly is expensive

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,000
like doing one or two a year i'm sure

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
for like big ones like this

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
wouldn't need to break the bank but um

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
yeah if you want to do more than that

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
then it becomes quite cost innovative

75
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
so the solution i found was to just

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,879
volunteer for conferences so you'd be

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
able to at least pick up

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
some of it yeah um

79
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,720
and

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
i talked to a friend of mine

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
digininja

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
on twitter who uh i asked him like what

83
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
would be like a really good conference

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
for someone like me to go to

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
and he mentioned a few blue con

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
heck in the box got mentioned because it

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,360
would be local to me in the netherlands

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,519
and he off the cuff mentioned that he

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
was organizing his own conference in

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
sheffield england oh which

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
was of course

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,319
that just blew my mind it was like i

93
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,159
know somebody who organizes a conference

94
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,440
what

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,519
so i told him well i'm gonna come and

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,599
volunteer for your conference

97
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,000
and i'm sure he thought i was completely

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,239
nuts because who travels from the

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
netherlands all the way to england to go

100
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
to his 100 person last time at least um

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
but um sure enough there i was

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
and as i stood there going hey i'm here

103
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
i'm volunteering what do i do

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,599
the person who was doing the camera

105
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,599
duties for um for steelcon uh walked

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
through the door going sorry i'm super

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
late but um we have an hour and a half

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,159
to set up two tracks

109
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
who can help me

110
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,439
so i i was already interested somewhat

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,400
in conference videoing as a thing

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
so i said sure let's help

113
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,879
um i spent the rest of the day helping

114
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
this individual

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,200
filming

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
steelcon best be good but in the end i

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,200
think about 60

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,920
of the talks that we tried to film could

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
be put online and the rest had to be

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
discarded due to the various problems

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
that we had it was cameras out of focus

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
sd cards that filled up

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
the light balance was such that you just

124
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
could not see what was going on

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,560
and yeah all sorts of

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
nitty little problems that just

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,160
completely ruined

128
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
the video

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,000
so i after the conference was over it

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
also took many months before the talks

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
would even become available

132
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
so i talked to the individual

133
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
who was doing the videoing and asked him

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
like how could we do better

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,280
and he had a few suggestions but he

136
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,880
wasn't really willing to follow through

137
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,400
on it but i was inspired so i started

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
collecting hardware

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
putting together what would become my

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,160
first video rig

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
and at the same conference i

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,199
met

143
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,039
aaron finnen phoenix

144
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
who turned out to be organizing besides

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,479
hamburg opposite ccc

146
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,000
when was all this like what this was

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
2015 2015. yes

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,520
so seven years and counting yes

149
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
i mean i keep counting

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,880
um

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
he he organized uh visa hamburg opposite

152
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,080
ccc and um before uh before the event he

153
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
put out a tweet saying

154
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
there's not gonna be any camera there's

155
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
not going to be any photography we

156
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
haven't arranged any of that so if you

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,199
want to see something of this conference

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,400
just show up

159
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
which was my cue to go hey since there

160
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,600
is no video are you willing to take a

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
chance

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
and have me come in with this alpha as

163
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,919
can be set up

164
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,600
to see if i could maybe film your

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,800
conference

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,360
and he was game

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
i actually ended up borrowing my

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
mother's camera to do the other track

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
okay

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
and

171
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
filmed it

172
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
um

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
in the end everything that i filmed

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
there was at least i'm good enough to be

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
put online

176
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
i learned a heck of a lot

177
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,319
um

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,520
but that was what started it off so i

179
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
didn't i did one conference in 2015

180
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
from the from just that conference alone

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,560
i got leads to two other conferences

182
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
that would be interested in getting

183
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
films if i wanted to

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,759
and um yeah in 2019 the

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,120
last year full year before corona i had

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
over 40 conferences in a single year

187
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
that is nothing short of being

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
impressive

189
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680
and i mean i know that people ask for

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
people ask for his services by example

191
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,599
like if cooper is going to do it it'll

192
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,120
be awesome i know i'm i'm one of the

193
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,080
guys who requested to do exactly that

194
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,919
and uh i mean it's

195
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,319
been a pleasure working with you

196
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,560
very much likewise

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
you've uh

198
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
you've been pretty much all over the

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
world

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
how do you manage to

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
get things set up

202
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,639
with perfection

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,400
in record time

204
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
um

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
the setting up bit i am still trying to

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,599
make easier still

207
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,560
um but i've had it's it's

208
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,880
you do something you figure out that you

209
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
have a problem and you you fix it and so

210
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
for the next time you're better one good

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
example with heck in the box is i

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
initially on my cameras i would have

213
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
near the camera i would have a power

214
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,800
outlet

215
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,639
that would power all the bits near the

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
camera and i would have a power outlet

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
on the stage to power all the things on

218
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
the lectern um

219
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,759
until for one two for one talk at hack

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,720
in the box some person decided that

221
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,879
their phone needed charging

222
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,039
and

223
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
so thankfully by then i was already

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,759
showing people what i got because well

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,240
i'm i'm i'm not shy to admit i'm well

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
proud of what i've done here um

227
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
show them like this this is what you're

228
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
supposed to see and when it's wrong you

229
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
see that

230
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
that person happened to just be walking

231
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
by the room where this had just happened

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,520
and

233
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
went and fetched me and it was like oh

234
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,879
yeah this is definitely a problem that

235
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,360
we quickly need to fix

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
and i've since addressed it by

237
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,280
um no longer relying on power sockets

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
anywhere other than where the main pc is

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,679
so

240
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,320
for for most video you have sdi it's

241
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
digital coax i run along with my sdi

242
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
cable

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
literally speaker cable

244
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
that

245
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
takes 12 volts off of the pc power

246
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
supply

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
at camera site or on the lectern i take

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
a converter box

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
schematics are on my

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,560
on my website you can 3d print the box

251
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,920
and i put in a cheap 70 cent at

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
aliexpress or whatever

253
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
down converted go from 12 volt or

254
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,839
whatever is left of it after a huge

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
length of cable

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
um take that down to 5 volts which is

257
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
then again reliable yeah and from there

258
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,480
i feed my camera i feed converter boxes

259
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
on the lectern i feed all the converters

260
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,360
that people use and

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,279
i only rely on power at the pc i have no

262
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,640
external dependencies on the outer parts

263
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
where i also have hardware

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
so

265
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
this is this is something that you reach

266
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
after trying a few things and then

267
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
discovering that things are not reliable

268
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
i can tell you

269
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,800
billions of things about the different

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
kinds of plugs i've used before i

271
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
settled on the ones that i'm now using

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
simply because they have to be reliable

273
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,519
you don't know if the when you pull a

274
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,040
cable if somebody's going to put a mat

275
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,200
over there and subsequently a drinks car

276
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
is going to come out and come by and go

277
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
go over over your cable if you've got a

278
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
flimsy connector there that means no

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
power or something and stuff breaks

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
so

281
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
that sort of thing

282
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,720
so uh i've i've seen you

283
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,079
also

284
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,279
tackle design level issues right

285
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
one of the things before you started

286
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,040
doing the conference videos

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,200
whenever i would see conference talks

288
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
being recorded

289
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,360
it's

290
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
some sort of an ugly combination of

291
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
slides being projected half of them

292
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
projected on the speaker's face and that

293
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
whole thing being recorded

294
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,279
you can barely make out either the

295
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,200
person's face or you can make out the

296
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
slides but not both at the same time and

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
somehow you bumble through it the

298
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,279
recording exists just for the sake of

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720
recording

300
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
what i've seen you do

301
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
is you've created this beautiful layout

302
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
right you have figured out through i

303
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
think design thinking

304
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,279
that speakers are standing up so you

305
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,880
give them the left column for the

306
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
speaker they have the logo then you have

307
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,519
the slides and everything is so crisp

308
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,440
clear balanced

309
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
audio is good

310
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,519
how do you make that whole thing happen

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,760
what's the what's your rig and thought

312
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,959
process magic i i got when i was doing

313
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,560
so for the first

314
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,519
videos that i made i was filming in a

315
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
landscape for the camera and you get

316
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,120
landscape from the slides and then i had

317
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
the trouble of how do you now combine

318
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,440
that in yet another landscape thing so

319
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,680
you end up with doing things like the

320
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,399
text on the slide is here so i put the

321
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,640
camera the the image from the camera

322
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,519
over there next slide the text is now on

323
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,079
the bottom so you put the image and you

324
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,079
practically get c6 from watching it and

325
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,959
it is a heck of a lot of work for you in

326
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
editing after you've recorded something

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,519
to get this right

328
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,959
so

329
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,920
the end result was just that the method

330
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,560
whilst it looked good enough

331
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
the main reason for doing it differently

332
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
was that this method didn't scale

333
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,279
yeah so i focused on saying i want the

334
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,600
slide to be visible throughout because

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,959
the one thing that absolutely annoyed me

336
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
about watching conference videos is that

337
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,040
you would have the speaker

338
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,639
somebody would decide that they wanted

339
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,760
the speaker full frame yeah um so no

340
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,920
slide visible at all and the speaker is

341
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,160
at that point describing something on

342
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
the slide

343
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
where you're going like that would be

344
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,200
nice to have seen yeah

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,639
so um i switched to our switch i went

346
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,720
for a format where you would just

347
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
see the slide throughout the slide is

348
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
also the bulk of the visual

349
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
um and the

350
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
the camera is actually not really that

351
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,279
important it helps to get a bit of feel

352
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,560
about

353
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
what the person's about and what they're

354
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
doing it just makes for a more pleasant

355
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
viewing experience but for actually

356
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
giving the meat of the talk the content

357
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,720
you don't necessarily need the camera

358
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
it's just pleasant

359
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
it's a huge improvement over just uh

360
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
slides with voice coming in versus

361
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
slides with

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
a person

363
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
that you see speaking it it actually

364
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
makes the presentation alive

365
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,519
it doesn't look like just a voiceover

366
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,480
and a

367
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,040
and a narration yes it's it's certainly

368
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
lie we had a lot of that with the um

369
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
live streams where

370
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,519
people would go um yeah i just i just

371
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,440
i'm i'm so filled up with being on

372
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
camera for work and whatnot i'm just

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,120
gonna do my recording for my talk with

374
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
the camera off

375
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
and

376
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
if you then look at that you genuinely

377
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
go why

378
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
yes because it's so much easier to

379
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
follow a presentation when you have

380
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,519
someone sending it to you when you see

381
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,639
their face

382
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
yeah

383
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,760
you get some more you get some emotion

384
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
from that and you can see that the

385
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,079
person presenting this is like really

386
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,800
excited about the thing and yeah and and

387
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
it's it's intoxicating to see somebody

388
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,279
give like an inspired talk um yeah

389
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,720
level up yes and

390
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
i don't see how you could possibly do

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,120
that

392
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,839
without having a camera on this person

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
even like some suppressed nuances like a

394
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,480
little smile or

395
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
an expression like this you you catch

396
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
your mind as a viewer catches everything

397
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
that's what you go to an event for like

398
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,279
you want in the real thing this this

399
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,360
gives as close to the real thing as

400
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
possible yeah yes and if you if you're

401
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,760
not actually looking at percentage you

402
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,279
might as well just be reading a book or

403
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
an art school explaining it in paper

404
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,600
you just desync you end up you end up

405
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
de-syncing it just becomes background

406
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,920
background noise and then like the slide

407
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
plays and you're off doing something

408
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,560
else you hear from from people that that

409
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
are after the conference very loudly

410
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,519
going i want the slide deck because i

411
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
don't want to see the video for

412
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
reasons such as i for me it's just more

413
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
efficient to just see the slide that i

414
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,760
can from the slide deck i can pretty

415
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,800
much

416
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
think what the entire talk is going to

417
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
be i find it impressive but some people

418
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
can do that

419
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,040
um

420
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
hack in the box is one of the few places

421
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
that actually collects the slide deck of

422
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,600
everybody and publishes them

423
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
it's not something i see with most

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,040
conferences

425
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
and you just you're gonna have to rely

426
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
on the video and if the video is then

427
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
dull or boring

428
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,240
then it just becomes difficult

429
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
my first experience

430
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
of you know seeing your output was at

431
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
hackaloo

432
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,199
i don't know when

433
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,000
many heckles ago is all i'm going to say

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,880
but

435
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
once i finished my talk

436
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,880
by the time i got coffee and i got back

437
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
into the track

438
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
you'd publish the talk on youtube yep i

439
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
believe it was 13 minutes

440
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,639
i know it was less than 15 so i'm just

441
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,279
going to go with 13 good prime number

442
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
but how the heck did you pull that off

443
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,639
within 13 minutes

444
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
from me

445
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,240
rocking off the stage

446
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
and being up on youtube

447
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
i've made a very big point of

448
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
streamlining the process

449
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,519
so that

450
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,639
because

451
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,040
nobody wants to work on a conference

452
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
once the conference is over

453
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
once the conference is over it's time

454
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,600
for after party it's time for beers it's

455
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
time to hang out with your friends and

456
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,800
so

457
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
nobody wants to spend a lot of time

458
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,199
doing things afterwards and for my first

459
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,160
two conferences where i was filming

460
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,040
things

461
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
the um

462
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
the time i spent editing things

463
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,800
afterwards was several weeks i was

464
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,120
spending my entire evening every single

465
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,079
day working on trying to make it

466
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,680
look presentable

467
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
and like i said that just does not scale

468
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
so i've looked at pipelining and i've

469
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,399
looked at

470
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,360
just

471
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,600
really thinking about the workflow

472
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
and making sure that whatever

473
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,399
goes into a step is already in the exact

474
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,480
format i need it to be so that i can

475
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,199
immediately move on to the next step the

476
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
most notable thing you might notice with

477
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,359
my setup is that um

478
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,679
i am i'm i'm with the hackerspace hack

479
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,480
42 and there are some really nice crafty

480
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
people there who uh one of them

481
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,400
made me a 90 degree bracket for the

482
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
camera

483
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,319
so that i can still use standard tripods

484
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,880
but due to the bracket i am able to

485
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
mount my camera not in

486
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
landscape or in portraits

487
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
and the reasoning here is that by

488
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,600
putting the camera in portrait mode i'm

489
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,559
still getting a full hd image

490
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,080
but this full hd image is getting shrunk

491
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,919
it gets cleans it gets cleaned up and

492
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
then it gets shrunk to uh to like a

493
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,320
fourth

494
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
probably even less of its original size

495
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,799
which sharpens it immensely and gives

496
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,280
the equivalent of having like a really

497
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,039
really good sensor even though my camera

498
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
isn't that good

499
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
but just just that little thing alone

500
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
meant that i get better quality camera

501
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,840
because it looks sharp as it can be and

502
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
the processing of taking the image from

503
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,120
that to this and smaller

504
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
i've completely put that i've made that

505
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
like part of the pipeline so that the

506
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
video that emerges is already in the

507
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
exact size that i need it to be

508
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,760
and that is what i save as like a backup

509
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
because also on the rig

510
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
i've got backups for everything because

511
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
the the the point also with pipelining

512
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,559
is that

513
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
the people who help me on the day

514
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
they don't know anything about video

515
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,720
hell i don't know and i i don't know

516
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,080
anything about the theory behind video

517
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
but i can i can understand if i aim the

518
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
camera that way then what i see is what

519
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
i get right

520
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
so if you wanted to have like a vertical

521
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
sliver and you're filming in landscape

522
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,160
that means you have to know that there's

523
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,480
a line here cropping it yeah yes

524
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
and if you don't know where that line is

525
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
it's impossible to properly film right

526
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,559
so instead i just rotate the camera you

527
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,240
know i have the entire screen and the

528
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
only thing i have to tell you is if you

529
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
see the speaker you're golden exactly so

530
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
keep them new

531
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,679
that's

532
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
so yeah and you look at pipelining so

533
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
i've got i've made a few scripts that

534
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
automate the process of

535
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
um

536
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
a video file comes out of obs by the way

537
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
the best software ever

538
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,799
open broadcast system broadcasters

539
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
project system yeah open broadcasting

540
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,760
system or something sting yeah i never

541
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
know if it broadcast

542
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,039
or broadcaster

543
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
obs obs project on twitter yeah exactly

544
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,720
um

545
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,280
best project ever they

546
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
the video that comes out of that

547
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
i've made scripts that take this

548
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,919
assembled version of the various inputs

549
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,120
that i have

550
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,080
and

551
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,679
that i can just say i'm at frame there

552
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,520
until frame there

553
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
that is the bit that i want to keep

554
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
um which is where the other bit of

555
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
magical open source software comes along

556
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,039
ffmpeg yes where

557
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,360
with when you have um

558
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,919
an mp4 file or it's actually more the

559
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,480
codec so um

560
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
libx 264

561
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
the concept is you have a full frame and

562
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
then you have a number of frames where

563
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
it just changes if you tell ffmpeg i

564
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
want from this frame to that frame it

565
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
can either re-encode which takes forever

566
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,039
or it can do the smart thing which is

567
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,559
just backtrack until we get the full

568
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,240
frame and from there moment on we just

569
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
copy right and because it's just a copy

570
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,120
you're just waiting for io

571
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,080
okay so if you do a one hour talk

572
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,760
i basically have to search back for

573
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
maybe 30 seconds in the video for the

574
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,600
point where

575
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
from where you actually start to where i

576
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
have a full frame

577
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
and then just copy everything

578
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,440
put a little intro in front a little

579
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
outer at the end so people know the talk

580
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,799
is now over

581
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,840
and

582
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
i can start uploading

583
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
obviously i also clean up the audio

584
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,120
because that is

585
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
that varies from place to place that was

586
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
actually what i was going to ask you

587
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,520
about and this is a pet peeve of mine if

588
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
the audio is messed up it's it's it's

589
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,320
pretty horrible it's difficult to listen

590
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,200
to video is in a way

591
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
correct me if i'm wrong slightly

592
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
predictable because the screen is a

593
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
screen and screen output is screen

594
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
output either it works or it doesn't

595
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,400
work

596
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,240
the speaker

597
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,799
is like either there or invisible so you

598
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,520
know

599
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,000
not too many variations about that but

600
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
audio can be all over the place and

601
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
recording equipment

602
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,440
ambient noise

603
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
levels

604
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,039
all your videos are perfectly clean when

605
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,840
it comes to audio so

606
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,120
well

607
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
let's let's uh educate us on how what

608
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,240
those secrets are um i've used

609
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
professional you could say

610
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
devices for this

611
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,559
i use a shure x2u

612
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,520
which is a usb sound card that takes xlr

613
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
in

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
and xlr is like the sound cable for

615
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,919
those who don't know is like the sound

616
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
cable for professional audio

617
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
and if you have any decent microphone

618
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
you will find that it has an xlr output

619
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
somewhere

620
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
so my sound card can use that directly

621
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,559
the other benefit is that that

622
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
particular soundbar sound card is the

623
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
size of a cigar so it's really portable

624
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,479
and really easy to take anywhere

625
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
in most places where i film there is at

626
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,919
least something like a mixer table and

627
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
you can just directly connect to the

628
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,120
mixer table

629
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,720
some places because

630
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
as you mentioned i do do conferences

631
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,240
that are um very small i don't really

632
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,600
care how big it is if you're doing

633
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
something interesting that is worthy

634
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
worthy is like worth of my time and

635
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,720
other people's time to see this again

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,559
then um i think it should be filmed so

637
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
that people can see it again

638
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
and

639
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,480
so i've done like my hackerspace has

640
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
done events where there were like

641
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,559
30 people there

642
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,520
but

643
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
you put a camera there and people can

644
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,320
watch it and all of a sudden it's as if

645
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,080
there were more people there

646
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,720
but there was no mixer so i also have in

647
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,240
every single one of my rigs i have a

648
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,919
condenser microphone

649
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
which you can just put anywhere in the

650
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
room my personal favorite is to uh tape

651
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,159
it to the ceiling uh because then it's

652
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,400
out of the way and it's got like a clear

653
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,120
direction an an an unobstructed

654
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
direction a line of sight if you will to

655
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,919
the speaker so sound is easy enough you

656
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,720
can easily travel there and you get

657
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
really great audio despite there not

658
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,080
being a really good microphone there

659
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,880
so

660
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,279
that's impressive and then yeah the the

661
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,840
only step after that is to use audacity

662
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
to take the audio from the video

663
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
make it look nice you use ffmpeg again

664
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,520
to replace the audio track with the one

665
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,200
you just cleaned up

666
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,559
and you're done and the the the the

667
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,799
magic if you will for

668
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,520
this step is that with ffmpeg

669
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
the replacing of the audio track is

670
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,799
no more effort than encoding an mp3

671
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,640
it doesn't touch the video at all also

672
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
means that there's no loss in quality

673
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,640
right it just like slices it in yes

674
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,039
literally which i i don't understand the

675
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,880
magic about that that is going on there

676
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
but i love it the bits

677
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,960
so cooper you have been doing all kinds

678
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
of conferences for many many years now

679
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
you must have some

680
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,080
great stories to tell by now

681
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
well i do have um this is this is a

682
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,200
thing that i am contemplating doing i

683
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
haven't yet

684
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,919
really

685
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,000
put like proper thoughts into it i've

686
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,279
put the paper

687
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,840
things that have gone wrong i once saw a

688
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,520
tweet from somebody who was a confidence

689
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
organizer and um

690
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,039
the the phrase he was using pardon my

691
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,840
french was a umbrella

692
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
that's the that a

693
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
conference organizer is a umbrella

694
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,640
whenever they're shipped they

695
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,159
make sure that it doesn't hit the people

696
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,360
below but that causes massive burnout

697
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,240
under the conference organizer because

698
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,600
you're trying to do something nice and

699
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,240
everybody just complains

700
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,840
so

701
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,679
that got me thinking like

702
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,559
how many things are going wrong

703
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,039
during a conference just any conference

704
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
and that we are somehow able to hide

705
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,799
from people such that they don't realize

706
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,720
that something wrong something wrong

707
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
something went wrong

708
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,600
just because um yeah we are able to

709
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,120
cover for it

710
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,039
um one of the examples i like to cite is

711
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,000
where

712
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,799
i've set up for multiple or multiple

713
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,320
tracks in a venue

714
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,919
this was a school

715
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,799
um it was a three-track event

716
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,400
and

717
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,919
i am in one of the tracks and one of the

718
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,400
volunteers approaches me and says hey um

719
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
we have a problem with the track in

720
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,600
floor seven

721
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
um

722
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,720
floor seven we don't have a track in

723
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
floor seven turns out that the entire

724
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
sea wing of the building had lost power

725
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,679
that wasn't going to come back anymore

726
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,279
and somebody just made the executive

727
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,760
decision to just lift my entire rig up

728
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
and plunk it in a different room in a

729
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,960
different building in a different size

730
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,600
of the side of the building and they got

731
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
almost all the connections right

732
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,200
almost

733
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
so i show up there it's like okay run

734
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
the cable this one's wrong this one's

735
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,520
wrong right you're good to go

736
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
and we had the track in there for the

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
rest of the day

738
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,559
nobody noticed the thing i don't well

739
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
there was an announcement that track got

740
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
moved

741
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,919
but nobody knows the complexity of what

742
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,679
you just saw

743
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
and i wasn't even there that's that's

744
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,799
the thing that i love the most like i

745
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,720
wasn't even there just some volunteers

746
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,320
looked at it somebody made a few

747
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
photographs of certain bits like okay

748
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,240
this looks a bit complex let's make a

749
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
picture of it so we know how to connect

750
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,679
it afterwards and then it just literally

751
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
just lifted it up alt took it all out

752
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,840
there and plunked it in a different room

753
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,559
and

754
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,200
that was it and i did it perfectly

755
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
that is brilliant

756
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,200
what next

757
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
what's your next uh i mean you've taken

758
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,279
something which

759
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
you know pretty much was

760
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,640
a very uh

761
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,799
what shall we say a subset of a

762
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,240
conference

763
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
videos

764
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,760
you brought it to the main stage instead

765
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,960
yes

766
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
videos are like flowers the best when

767
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,080
they're fresh you publish them fresh

768
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
they get consumed on time they clean

769
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
they're beautiful they've got life in it

770
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
you've perfected the format perfected

771
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
the audio the layout

772
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
you perfected your rigs you've created

773
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,600
your own tooling

774
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,840
you've scaled this you can do 40

775
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
conferences a year

776
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,080
probably 80 if you could do that

777
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
but if i need to convince my employer

778
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
but yeah exactly it's just a matter of

779
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
you know permissions and not that not

780
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
the tools and the process

781
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
but what's next

782
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,200
what do you want what do you want to do

783
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
before corona

784
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,399
i was

785
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,520
i did a

786
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,679
i basically passed the hat around asking

787
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,120
people to

788
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,240
put donate some money so that i would be

789
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,520
able to

790
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,320
make

791
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,559
more of these rigs at the time i had

792
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,840
seven of them

793
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
um

794
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,200
three of them were fit for

795
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
taking uh taking in the air so i had a

796
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
pelican with two rigs in it required

797
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,159
that the organizer provided a few of the

798
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,760
bulkier bits

799
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,120
i had one in a suitcase whereas where

800
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
where i would go to an event that would

801
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,600
just have a single track and i would be

802
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,039
able to film that

803
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,760
but i would bring everything and there

804
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
were the four

805
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,600
golden standard rigs that i would just

806
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,360
throw in my car and drive to places with

807
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,159
but that is a lot of transport and a lot

808
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,679
of logistics

809
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,720
that

810
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
i honestly could do without so and the

811
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,480
other problem was that brexit was coming

812
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,679
along

813
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,799
and

814
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
a fair few of my conferences i'm saying

815
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,760
my conferences that i film

816
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,640
are in england and customs was going to

817
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,200
become an issue if that went through

818
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,360
well it did went through

819
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
and

820
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,760
thankfully before then i had already

821
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,640
left

822
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
four full rigs in england

823
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
there are two

824
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
at two different universities with the

825
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,279
hope they have an ethical hacking

826
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,559
they each have an ethical hacking

827
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,679
society

828
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,000
they do a lot of talks for like their

829
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
own group

830
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
um i would really like it to see you

831
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
like to see them film that

832
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,440
they haven't done so probably has a lot

833
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
to do with rona

834
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
then another two i left with a friend

835
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
who does look picking villages

836
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,399
throughout the uk so that means he's

837
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,760
already going somewhere with something

838
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
heavy so that typically means that he's

839
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
driving so he might as well take my rigs

840
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,080
with it that was at least theory

841
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,760
um

842
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
similar process

843
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,760
when i thought of doing something like

844
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,640
that i went okay and now i want to do it

845
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,080
proper big

846
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,120
um so like i said pass the head around

847
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,600
and um in the end

848
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,679
i was able to

849
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,840
get the money to do

850
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,960
i think it is 21 rigs at the moment that

851
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,919
i have under my call it my supervision

852
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,640
there's four in india two in singapore

853
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,440
uh

854
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
there's going to be two in ireland due

855
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,159
to conan i haven't been able to bring

856
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,600
them there yet there is two in germany

857
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,080
and i still have i think seven or eight

858
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,279
of mine

859
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,559
um

860
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,960
but what i would really like to see

861
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,120
is that people who are

862
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,240
doing an event anything i've learned

863
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,960
that

864
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,600
libraries do conferences yes

865
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,320
it blew my mind when i heard that but

866
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,399
awesome

867
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
there is interest here clearly these

868
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,919
conferences get well visited so

869
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,360
film the things

870
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,279
and if you find it inhibitive or

871
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,880
whatever

872
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,360
have a chat with somebody who knows

873
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
where my rigs are

874
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,320
could be me could be someone else

875
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,480
doesn't have to be me um

876
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,519
we find a way via back channels and

877
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,240
whatnot to get the rigs towards your

878
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
event

879
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,919
and there are explanations on my website

880
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,840
on how you put the thing together give

881
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,919
it a try at home preferably before the

882
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,919
thing starts

883
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
put the wigs in there show people how to

884
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
operate them i can do i can do that here

885
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,120
in under 15 minutes i can teach somebody

886
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,600
how to operate everything and it is not

887
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
a difficult thing to do

888
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,080
um

889
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,679
and in the end you have your conference

890
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,679
filmed or your event filled

891
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,000
so if i could find people who are

892
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,279
willing to

893
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,640
do the logistics as in i'm going to this

894
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
event i'm going to collect the rigs

895
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,559
before i go and make sure that they show

896
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
up there on time and possibly other

897
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,559
people or even the same people

898
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
willing to take these bits and take them

899
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,039
into a space

900
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
and build it up

901
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
if we can find those people that would

902
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,559
that would really be amazing

903
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,000
i'm going to make that my personal

904
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
target for the next event that i'm

905
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,039
either

906
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,480
part of the organization or have any any

907
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,279
say formally or informally in committee

908
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,360
we're going to make that a priority

909
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,600
i would personally love to see a

910
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,559

911
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,600
