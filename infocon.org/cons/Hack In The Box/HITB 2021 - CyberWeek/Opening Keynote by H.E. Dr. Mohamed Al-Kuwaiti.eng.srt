1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
welcome to hack in the box

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,560
we really appreciate all of the

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,520
engagement and gathering from all around

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,920
the world here in abu dhabi

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,800
to

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,920
defend

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
and that's most important what we always

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
actually focus on

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
i will refer to a story

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,920
that

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
we just heard a part of it here

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
i have a friend

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
who used to say i don't have anything to

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,680
hide

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,440
let them hack me

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
let them

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,760
get my data

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,680
and he'd been continuing doing that for

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,879
some time

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
until one time

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,760
one day

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,800
middle of the night i get a call

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399
from that guy telling me his whatsapp

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,640
is actually hacked

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,159
not his device

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,760
not his photos

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
not his pc

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
his whatsapp

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,360
and to him

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,840
that was really

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
crucial as he'd been doing all of his

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,000
communication through whatsapp

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
and not only hacking him but also

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
hacking other

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
networks that he'd been communicating

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
with as well as friends of her friends

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,960
that he actually been communicating with

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
so the saying where

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,079
i have nothing to hide i don't care if

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
they

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
hacked me changed at that moment to him

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
as well as to other things that he'd

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
been actually doing

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
and he was

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
actually trying to do anything to allow

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
this

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
whatsapp to come back to him

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
even

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
he tried to communicate with other

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,439
friends to hack whoever is actually

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
hacked him

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,240
yes he found that link or he found that

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
otp and how he was actually social

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,439
engineered

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,598
in order to get his what's up

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,399
but

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,000
again

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,720
until that return of his whatsapp back

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
we took him again 48 hours until the

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
authorization and

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
many of the authentication happened with

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,599
the main entities

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,959
but he lost

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,599
or not him as a matter of fact but other

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,400
friends who paid some of the amount as

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
the guy was actually again

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
asking for payments here and there

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,000
transferring here and there and they've

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,440
been doing this for

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,599
some time

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
that was only what's up

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,080
imagine if it's a data of a nation

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
imagine if it's health care systems

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,720
imagine if it's a financial

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,920
records as well as systems

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,959
today

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
we gathered here in hack in the box to

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
solidify the importance of cyber

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,519
security

80
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
as well as to ensure

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
those 16 teams

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,959
as well as

83
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
all of the steamed guests who are

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
actually with us here all of the vendors

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
who actually participated all of the

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
sponsors from disrupt ad to many of the

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
aspects that we actually already working

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,720
on to really work together and defend

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,280
the world of cyber from any of those

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
aspects and to build this safe

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,239
and secure happen for fostering as well

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,680
as for striving the digital security

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
that we have uae is transferred from

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,239
various

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
generations from that e-government we

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,239
used to here

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,360
to

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
m-government a mobile government that we

99
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
actually as well used to hear to a smart

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
government nowadays we're actually

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,200
emphasizing on that smartness of many of

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
the smart cities

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,480
and to the artificial intelligence

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,480
government that we are actually working

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
on and with all of the support from

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
private and public sectors and how they

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
will all together help in making sure

108
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
this safe city or this smart city is

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
safe

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
yes we're working together in order to

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,000
emphasize in many of those aspects

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
however the attacks is still there

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,439
ransomware by itself recently during the

114
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
pandemic and during after

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
uh

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,560
or start of this year

117
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
it's

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
really increasing high

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
and

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
the problem with the ransomware is

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
again have you taking your preparation

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
in order to make sure you are prepared

123
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,800
for this another story actually we have

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
with one of the entities and their

125
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
financial sector

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
where they were hit with a ransomware

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,520
and

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
that

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,160
ran somewhere

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
locked all of their systems

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
they called that after the fact that

132
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
they had this ransomware actually almost

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
more than 12 hours after they were hit

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,639
with that ransomware

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
and they only called us for asking one

136
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
question shall we pay

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,520
or

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,759
shall we

139
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
neglect many of those aspects and the

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,199
answer was

141
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,000
very clear from us do you have a backup

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
can you go back to wherever you were

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,880
in a timely manner

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
and their feedback was no we don't have

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
a backup we never took such preparation

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
or actually we had a backup but by the

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
way unfortunately it was on the same

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,639
system so it is locked and we cannot get

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,919
it as well

150
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,120
and

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,320
this is where

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
they decided based on their board and

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
the meeting they have they have to pay

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
and they did pay in order to get their

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,919
data back

156
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
and the amount for the bank

157
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,639
was actually

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,039
not that much but at least their data is

159
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,039
back and the first thing they did once

160
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,919
they paid and once

161
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,680
they trusted that attacker

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
is to again

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,639
get back

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
to their data

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,039
and make sure they have a backup there

166
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,400
in a timely manner

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,919
if that attacker was not honest to that

168
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,039
level

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
and just get the money and run away that

170
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,639
will be a different story and this is

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
where they learned and many of those

172
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
aspects that we have

173
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,440
from any of such attacks

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
so

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
the importance of taking such

176
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,360
preparation is very very crucial for us

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
all all of our data now are in the cloud

178
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
or on systems that is controlled by many

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
of those electronic as well as

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,120
information security aspects so we need

181
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
to make sure many of those aspects and

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
the way we do that is building the

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,039
culture of cyber security

184
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,960
the culture doesn't come from one single

185
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,000
event that we have it's a continuous of

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
such event and hack of the box was

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,479
really proven across many of those years

188
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,039
to really solidify that importance of

189
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,080
cyber security among other aspects the

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
uae have been taken and specifically abu

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,440
dhabi we're hosting many of those again

192
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
events as well as workshops and

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
expertise from all around the world to

194
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,599
really help in enhancing the cyber

195
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
security of the nation as well as export

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,120
this cyber security teams across the

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
whole world and not only spying here

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,319
yes we're trying to be the hub of many

199
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,280
of those

200
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,360
data as well as cyber security on that

201
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
but we cannot do it ourselves we always

202
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
need the help of many of those expertise

203
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
we always need the help of many of those

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
great aspects who've been actually

205
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
sponsoring and working with us across

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
all of those years and we really send

207
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,680
them our best regards as well as

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
uh allows them in continuing many of

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
those aspects

210
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
my message today with this new

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
generations from academia as well as the

212
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
schools who are

213
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
starting in many of those aspects there

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
are more than 16

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
teams who are competing today as well as

216
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,840
different workshops from healthcare to

217
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
financial to automobiles and many of the

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
hackins and risk that you will see there

219
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
let's get the knowledge as well as help

220
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,199
in

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
understanding the importance of the

222
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
sectors and how we can work together to

223
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
really emphasize the importance of cyber

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
security with all of this transformation

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
of the digital world with all of the

226
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,440
things that is depend on iots depend on

227
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,080
networks depend on clouds

228
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
we need to secure that to make sure this

229
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
is really

230
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,000
a safe haven for all of the economies to

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,958
actually

232
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,360
foster as well as emphasize and enrich

233
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
in myths in this aspects

well as doctors to help all of these who

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
really suffered during the camp pandemic

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
no i'm referring to the cyber security

241
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
experts and the digital

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,959
basically

243
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,080

who worked on ensuring the

246
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
infrastructure is always stable and

247
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
secure despite the many attacks as well

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
as the many at trials that tried to

249
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
actually penetrate many of those

250
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,160
networks

251
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,640

people to academia who works on this

254
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
major of cyber security as well as the

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
digital transformation and we extend our

256
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
